        "summary": "The letter, written by defense attorney Bobbi C. Sternheim, argues that the court should grant the defense's request for individual sequestered voir dire and limited counsel-conducted voir dire to ensure a fair and impartial jury in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell. The defense contends that the government's opposition to this request is standard procedure and that the court has the power to ensure a fair jury selection process. The letter highlights the high-profile nature of the case and the potential for juror bias due to extensive media coverage."
