Let's take another example, whether there was ever abuse in New Mexico. Jane told you, told the government repeatedly, she had no specific recollection of abuse in New Mexico. So what did the government do? They kept asking her over and over again - remember, they're trying to prosecute a case about transportation and enticement to cross state lines - are you sure there was no evidence? There was no abuse in New Mexico? I have no memory of abuse in New Mexico. Are you sure? Maybe there was some abuse in New Mexico? And finally, after they asked her four times, she suddenly got back a memory of abuse in New Mexico that she testified to here on the stand, that she said someone came to get her, she doesn't know who, and that her heart sank when she was taken to Epstein's room for the abuse. That's not how memory works. That's suggestion. And clearly, for purposes of this case, the most important thing is what did Ghislaine know about what was going on, if anything, between Jane and Jeffrey Epstein. Was she ever in the room as the government told you over and over? And when I asked her, she does not recall if she was ever alone in the room with Ghislaine and Jeffrey for any of the abuse. And not only does she not remember being in the room SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014505",
