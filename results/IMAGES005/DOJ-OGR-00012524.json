EVERDELL: Your Honor, I understand the Court's ruling. If I can make one other point, which is the fact that Juan Alessi has sort of testified about this, but he left in 2002 according to his own testimony. This walk-through and these photographs were taken in 2005, which are three years later. So the government is -- he didn't say that that photo was there. So I mean the government is making the argument that these important people may have seen these photographs or the fact the photograph was there contradicts the defense argument that the people in Epstein's orbit would have known about this, including Ms. Maxwell, but we actually don't have any testimony that the photo was on the wall at the time that's relevant to this case. THE COURT: We have testimony of Jane regarding art and photographs. MR. EVERDELL: Not this photo, your Honor. They didn't go through with Jane specific photographs, do you recall this one, do you recall that one, was that on the wall, was this on the wall. She gave very, very general descriptions of her recollection of certain residences, not particular artworks, not particular photographs. So I don't think it's fair, on the record we have, to say that this photograph being on the wall in 2005 - mind you, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012524",
