ROHRBACH: It's the same 401 question, although this one is even more attenuated from any motion of bias or motive since it says nothing about her incentives or why she is testifying. She could be testifying for literally or cooperating with the government for literally any reason and make the same statement. It sheds no light on her motives or biases. 8 MS. STERNHEIM: It sheds light on her knowledge that she knows what the other accusers are doing. 10 MR. ROHRBACH: That is not a motive or bias objection. THE COURT: I think that's right. I'm inclined to sustain on that one on the 401 ground. Okay. 13 So I think we're limited to the first question. So you'll work out -- 15 MR. ROHRBACH: We've been conferring and will work out a way for Mr. Hamilton to testify on that point. 17 THE COURT: All right. We can bring in the jury? 18 MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing else from the government. 19 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim. 20 MS. STERNHEIM: Ready to proceed. 21 THE COURT: We'll get the witness and Ms. Williams will get the jury. 23 (Witness present) 24 You may take off your mask.
