It's only the answers that are evidence. I remind you also that nothing I have said during the trial or will say during these instructions is evidence. Similarly, the rulings I've made during the trial are not any indication of my views of what your decision should be.

If I have sustained an objection to a question or told you to disregard testimony, the answers given by a witness are no longer part of the evidence and may not be considered by you.
