MOE: That's more than enough for venue on each count.\n2\n3 So that's all that I'm going to say about the law.\n4 We've proved to you that the defendant has committed all six\n5 crimes charged in the indictment.\n6 I want to switch gears and talk to you about one last\n7 topic. I want to talk to you about the arguments the defense\n8 has made to you at this trial. Now, before I get into this,\n9 let me be clear that Maxwell has no burden to put on a defense\n10 or to put on any witnesses or evidence on her behalf. The\n11 government has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n12 We embrace that burden and we've carried it. But in this case,\n13 Maxwell chose to cross-examine witnesses, to make arguments,\n14 and to call witnesses. You can -- and should -- scrutinize\n15 that carefully.\n16 In her opening statement, defense counsel said\n17 something to you about Maxwell being blamed for something a man\n18 did. Let me be very clear. The evidence at this trial showed\n19 you that Ghislaine Maxwell made her own choices. She committed\n20 crimes hand-in-hand with Jeffrey Epstein. She was a grown\n21 woman who knew exactly what she was doing. And now she's\n22 sitting here in this courtroom being held accountable for\n23 breaking the law. That's what this trial is about. That's\n24 what the evidence tells you.\n25 And at the beginning of this trial, defense counsel\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00014465",
