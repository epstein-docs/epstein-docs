What was your understanding at the time of what the relationship was between Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein? A. I didn't really understand. They never really shared that information. I just assumed that they were married. And then at a certain point I thought maybe they're best friends. And then I thought, Well, maybe she works for him because he would ask her to do things, make phone calls and things for him. So I guess I was just confused. Q. When you would see Epstein or Maxwell, how were those meetings typically arranged? A. It would be Ghislaine calling the house or Jeffrey's office calling the house, like an assistant or something. Q.
