  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 751 Filed 08/10/22 Page 13 of 261 1153 LC6Cmax1 would be admissible if the witness connects these outfits to the applicable timeframe by testifying that they're similar to the outfits she was allegedly instructed to wear. Last, the government references photos taken in Epstein's apartment that depict photos of celebrities. I think the government here represents that it doesn't intend to admit these photos but will elicit the testimony of law enforcement officers that they saw celebrity pictures. Government's brief at 12. Defense notes it would oppose admission of the photos. I'll reserve judgment until I have a better sense of what the government is seeking to do with those photos. MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, can I ask a clarification question on the last point. I expect the government will ask that witness about the decor of Epstein's house and that the witness will say something like there were many photos of celebrities and nude photos of women, but the government would not offer any exhibits that demonstrate that fact. So the government just wants to make sure that that question would be a proper question. I understand the Court is reserving until it hears the answer. THE COURT: I'm reserving on the admission of the exhibits, which it sounds like you're not moving? MR. ROHRBACH: We're not planning. THE COURT: I don't see anything wrong with that question.
