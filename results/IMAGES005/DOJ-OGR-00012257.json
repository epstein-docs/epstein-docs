MOE: That he recalls being present when Jane and 5 her mother were in a room. He recalls Jane saying to her 6 mother. How could you not know the money wasn't for free? How 7 could you not know? 8 THE COURT: Is that in 3500 material? 9 MS. MOE: Yes, I'm happy to pull it up. 10 MS. STERNHEIM: There's been no testimony by Jane 11 about confrontation with her mother at this time. She 12 testified that her mother was irate regarding a guidance 13 counsellor, but she didn't go toe-to-toe with her mother about 14 Jeffrey Epstein. 15 THE COURT: So it's in the 3500 material; it's not the 16 first time you're hearing it. 17 MS. STERNHEIM: I don't recall if it's this witness or 18 her brother. 19 THE COURT: Okay. 20 MS. STERNHEIM: But even if it is in the 3500 21 material, if it is not on the direct of Jane, why can it be 22 offered as a prior consistent statement when it never was 23 offered at all? 24 MS. MOE: This is a statement from Jane to her mother 25 essentially acknowledging she was abused, expressing SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012257",
