If not, end of the day -- is it fair to assume we're not going to get to that today? MS. STERNHEIM: That is correct, Judge. If we were to get there, we would have to do all the logistics about the Webex and I also would need to see if Mr. Hamilton is up to it, physically. THE COURT: Well, you should make that call -- MS.
