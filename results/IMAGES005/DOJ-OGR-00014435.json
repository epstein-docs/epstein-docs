And what you saw in Annie's diary was just how confusing this experience was for a teenage girl. This diary entry was a perfect illustration about how kids being groomed for sexual abuse wrestled with understanding that confusing experience. Annie wrote about how she went back and forth about how this was weird, and you can see her in her diary struggling to rationalize what is obviously inappropriate behavior, because this adult was being nice to her, he had made promises, he was important to her sister's career, and he held a position of trust. That's exactly how grooming works. I want you to notice one thing more about this diary.
