MS. MOE: Your Honor, if the Court's preference is for us to, without a person on the stand, just ask the jury to turn from one exhibit to another to another, we can do that. I think that is slightly more awkward than facilitating that through a witness and pointing out the connections between two things. THE COURT: Right. But the witness is providing testimony over which they have no personal knowledge. You're simply asking them to do the work of the government in the closing. So, Mr. Pagliuca, do you have any objection to the government publishing a few documents, going to a few points, and then we move on, without a witness? MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't understand that process, I guess, your Honor. We're simply going to -- is this with a witness or without a witness? THE COURT: Without a witness. MR. PAGLIUCA: We're simply going to say, The government would like the jury to look at this and then look at that? THE COURT: Yes. MR. PAGLIUCA: I do object to that process, your SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013554",
