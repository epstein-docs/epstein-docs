  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 763 Filed 08/10/22 Page 148 of 197 2689 LCHVMAX4 trial subpoena weeks ago. MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. I can make a representation about the number of names that were mentioned in the volumes of 3500 material. I know your Honor has received the testifying Witness 1, but I can tell your Honor there was approximately 500 nontestifying witnesses with similar volumes of interviews with those individuals. So the fact that we received it on October 11th doesn't mean that's the day we saw this. THE COURT: Of course. Fair enough. I'm just trying to understand why I got an application at 11:54, it was almost -- 11:54, seeking enforcement of a trial subpoena regarding a witness who's been disclosed, a potential defense witness who's been disclosed for months, who the defense noticed and attempted to serve a subpoena on, who, unlike the other witnesses the defense attempted to serve a subpoena on, you received no contact. I know you're busy. I get that. You have a million -- and I mean that genuinely, obviously. I know this team -- both teams are working extremely hard. This one is just a little hard to understand, unless maybe you thought I would exclude the witness. (Continued on next page) SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014254",
