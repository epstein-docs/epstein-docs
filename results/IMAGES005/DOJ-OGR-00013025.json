So that's going to require a factual investigation by the government, and then legal analysis from both sides as to what an appropriate remedy is in light of what we learn factually.\nMS. MOE: Of course, your Honor. I just wanted to flag a scheduling concern. I certainly don't mean to expedite the issue. We'll thoroughly examine it.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Ms. Menninger, is that --\nMS.
