I'm told it was not -- she testified it was not during the period of the charged conspiracy when she was on public assistance, but she did testify to it and that's now on the record, and if these records tend to counter that point, that she had made that point to the jury, I think we could use these records to show that. 8 With the other travelers, your Honor, I think we can come to a practical solution. 10 THE COURT: See if you can come to a solution and you can tell me where we are. We'll break for 10 minutes. 12 (Recess) 13 THE COURT: All right. Where are we? 14 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we conferred with the government. We reached agreement as to redactions and other omissions from this exhibit and we're just now printing new copies of the revised exhibit. We have about half of those copies. It's coming up right now and we'll have the other half shortly in just a couple minutes. 20 THE COURT: Okay. 21 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I have your copy I'll hand up, and one to the government, and we'll put one, with the Court's permission, facedown in the witness box. 24 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Pomerantz, acceptable? 25 MS. POMERANTZ: Yes, your Honor. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014067",
