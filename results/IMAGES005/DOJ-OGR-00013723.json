There were other ranch hands working there?\n8 A. There were.\n9 Q. There was actually, I think you did not mention on direct a chef who was present; correct?\n10 A. I -- I don't have a lot of memories of that.\n11 Q. You don't recall a chef who made meals for you while you were at the ranch?\n12 A. I don't recall a person doing that, but that makes sense to me, that there was a chef there.\n13 Q.
