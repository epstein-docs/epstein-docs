  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 745 Filed 08/10/22 Page 20 of 264 426 LC1VMAX1 as it arises, but wanted to bring that to the Court's attention. In addition, defense counsel has notified the government that they've provided binders of defense materials for the jurors. It appears that -- we have not had a chance to review those materials, but based on a sampling that defense counsel has provided to the government, it appears a large number of them are things like printouts from the internet and otherwise. So we have concerns about jurors flipping through a binder that would appear to contain a wide array of materials that would not be admissible. And because we haven't examined that binder, we have concerns about that. I don't want to delay bringing the jury out, and so I would just ask for an opportunity to be heard about that before the jurors bring out any binders and begin flipping through them. MS. MENNINGER: I'm going to be asking them to look at the binders at the outset at the beginning exhibits. I think we've all come to believe -- THE COURT: We're going to keep doing what we've been doing, which is before the jury turns to it, the defense will tell us what it is. If you have an objection before they turn to it, you'll raise it and we'll deal with it. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: Is there any general set of objections in SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012040",
