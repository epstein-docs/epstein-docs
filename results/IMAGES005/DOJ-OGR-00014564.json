The suggestion that she didn't know borders on the absurd. Think about that Palm Beach house filled with sexualized photos of girls around his desk, in the bedroom, in the closet where the massage table was kept, and think about that list of masseuses. Who needs that many masseuses? You saw that list from Government Exhibit 52-G. And who needs that many massages? Those were so obviously a ruse for sex. The defendant clearly knew what was going on, and she was complicit. She was in the room. So of course she knew. That $30 million is not just house-manager, hold-my-money-for-me money, it is, we-molested-kids-together money. The defendant was a crucial part of this scheme. Now the defense talked a lot about what you don't have here, what's not in evidence in this case. See that for what it is, a distraction. It's a desperate attempt to get you to think about anything other than the powerful testimony you heard during this trial from Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie. Just a few points on this particular argument. First, Ms. Menninger talked a lot about where are the photographs or where are the hard drives. I expect that Judge Nathan is going to instruct you that the government is not required to use any particular investigative techniques. What SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
