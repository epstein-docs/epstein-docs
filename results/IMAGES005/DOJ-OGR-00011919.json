Now, Epstein bought his first helicopter, your recollection was, sometime around 1990, 2000; is that right? 2 A. Yeah, '99 to 2000; correct. Yes. 3 Q. So sometime, I believe, in the early 2000s, Ghislaine went to school to become a trained helicopter pilot; is that right? 4 A. Yes, she did. 5 Q. That school was in Pompano Beach, Florida? 6 A. That's correct. 7 Q. Pompano Beach is about an hour or so drive south of Palm Beach, right? 8 A. Yeah, give or take traffic. It could be longer some days; but, yes, it's approximately an hour from Palm Beach to Pompano. 9 Q. And the training sessions that she was taking were about one to three times per week, right? 10 A. That's correct. 11 Q. Each training session lasted about three to four hours, isn't that right? 12 A. Yes, if not longer. Because there's a lot of preparation before you fly, and you're flying for an hour and a half, and then you're still talking about it afterwards, you know, with your instructor, and then your drive home. So it could be a long duration. 13 Q. Right. So each training session was basically a full-day event, wasn't it? 14 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011919",
