MENNINGER: Your Honor, one other thing. If she did, in fact, give a statement to law enforcement in May of 2019, it hasn't been disclosed to us.\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. My understanding, I was at that very first meeting. I can double-check my notes, which we produced to the defense, it is September 2019.\nTHE COURT: Do you want to refresh her recollection on the date or you don't have any notes from May 2099?\nMS. MOE: I do not.\nTHE COURT: You're certainly welcome to inquire.\nMS. MENNINGER: Certainly, your Honor. On her dates.\nMS. MOE: I'm sorry. My colleague is -- again, I don't remember this off the top of my head, but --\nMS. COMEY: Your Honor, I believe what is possibly happening in the witness's answer about May 2019 is that I believe before the September 2019 interview, FBI agents approached this witness and asked her if she was willing to be interviewed. She declined. And I believe that may have happened around May of 2019. So she may be confusing that as the first time she ever spoke with the FBI. But she was not substantively interviewed and did not give substantive statements until September of 2019.\nTHE COURT: All right. Not sealed.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00012000",
