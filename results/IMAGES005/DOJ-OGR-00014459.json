  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 59 of 257 LCKCmax3 Summation - Ms. Moe Maxwell intended for Jane to be sexually abused on these trips. I want to emphasize here that there is no requirement that abuse in New York actually happened or that the defendant was the one who committed the abuse. The crime is transporting Jane with the intent that she will be abused. Ladies and gentlemen, when Maxwell was helping arrange travel for Jane, when she got on that plane with Jane, Maxwell knew exactly what she was doing, and she knew exactly what Epstein was going to do to Jane. The crime happened the moment they crossed state lines. And to be very clear, when Epstein flew Jane to New York and Maxwell aided and abetted him, that's enough, too. The last element is that the defendant knew Jane was less than 17 years old. And you know that the defendant knew that Jane was under 17, ladies and gentlemen, she met her at a summer camp for kids. She was too young to drive. Maxwell knew this girl for years, when she was 14 and 15 and 16. She would talk to Jane where they would spend time together. Maxwell absolutely knew that she was under 17. And through all these elements, when we're talking about the defendant's knowledge and intent, I want you to think about Kate. She told you about how the defendant asked her to deliver tea to Epstein wearing a schoolgirl outfit. That is striking evidence that Maxwell knew Jeffrey Epstein had a sexual preference for schoolgirls. And after Kate delivered SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014459",
