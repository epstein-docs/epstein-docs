We'll now hear a short rebuttal argument by the government. 5 Ms. Comey, you may proceed. 6 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor. 7 I want to start off by making one thing very clear, this case is about that woman, it's about the children that she targeted, the steps that she took to serve those children up to be abused. It's about her own participation in that abuse when she touched Jane's breasts and Carolyn's breasts and Annie's breasts. This case is about Ghislaine Maxwell, the crimes she committed. 14 The defense just spent a whole lot of energy trying to get you to think about anyone other than the defendant, trying to get you to look away from the massive amount of evidence that Ms. Moe walked you through this morning. 18 Now, to be clear, the defense doesn't have to do anything at all at this trial. As Judge Nathan has instructed you, the government bears the burden of proof and we embrace that burden, but when the defense makes arguments like they just did, it is perfectly appropriate for you to think about whether those arguments make any sense at all and it is perfectly appropriate for the government to respond to those arguments. Here, the defense's theories just do not hold up. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014562",
