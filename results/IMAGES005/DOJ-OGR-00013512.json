You said that Epstein's residence in 15 Palm Beach -- well, I don't think you said this. It was 16 located at 358 El Brillo Way; isn't that right? 17 A. That's correct. 18 Q. Do you remember a time when the El Brillo Way residence was 19 being renovated and Epstein had to temporarily move to a rental 20 residence in Palm Beach? 21 A. Yes, I do. 22 Q. Do you recall where the rental residence was located? 23 A. It was south of where he lived at El Brillo, and it was, 24 from what I remember, right across the street from the ocean. 25 Q. And do you recall when that renovation took place? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013512",
