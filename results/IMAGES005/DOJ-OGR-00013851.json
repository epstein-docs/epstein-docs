I'm just looking at the calendar. The defense case begins on the 16th. We have the 16th, the 17th. We'll do the charging conference on the 18th, if the defense case continues into the next week.\n4 But let me just encourage -- given this break that we're going on and -- here's just the one thing I want to say. I'll hear from you, but I want -- if the defense were to rest on the 17th, for example, then I will expect closings, absent a rebuttal case, on the 20th. Everybody agree with that?\n5 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes, Judge.\n6 But I think it's highly unlikely that we will complete it on Friday, and I would ask the Court to take that into consideration.\n7 THE COURT: Okay. So let's say you rest on the 20th, Ms. Sternheim.\n8 MS. STERNHEIM: That is our anticipation.\n9 THE COURT: Okay. So then we would anticipate closings on the 21st; correct?\n10 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, we would like to at least discuss our concerns about a jury deliberating one day prior to a Christmas holiday. I think that given that, as was Thanksgiving, Christmas this year is particularly celebratory since people were not able to do that last year.\n11 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
