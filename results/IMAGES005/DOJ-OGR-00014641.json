Specifically, you may not consider it as evidence that Ms. Maxwell is of bad character or has the propensity to commit crimes. Instruction No. 49: Defendant's Right Not to Testify. The defendant did not testify in this case. Under our constitution, a defendant has no obligation to testify or to present any evidence, because it is the government's burden to prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. That burden remains with the government throughout the entire trial, never shifts to a defendant. A defendant is never required to prove that she is innocent. You may not attach any significance to the fact that Ms. Maxwell did not testify. No adverse inference against Ms. Maxwell may be drawn by you because she did not take the witness stand. You may not consider this against Ms. Maxwell in any way in your deliberations in the jury room. Instruction No. 50: Uncalled Witnesses - Equally Available to Both Sides. There are people whose names you heard during the course of the trial that did not appear to testify. One or more of the attorneys has referred to their absence from the trial. I instruct you that each party had an equal opportunity or lack of opportunity to call any of these witnesses. Therefore, you should not draw any inference or reach any SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014641",
