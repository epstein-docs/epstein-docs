That would have been the choice we would have made at that point. THE COURT: But you actually had that option with this information available to you yesterday. The government supported that move of having seven alternates and you declined that option. So even with the information that we might face this issue, you chose not to go that route. MR. PAGLIUCA: But, your Honor, my view, that's because we understood that the Court was not going to excuse the juror. That was my clear understanding. The transcript says whatever it says. THE COURT: Fair enough. It was not with a 10-day pause in the trial in mind, and I suppose the new information is the juror telling me that there is some level of distraction as a result of this concern, which was not what was indicated yesterday when the discussion was that they would make every effort to try to move it. Having apparently now made that effort, they can't move it. MR. PAGLIUCA: I understand, your Honor. I think my position is clear and the Court will do as the Court sees fit. THE COURT: I don't want to do a 10-day break in the middle of the trial. That doesn't make sense. I think, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011779",
