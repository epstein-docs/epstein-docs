There were several ways that you could have observed and did observe the passengers that came onto his planes? A. Yeah, if I looked over my shoulder; correct, yes. Q. Or those other ways we discussed? A. At the entrance, yes. Q. Now, of the female passengers on these planes that you observed, you occasionally saw young girls who were traveling with their family members, isn't that right? A. There was some time when adults would bring their children onboard, sure. Q. But you never saw a female you thought was under the age of 18 who was not with her family, right? A. Correct. No. Q. And apart from those times when you saw young girls traveling with their family members, you never saw any female on the plane who looked to you to be under the age of 20, isn't that right? A. Well, that's correct, yeah, I didn't notice anybody of a younger nature without an adult or, you know, a parent. Q. So in the roughly thousand or so, give or take, flights that you flew for Epstein from 1994 -- or 1991, I should say, to 2005, you never once saw a female on any of the planes who looked under the age of 20, apart from the ones who were traveling with their family members?
