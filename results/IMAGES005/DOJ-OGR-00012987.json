But, no, I did not view any other CDs on the day of the search. Q. So you didn't compare the thumbnails with what was actually on the CDs that day; right? A. No. I did view several CDs the next day, though. Q. I'm just talking about on the day of the search. A. Correct. Yes, sir. Q. So any images of photos that were on those CDs were taken off later; right? A. Yes, sir. Q. Now you mentioned about how -- getting back to the safe, there were certain items that you found on the day of the search, but when you went back, they weren't there, but they were returned later; is that right? A. That's correct. Q. So it was Mr. Khan, the attorney who brought suitcases that had the items that were missing from before; right? A. That's correct. Q.
