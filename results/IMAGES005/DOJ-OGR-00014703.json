And so the question is about the element; the charge is about that particular element. I think more guesswork here makes this more confusing and not less confusing. I think, as the Court pointed out, some aspects of this note are about aiding and abetting. And so even referring the jury just to instruction number 21 leaves out that aspect of the jury's deliberations and their determination on this particular issue. And so we think the safest course is to provide the jury with applicable law in this area, and they can find the facts as they see fit and as they apply to these particular instructions.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't think this is a question about aid and abetting, broadly speaking. I think they are talking about the flights to and from New Mexico. I think that much is pretty clear from the note. And whether or not Ms. Maxwell had anything to do with arranging that travel --\n\nTHE COURT: But your legal contention is she can't be found guilty of this count unless the jury concludes that she aided in the transportation to New Mexico. That's not legally accurate, is it?\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the instruction itself says it has to be a significant or motivating purpose for the travel across state lines.\n\nTHE COURT: Right.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
