MENNINGER: That would probably have been on October 11th, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay. And Ms. Moe, did you have something?\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, I was just going to clarify. I think Ms. Menninger is referring to the 3500 materials. With respect to the matters that are before the jury, the testimony was about a Kelly. So in that respect, the testimony would have to mirror the past two witnesses about are you a person named Kelly.\nBut I recognize the Court's question was about 3500 material. And when the defense was on notice of this issue, I just want to clarify in terms of the anticipated scope of the testimony. I can't imagine, given that record and cross-examination of Jane and the Court's other rulings about investigative steps, that there would be anything other than what we've just seen now twice.\nMS. MENNINGER: Actually, I asked one other question of Jane, which was, Do you recall her last name? Because I had it --\nTHE COURT: And she said yes, if I remember, and then you didn't ask --\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
