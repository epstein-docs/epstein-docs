And she didn't identify this person as Ghislaine back in 2007. And it was Roberts who instructed her how to massage Epstein. And Roberts and Epstein had sex while Carolyn watched. And Epstein paid Carolyn. And Carolyn and Roberts left. And Carolyn looked up Epstein's number in a phone book. And she called Epstein. And either Epstein or Kellen would call her, she said.\n9 And on the second visit, the chef asked her if she was hungry. And she was greeted by someone named Sarah. And Sarah is the one that placed towels on the massage table. And Sarah called to tell her about concert tickets. And Epstein sent her gifts. And Kellen took pictures of her.\n14 That's her story from 2007. Not one mention of Ghislaine or Maxwell or Maxwell calling her or Maxwell trying to touch her breasts. I mean, that would be something you would tell the FBI who was there investigating you -- investigating a sex assault inquiry, right? She didn't mention anything about Maxwell or Maxwell touching her breast.\n20 And one year later, she files not one, but two civil lawsuits. And exactly like her statement to Mr. -- Special Agent Richards, she has lawyers, they draft up these long lawsuits. And not one thing in those civil lawsuits, that go on for 70 pages and 209 paragraphs, is there one mention of Maxwell or Ghislaine.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
