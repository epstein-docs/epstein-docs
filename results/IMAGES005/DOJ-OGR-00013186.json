A. I see that it says that, yes, but I don't -- at the time, the way that it's worded is not that Jeffrey Epstein himself called me. Q. Well, there is not a different name is there? It says Epstein returned Carolyn's call? MS. COMEY: Objection, your Honor. A. No. Yes, that's what it says, but it wasn't Epstein himself. THE COURT: Sustained. Q. Then there was a second visit that you had shortly after you returning Mr. Epstein's call to schedule this second visit; correct? A. I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question. Q. Yes. You scheduled a second visit with Mr. Epstein after he returned your call; correct? A. I made an appointment to meet with Mr. Epstein again after I got a phone call. Q. And then your boyfriend, Sean, drove you; correct? A. Yes. Q. And Sean waited in the car; is that right? A. Yes. Q. And this second visit, first you sat in the kitchen and talked to the chef; correct? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013186",
