I kind of looked at it more like a personal assistant as opposed to what I did sitting in the office as an executive assistant. 2 Q. Can you describe a little bit about the difference between your job versus what her job was. 3 A. Sure. She would look after the dog, you know, take the dogs for a walk, take it out if it needed, because Ghislaine would bring the dog to the office. She would carry her handbag and her coat and run out and get her coffee or pasta or whatever. So that's what I saw in the office that she did for Ghislaine. 4 Q. Did Emmy work in the office or did she work elsewhere? 5 A. She worked elsewhere. She was sometimes in the office, but not too often. 6 Q. Were you friendly with Emmy Taylor? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Ms. Espinosa, how did Mr. Epstein typically travel to his different properties? 9 A. On one of his planes, private planes that he owned. 10 Q. Do you know how many planes he owned around the time you were working for him? 11 A. I think three, three or four maybe. 12 Q. Did you ever fly on his private planes? 13 A. No. 14 Q. Did you ever have any dealings with the pilots about SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013910",
