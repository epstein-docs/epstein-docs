And they are already getting some time off. They may be disinclined to want to come back. And that could inure to the disadvantage of both parties, I understand.\n\nBut I think we would not want to be in a position where the jury basically had one day prior to Christmas holiday, and I would ask the Court to be mindful of that, as I am sure you are. And that was one of the reasons why early on when we were hopeful that we could begin this case earlier because of our concern that it was going to bump up, now clearly we are way ahead of what the schedule is. But I would ask the Court to take into consideration that concern that we have.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. Ms. Moe?\n\nMS.

There's no reason for the jury not to be permitted to deliberate. I think it would\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
