List two\n6\ndifficult works performed in orchestra, band, or an ensemble\n7\nwithin the past year. And Jane answered: Nothing has been\n8\ndifficult for me.\n9\nSo what does that mean? The defense spent a long time\n10\ntrying to discredit Jane with a line that was really about\n11\norchestra music. Even Jane didn't realize she was being misled\n12\nthis way until she was shown the question itself on redirect.\n13\nHere's another example: Remember how Jane was asked\n14\nabout a legal document called an interrogatory? She told you\n15\nthat she'd never seen this document before and she had no idea\n16\nwhat it was. And the defense suggested to you that this legal\n17\ndocument means that Jane said nobody else besides Epstein had\n18\nbeen involved in her abuse. There's this long question here.\n19\nBut guess what: Here's the portion that the defendant\n20\ndidn't show you and didn't read to you. It says, Maxwell\n21\nfacilitated the sexual abuse of Jane and was frequently present\n22\nwhen the sexual abuse of Jane occurred. It's right there in\n23\nthat same document. They didn't read that part to you;\n24\ninstead, they plucked parts out of context to create a\n25\nmisimpression.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00014472",
