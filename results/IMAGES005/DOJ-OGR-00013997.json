This does create a bit of a timing problem because it's possible we would get to the witnesses where these issues would come up, so -- 4 THE COURT: All the more reason to work it out. 5 MR. EVERDELL: Very true. And if -- well, I guess we'll address it if we can't work it out with the Court when we come back. 8 THE COURT: Okay. Were you going to offer something there, Ms. Pomerantz? 9 10 MS. POMERANTZ: No, your Honor. I saw something pop up on the screen. 11 12 THE COURT: All right. We'll come back. We're going to need to come back early I think to get to some resolution if we need to. 14 15 And Mr. Hamilton, you're going to confer on that so that we can have that testimony ready when it's time? 16 17 MR. ROHRBACH: We'll confer on the details about how to make that testimony happen. My understanding is the Court hasn't resolved the pending motion to preclude the testimony in full. 20 21 THE COURT: Right. I wanted to know what timing we were talking about for that so that I can look at the papers. 22 23 MR. ROHRBACH: We'll confer with defense counsel about that. 24 25 THE COURT: My quick skim of the papers this morning SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013997",
