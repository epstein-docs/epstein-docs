THE COURT: Okay. MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you. THE COURT: We will do that. MS. COMEY: Just one quick question, your Honor. THE COURT: Yes. MS. COMEY: Is there any sense of when we might expect a draft of the jury charge? THE COURT: It will be tomorrow. MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor. THE COURT: That's tonight's project for the 9 a.m. conference. I don't suppose anyone has a time estimate of closings? MS. STERNHEIM: What's a closing, Judge? I don't think we have an idea yet. As soon as we do -- THE COURT: Do you prefer \"summations\"? MS. STERNHEIM: I prefer that, too. I prefer actually getting two cracks at it, like the government, but we'll be sparse. I don't think we're in a position to inform the Court yet. THE COURT: Okay. But presumably we're looking at SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014102",
