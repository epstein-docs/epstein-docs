I assume the defendant is going to say that she didn't know the purposes of the trips.

That's my conclusion. That's my conclusion. I'm going to look back through relevant portions of testimony on the age issue, but I think even the age issue -- well, not the age issue. Knowledge of age. Specific arguments as to knowledge of age aside, knowledge of age is intertwined with arguments regarding age.
