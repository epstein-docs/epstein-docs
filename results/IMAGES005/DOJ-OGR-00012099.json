If she wants to say she doesn't know what her civil attorney is doing acting on her behalf, I guess she could say that. THE COURT: Okay. So if it doesn't refresh her recollection, we move on. And then if the answer is no, what then? MS. MENNINGER: Well, your Honor, that leads to a potential scenario with her attorney being a witness. But I think we would cross that bridge on another day. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. The question remains about her knowledge. And again, if we're refreshing this witness's recollection with a document she hasn't seen, I just want to make sure that the question is very precisely framed. Because there have been a number of times already this morning where the witness has been asked to just read the document and has given answers like, I don't know, but I guess that's what this says, which is beyond the scope of refreshing a recollection. So I just want to ensure we're not asking this witness to read into the record hearsay statements of her attorney which she doesn't have knowledge. THE COURT: If she says, I don't know, you can try to refresh her recollection. The question is, Does this refresh your recollection? If the answer is no, we move on. And then you do -- SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012099",
