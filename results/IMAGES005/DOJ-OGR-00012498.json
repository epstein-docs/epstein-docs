And then 2C through 2W is admitted under seal for the reasons indicated by Ms. Comey. (Government's Exhibits 2A, 2C through 2W received in evidence) MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor. Ms. Drescher, would you please pull up 2A and publish it for the jury. Thank you. I'm told that the remaining exhibits are in a different set of binders that are not with the jury right now. So we'll publish the remaining exhibits at a later time and I'll move on to another topic. So we can take this down. THE COURT: Okay. BY MS. COMEY: Q. Mr. Alessi, what, if any, supplies were you instructed to buy for Mr. Epstein to use during his massages? A. I don't recall buying any oils or perfumes or whatever for the massages because they were purchased by Ms. Maxwell. MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I'm going to object to the narrative. I'm going to object to foundation. THE COURT: Okay. Q. If you didn't buy them, where did they come from? MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection. Foundation, your Honor. THE COURT: Sustained.
