So whether it's true or not, the question is what is her understanding. So if the question is phrased that way, I will overrule the objection. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. In fact, that is exactly how I phrased that question for that reason. MS. MENNINGER: I still think it's a legal conclusion, your Honor, asking someone, you know, what is the effect of a contract or what is -- how can a contract be dissolved.
