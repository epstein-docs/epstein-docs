And have you agreed on how they come in? 2 they come in? 3 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we've offered to stipulate to what the 302 says. My understanding is that the defense prefers a live witness, but we have offered to stipulate to exactly what the witness would testify to if they wish. 4 5 6 MR. PAGLIUCA: The witness is here, your Honor. It will be quicker just to put on the testimony than to draft up a stipulation and read it into the record. So I think that's what makes sense to me. 7 8 9 10 THE COURT: I mean, I can't force a stip. I can strongly encourage when it makes sense. All right. And then what's next? 11 12 13 MR. PAGLIUCA: The ones that are in contention, your Honor, are transcript trial testimony 1564, lines 4 through 7, and page 1565, 18 through 23. 14 15 16 THE COURT: Let me just get my eyes on it. Okay. Go ahead. 17 18 MR. PAGLIUCA: That corresponds to 3505, 005, page 1, second paragraph, the inconsistent statement is, \"Virginia approached Carolyn at a party and asked her if she would like to make $300.\" 19 20 21 THE COURT: So what's in dispute is whether it was at a party or at the Virginia house? 22 23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct. 24 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014001",
