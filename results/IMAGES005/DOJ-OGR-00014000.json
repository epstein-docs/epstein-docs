MENNINGER: Your Honor, the government and I spoke over the break. We appreciate how lengthy two of the witness's prior inconsistent statement contentions are. We were unable, in this amount of time, to try to reach agreement on all of them. The witnesses that pertain to those two would be testifying tomorrow. The one that pertains to Carolyn is here from out of state and would be testifying this afternoon. So our joint proposal, I think, would be to address right now the Carolyn prior inconsistent statement so that witness could testify or be released this afternoon and then, at the close of court this afternoon, for us to sit down with the testimony and try to reach agreement on the two related to Jane and Annie. 16 MS. COMEY: That's correct, your Honor. I believe there are only three statements at this point in dispute regarding Carolyn, so I think we can resolve that pretty quickly. Mr. Pagliuca, I believe, has the list of the three that I believe are in dispute. 21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor. The two that are agreed to are at transcript 3610, 9 through 15 -- I'm sorry. Not 36. I have 35 numbers in my head. 1610, lines 9 through 15; 1611, lines 1 through 5. Those correspond to the following statements in the 302. 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
