It was yesterday\n8 because this issue came up after the property issue was\n9 discussed earlier in the day, and we felt like we had to find\n10 somebody who could establish her residency at 44 Kinnerton\n11 instead of not just her ownership. We were able to find\n12 Mr. Moran.\n13 THE COURT: I mean, again, I find it amusing, somehow.\n14 The government moved to preclude the ownership documents on\n15 Kinnerton.\n16 MR. EVERDELL: I understand the Court's ruling and if\n17 that's the basis --\n18 THE COURT: I'm letting it in. I'm letting it. I\n19 queried the relevance of it because it was ownership, not\n20 residence, but I'm letting it in because I think you persuaded\n21 me that you can argue the inference of residence from\n22 ownership.\n23 MR.
