I have copies for the Court, and I gave a copy to the government. 2 THE COURT: Okay. 3 MR. ROHRBACH: Judge Chin sets out the summary 4 judgment standard on page 12. 5 THE COURT: Yes. 6 7 Do you want to respond to the summary judgment point? 8 So 201(b), the Court may judicially notice a fact that 9 is not subject to reasonable dispute. 10 MS. MENNINGER: This was the government's motion for 11 summary judgment; and it was Mr. Epstein's admission that 12 that's when he vacated the premises. So I don't think that -- 13 in terms of that's why I think that you need to take both the 14 answers and the summary judgment together, rather than trying 15 to introduce one or the other.

MENNINGER: That's not true. 22 Docket entry 52 is a submission by the government. 23 MR. ROHRBACH: I apologize.
