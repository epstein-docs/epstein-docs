New York is such an amazing city. I felt really comfortable there, like I know that I belong there and would live there at some point, hopefully soon. I miss Maria so much already. It seems unfair that I can't see her more often. I feel like I'm missing so much. There is so much to tell about the trip, but I don't know where to begin. The best night was when Maria and I saw Phantom of the Opera. We went to Jeff Epstein's house and had champagne with him. I found him down-to-earth and easy to talk to. I thanked him so much for the trip, etc. We then took his car. His driver actually took us to Phantom. I didn't know any play could be so moving. I had seen it before, but still couldn't believe it. I bawled. It was fantastic. After the play, we walked around the plaza and went home. It was so much fun. MS. POMERANTZ: Ms. Drescher, would you please pull up for just the witness, the parties, and the Court what has been marked for identification as Government Exhibit 604. You can scroll to the second page. Thank you. And we can go back up to the top. Thank you, Ms. Drescher. Q. Annie, do you recognize this? A. Yes. It's another entry from the same journal. Q. Is this a fair and accurate depiction of an entry from your journal? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013628",
