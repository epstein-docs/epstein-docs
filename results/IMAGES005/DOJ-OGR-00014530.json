It's a French woman taking a message for Mr. Epstein about Carolyn, a French woman with an accent. We're talking about the 2000s now. So one might imagine that there are phone records. There might be phone records about all of these phone calls, right? But there's not. There's not a single phone record showing any calls from Ghislaine Maxwell's cell phone to Carolyn or from Carolyn to Ghislaine Maxwell. And then Carolyn doesn't talk to anyone between -- in the government between 2007 and 2020, okay. She gets a settlement with Epstein, several hundred thousand dollars, that money gets used up, and then she doesn't talk to anyone about Maxwell. And so then in 2019, her lawyer, civil lawyer, Jack Scarola, calls up the government and says, Hey, let me put you in touch with my client, because he's no dummy. And he knows Epstein is dead; and he knows Epstein left behind a pile of cash. So she responds through her lawyer in July 2020, right after the victims' compensation fund was opened. And that's when her lawyer puts her in touch with the government, because again, it helps you with your claim if you're cooperating in a prosecution. And in those 12 years when she wasn't saying anything before about Ghislaine Maxwell, all through 2007, eight, and nine, she didn't say anything about Ghislaine being there, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
