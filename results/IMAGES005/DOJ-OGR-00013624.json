Q. When he was doing that, what was your reaction? A. I was very surprised. I was very nervous and anxious. I felt sick to my stomach. It was not something that I was at all expecting. And I noticed that when he would interact in some way with my sister, that he would stop doing that. And then when he -- when the interaction was over, we were watching -- he was looking forward again, he would return to touching me. Q. What happened after the movie ended? A. When the movie ended, we got up, left the theater. And he said good-bye and walked -- my sister and I walked back. Q. Did you tell your sister about what had happened in the movie theater? A. I did not. Q. Why not? A. I was, number one, very confused about what had happened. And I knew that she was very protective. And if I told her that he had done something that aimed to touch me and make me so uncomfortable, that she would be upset. And that was her employer.
