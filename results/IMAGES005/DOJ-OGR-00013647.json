I just -- you know, I watched what she was doing. And she instructed me, you know, you pull back his big toe, rub this part of his foot, you know. And so I did what she told me. Q. What did Epstein do while you were rubbing his feet? A. He seemed, you know, to be enjoying it. He sort of made like groaning noises like he was -- it felt good to him. Q. How did you feel while you were rubbing his feet? A. I felt very uncomfortable. I did not want to be touching his feet. And also just the whole situation made -- I wanted to stop and I was hoping it would be over quickly. Q. What, if anything, did Maxwell ask you about your experience with massages during this trip? A. She asked me if I'd ever had a professional massage and, you know, talked about what a lovely experience it was and how enjoyable it was to get a massage. Q. What, if anything, did Maxwell do next? A. She said that, you know, she wanted me to have that experience, and she would be happy to give me a massage.
