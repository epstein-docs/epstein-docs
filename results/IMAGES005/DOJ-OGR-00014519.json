What are you going to do? Are you going to take them on a tour of the ranch, spend a significant amount of time taking them horseback riding, helping her get cowboy boots so she can go horseback riding, talk to her about school? This isn't Ghislaine Maxwell targeting someone. This is Annie showing up at the ranch without Ghislaine's knowledge. Annie told you about reconstructing her memory of when this trip occurred. She said it was in April of '96, and she said she thinks that because she thinks she saw Primal Fear, which came out in 1996. She researched that on the internet. And then she talked to her friends about how prom was later that year. And it happened before she went to prom, so she's pretty sure it happened in April of '96. I mean, she's a doctor. She knows how to go back and research things and put it together. And she reconstructed that memory. But when you look at the flight logs, she told you also it was a weekend trip, mind you, and her mother confirmed it was a weekend trip. But when you look in April of 1996, there is no weekend in April of 1996 that Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein are in New Mexico. It doesn't fit. There is a March trip where just Jeffrey is in -- goes to Santa Fe for like a day, and then there's a trip in the middle of May where they both go to Santa Fe, but that's in the middle of the week. There's no weekend trips in April or May of 1996. Okay. So it SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014519",
