Ms. Farmer, what you told the government is you do not remember the foot massage being sexualized. Yes or no? 8 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection. Asked and answered. 9 THE COURT: Sustained. 10 MS. MENNINGER: I don't think I got an answer to the yes or no. 11 12 THE COURT: You did, and then the witness elaborated, and that's permissible, and the question has been asked and answered. So, next question. 15 Q. The notes say you do not remember -- 16 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection. 17 THE COURT: Sustained. 18 Q.
