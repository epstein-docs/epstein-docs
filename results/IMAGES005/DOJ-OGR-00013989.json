If it got labeled as eyeglasses, people remembered it as more like eyeglasses. If it got labeled as dumbells, people later remembered it as looking more like dumbells. That's just an example of how you can label something ambiguous and it will affect people's memory for what they saw. Q. So if two people, let's say, are having a conversation concerning an event, and one of the individuals characterizes it in some colorful fashion that the other one may not have considered, would that be a situation where the memory might become labeled? A. Yes, absolutely. In one of our older studies, we found that labeling something as an incident, which is really fairly neutral, has a different affect than when you label the thing that happened as a fight. People are more likely to construct an image of a fight, probably because of that label. Q. Are you familiar with the term memory traces? A. Memory traces? Q. Yes. Or memory fragments? A. Well, I suppose that every now and then somebody might talk about memory fragments. Just, you would have a bit or a piece of information in your memory. Q. And are you familiar with situations where someone might take that bit of a memory and enhance it in some way? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013989",
