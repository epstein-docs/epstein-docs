Line 4. \"Each party had an opportunity to call any of these witnesses.\"\n3\n4 MR. EVERDELL: We would accept that, your Honor.\n5 THE COURT: It's a similar meaning. It's not quite equal. I'll adopt that. \"Each party had an opportunity to call any of the witnesses.\"\n6\n7\n8 MR.

ROHRBACH: I just -- we will think about it and include it in our letter.
