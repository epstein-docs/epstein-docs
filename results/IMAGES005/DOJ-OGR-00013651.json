Farmer - direct\n1 felt very -- like, I thought I had been brought there because of, you know, one set of reasons; like, I thought that he was interested and they were both interested in me as, like, a student; that they may want to help in an academic way. So I was trying to be sort of impressive in that way and talk about things that they wanted to hear about. And all these experiences made me feel that they had a very different interest in me. And so it was extremely kind of disorienting and I just was wanted to be done with it.\nQ. What, if anything, did you discuss with Maxwell during your last day on the ranch in New Mexico?\nA. What I remember about that, just this final conversation was that I was sort of trying to reengage with her around, like, this academic stuff. And I had brought, like, three by five note cards for this paper that I was writing where I had little, like, facts on them. And we were sitting outside on what seemed like kind of a deck area. And I was going through them and I was trying to get her to talk to me about them, I think, in a way, like, to make myself feel better, like, maybe they did care about that. And she just seemed like very disinterested and kind of like, you know, she didn't care.\nQ. Did you say good-bye to Epstein and Maxwell before you left New Mexico?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Where did you go when you left New Mexico?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00013651",
