So for her, many more\n14 details stand out very vividly. It's less like Thanksgiving\n15 for her and more like a sweet 16 party, something unique that\n16 only happens once, so it stands out much more clearly in every\n17 detail.\n18 For Jane and Carolyn, even though some of those\n19 peripheral details got jumbled, they have solid memories of the\n20 core events.
