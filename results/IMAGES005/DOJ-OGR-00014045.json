That's a fundamental principle of human memory, right? A. Yes, frequency, yes. Q. Now, we've talked today about some of the experiments you have done. And you talked about experiments you've done that involved videos of car crashes, people being lost in the malls, things like that, right? A. Among other things, yes. Q. Now, obviously you've never done a study where you arranged for teenage girls to be sexually abused, right? A. Correct. Q. You've never done a study of how well those girls remember that sexual abuse years later, right? A. Well, I've done studies where we interview people who were sexually abused about what they remember. Q. The question I'm asking you is have you conducted a study where you arranged for girls to be sexually abused? A. No, absolutely not. Q. You haven't conducted a study where you saw girls being sexually abused, right? A. Correct. Q. You've never conducted a study in which you attempted to implant a false memory of childhood sexual abuse? A. We have not. MS. POMERANTZ: May I have one moment, your Honor?
