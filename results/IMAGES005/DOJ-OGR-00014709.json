Clearly they are making an error concerning which state begins with \"New.\" And I suggest that if the Court wishes to refer them to the charge, the Court also clears up the fact that Count Four requires a violation of New York law, not New Mexico law. THE COURT: That's certainly why we should refer them to the whole charge. That's what lines 7 through 10 make clear. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. The only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a statute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This particular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The jury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can't be any risk of confusion for exactly that reason. MR. EVERDELL: I just don't understand the confidence about how there can be no possible confusion -- THE COURT: This conversation is stopping. My decision is to refer them back to this charge, because it is a proper instruction on the second element to Count Four. I do not know what this question means. It's too difficult to parse factually and legally what they're asking. So the only option in those circumstances is to direct them back to the count. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
