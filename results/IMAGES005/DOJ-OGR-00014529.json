And she had lawyers who helped her\n4 answer those questions. And again, she didn't say anything\n5 about Ghislaine Maxwell. And then she even updated her answers\n6 again. So she's looking at her answers to make sure that they\n7 are accurate. And once again, she does not mention anything\n8 about Maxwell.\n9 She had a third opportunity to talk about who was involved\n10 in this operation at the Epstein home. She gave a deposition.\n11 And the deposition went on for hours. And she was asked in that\n12 deposition, Are all of the things in your civil complaint accurate?\n13 Do they include everything? Are they complete? Are they true?\n14\n15 And she said, Yes, they are.\n16 Not one mention of Ghislaine Maxwell in hours of\n17 deposition testimony back in 2009. She may have mentioned that\n18 Maxwell answered the phone once. But guess what? The government\n19 grabbed all of those message pads which they talked to you about,\n20 and there are message pads and there are message pads, and you will\n21 get all these message pads back in the jury deliberation room.\n22 And you will see there's not one single message for Ghislaine\n23 Maxwell having to do with Carolyn.
