She was obviously talented and performing well, and that sentiment was echoed in the supporting materials to her applications, which you will have with you in the deliberation room. That guidance counselor, 3 you know, the one that she supposedly had confided in the year earlier, the one that she said she told about how she was struggling with talking to her mom, that's the guidance counselor that wrote her a letter of recommendation saying she came from a loving and supportive family. 4 She received glowing reviews from people who were well positioned in the community, a board member from the Palm Beach school system who was formerly on the board of the professional children's school where she ultimately went. 5 You see from her applications that she had two different addresses, one that she lived in a house from '94 to '95, and a third one in her application from 1996 when she was 16. She told you she lived in a two-bedroom house and she moved into a three-bedroom house, and the three-bedroom house was in a gated community in Bear Lake Estates. That's someone who just described for you that she was destitute and homeless. 6 She recognized the street she lived on, but not the house with her house number. 7 In 1995, she filled out the application again.
