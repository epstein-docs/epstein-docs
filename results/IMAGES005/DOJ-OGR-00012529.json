MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I'm not sure I understand Mr. Everdell's point about context, because those photos in the bookshelf include a photo of Jane, they include photos of nude and partially nude females. I don't understand the argument about the context. The context had sexualized images of females around his desk. MR. EVERDELL: Jane testified she was 19 when those headshots were taken. So that's the point, your Honor. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I don't think that's the testimony. I believe she testified she was 15. THE COURT: I'm going to overrule the objection. Context, again, matters and distinguishes from the pretrial rulings. You'll craft a limiting instruction and run it by the defense. MR. EVERDELL: Understood, your Honor. There is one last issue with this witness, which is his testimony -- THE COURT: This is Mr. Parkinson? MR. EVERDELL: Mr. Parkinson. So everything we've been discussing so far, I believe, is going to be introduced through Mr. Parkinson. We have the video, the photos, and now his testimony. I understand from the government and from the materials we've been given that Mr. Parkinson is going to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012529",
