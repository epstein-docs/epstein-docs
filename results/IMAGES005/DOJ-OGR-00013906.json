How many properties did Jeffrey Epstein own when you started working in the office?\n2 A. When I started working, he had already owned Zorro Ranch, 9 East 71st Street, and El Brillo, I believe.\n3 Q. You mentioned Zorro Ranch, where was that?\n4 A. That was in New Mexico.\n5 Q. 9 East 71st Street was where?\n6 A. New York.\n7 Q. And El Brillo was where?\n8 A. Florida.\n9 Q. Did there come a time when he acquired any additional properties while you were there?\n10 A. Yes. I believe he acquired a Paris apartment, and he also purchased the island, St. Thomas.\n11 Q. Do you remember the name of the island?\n12 A. It was Little Saint James, but the name was changed to Little Saint Jeffs.\n13 Q. Was that purchased, the island, at the time you were there?\n14 A. Yes. I would say probably the middle of my time there, it was purchased, and it was a humongous project.\n15 Q. Please describe, if you could, just that particular project of getting the island ready, what was involved in that and what roles did you and Ghislaine perform?\n16 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.
