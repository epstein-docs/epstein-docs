POMERANTZ: Your Honor, just to clarify, I don't think that's an accurate representation as to Detective Byrne.\nAnd I, again, would note that the very capable tech folks were here working and troubleshooting the issue. And I understand the decision not to call Mr. Hamilton was not with the technological issues, but instead a decision that defense counsel has made.\nMS. STERNHEIM: We could go on all day, Judge, but suffice it to say, we're not calling Mr. Hamilton.\nTHE COURT: You're not calling Mr. Hamilton and you have no additional application regarding being able to call him remotely with public access at the same time. Your concern is there would be a limitation of public access during his testimony, and for that reason, you've decided -- well, that's the case, and you've decided not to call him.\nMS. STERNHEIM: That is correct. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: All right. Thank you. Anything else?\nMS. COMEY: Your Honor, just in terms of timing, there is one brief piece of evidence that we may seek to introduce as rebuttal evidence. I think it would take 10 minutes, at most, to get in. We just need to know whether we should have those witnesses - who are basically custodians - available at the end of today or if they should be available Monday.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
