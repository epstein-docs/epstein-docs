STERNHEIM: Yes.\n3 THE COURT: Okay.\n4 MS. MENNINGER: May I inquire, your Honor? In some\n5 courtrooms I've been in there is a rule, perhaps not strongly\n6 enforced, but strongly suggested, that the government only\n7 reserve a certain portion of their summation for the rebuttal\n8 piece because otherwise it ends up being a bit of a more in\n9 rebuttal than in the actual substance. I don't know if your\n10 Honor has that practice, but I would request that some\n11 reasonable percentage be allocated to the first versus the\n12 rebuttal portion.\n13 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I expect the rebuttal will be\n14 significantly shorter than the closing. I don't think that's\n15 going to be an issue.\n16 THE COURT: Well, it certainly should be. It should\n17 be rebuttal and not --\n18 MS. COMEY: That's exactly right, your Honor. And\n19 I'll be doing the rebuttal. I fully intend it to be much\n20 shorter than the closing and to the point, as is consistent\n21 with our office practice before your Honor and in this\n22 district.\n23 THE COURT: Okay. Anything else on that?\n24 Let me just check my various inputs to see if I'm\n25 missing -- check with my law clerk.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00014103",
