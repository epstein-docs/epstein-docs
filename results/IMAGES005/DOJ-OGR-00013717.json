Matters to take up, counsel?\nMS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, just briefly from the government, my not amazing math skills, but I note that I think that the witness who's been on cross examination now for about the same amount of time that she was on direct examination, it would be helpful for scheduling purposes to know when we can expect to have the next witness ready.\nMS. MENNINGER: I don't know, your Honor. An hour.\nMS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.\nAnd the other question, I just -- rather not a question, just one thing I wanted to flag. I believe that, on cross examination, the witness was asked some questions about hindsight bias, which I expect to be a subject of expert testimony, and this witness, as she testified earlier on direct examination, is a psychologist. I'm not saying that there is anything to take up at this moment, but before she had taken the stand and the parties had conferred, we were asked that she wasn't going to be -- we were asked by Ms. Menninger to make sure that she wasn't going to be testifying about things in that area.\nSo I just wanted to flag that she is testifying as a lay witness and that she shouldn't be asked questions on cross examination that would be the subject of expert testimony.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
