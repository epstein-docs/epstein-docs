MOE: So with respect to the Rule 408 issue, defense counsel has provided the government this morning just before the Court day with a few documents they've marked as exhibits. THE COURT: One moment. Go ahead. MS. MOE: Those two documents are correspondence between Jane's attorney and the victim compensation fund, as well as correspondence from Jane's attorney and Ms. Menninger's law firm. To the extent defense counsel intends to offer these as exhibits, there's a Rule 408 issue here. MS. MENNINGER: I don't, your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. MS. MOE: I just want to ensure any questions about this are framed as Jane's knowledge about the litigation and not asking for her to testify about documents that aren't in evidence, that she may not have seen, that are prepared by attorneys. In order to avoid confusion, we want to make sure that any questions about civil litigation are about what she knows or doesn't know. I want to avoid a scenario in which a lay witness is shown legal documents and asked to read them into the record or testify to them beyond the scope of her knowledge.
