Why isn't it applicable with respect to what the defense has put in issue with regard to that?\n2\n3\n4 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. The witnesses themselves -- sorry, your Honor. One moment.\n5\n6 THE COURT: Yes.\n7\n8 MR. PAGLIUCA: If you don't mind, your Honor, it's easier for me --\n9\n10 THE COURT: Since it's Saturday, I will break my one-lawyer-per-issue rule.\n11\n12 MR. PAGLIUCA: I appreciate it. My recollection is the testimony from each of the four witnesses, I will call them, is that they said that they told Ms. Maxwell their age.\n13 Carolyn said that she told Ms. Maxwell her age. Jane said she told Ms. Maxwell her age. Similarly, Kate said she told Ms. Maxwell her age.\n14\n15 So there is no \"I'm not trying to find out what her age is\" evidence in this case. The evidence that was elicited -- I think this is, you know, largely through Mr. Alessi. Mr. Alessi said that he only saw two people at the house that he thought were under the age of 18, and that was Ms. Roberts and Jane. I'm trying to remember everybody's names.\n16\n17 So that's that testimony.\n18\n19 I don't think there's any other testimony in the\n20\n21 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
