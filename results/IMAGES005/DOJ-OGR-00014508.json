Jane told about a woman named Sophie. She gave a description. She was blond and pretty. She said Sophie married a racecar driver and Sophie joined in these sexual massages. And then she told the government about a woman named Eva, correct, she did not use a last name, but Eva. And this wasn't just some disconnected Eva that showed up in an address book from some unknown time in the future, Jane said that Eva joined in with Sophie. She joined in with Sophie. Those were your words, yes, Eva joined in with Sophie. So where would Jane have gotten these names, Sophie and Eva, if the massage didn't really happen and she was trying to come up with some names? Well, let's look. Sure enough, on her very first flight log entry that has her name on it from November of 1996, she's on a flight with Sophie and Eva. What are the odds that the very first flight she takes is with two women who she claims are on a group sexualized massage? Let's look at Eva. Eva is flying with her child and her nanny. She told you on the stand that she just had a baby. Do you think that Dr. Eva Dubin that you just saw on the stand with a child and a nanny who's on a flight with Sophie, she joined in with Sophie was in a group sexualized massage. Eva told you she knows Sophie. Sophie was a professional masseuse. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014508",
