Can you tell retrospectively whether someone who was abused\n3 was also groomed?\n4 A. Sure. Yeah. On the individual level, for example, when\n5 I'm providing treatment and I'm talking with someone who's been\n6 abused, we'll be talking about how that abuse came to be. And\n7 often they'll be talking about the development of the\n8 relationship and how they felt about this person and how it\n9 unfolded over time.\n10 And then we've also done scientific research that's\n11 been done to also identify retrospectively the grooming\n12 process.\n13 Q. Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.\n14 A. Sure. So there's a lot of research that's been done, for\n15 example, with victims, talking with them about what their\n16 experiences have been in terms of the childhood sexual abuse\n17 that they've experienced. And that's with both people who are\n18 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking\n19 about it when they are adults. So there's what -- that would\n20 be called kind of the victim literature.\n21 But then there are also a number of professionals who\n22 do research and work with the offenders. And they do research\n23 talking with offenders about what sorts of behaviors they\n24 engage in in order to lure and recruit and entrap children in\n25 these sexually abusive circumstances.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
