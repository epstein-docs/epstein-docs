You saw the\n2    witnesses yourself. They were not talking about one time that\n3    they saw a fake car crash. They were telling you about how\n4    they were sexually abused again and again and again.

Again and again at\n13   this trial you saw the lengths the defense went to in order to\n14   try to discredit the witnesses, because their testimony was\n15   devastating evidence of Maxwell's guilt.\n16   I want to talk about that for just a moment. Let's\n17   talk about just two examples.\n18   Remember that in a cross-examination of Jane, when the\n19   defense repeatedly tried to suggest that Jane had said on her\n20   application to Interlochen that nothing was difficult for her?\n21   This is Defense Exhibit J-3. This went on for question after\n22   question, as the defense tried to suggest that Jane was lying\n23   about her difficult home life. Here it is.
