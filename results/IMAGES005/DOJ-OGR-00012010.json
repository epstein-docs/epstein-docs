We have previously reached out to defense to ask to confer about some of these issues. We would like to do that this evening. I am concerned that there may be topics that are identifying as to this victim and we would be happy to talk it through with defense counsel and work out a solution about anonymizing names or other issues as we continued all along in this case. So we ask the Court to direct the parties to meet and confer on that issue given the steaks of that issue in this case.\nTHE COURT: Ms. Menninger, the witness is on cross, so they can't confer with the witness. Any reason not to do that?\nMS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I see no reason not to confer with the government about a way that we can accommodate this.\nTHE COURT: You can do that. If you have different views, you'll raise them with me by letter tonight if you come to a point of disagreement. Okay?\nMS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.\nMS. MENNINGER: Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Anything else?\nMS. MENNINGER: Not from us, your Honor. Thank you.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
