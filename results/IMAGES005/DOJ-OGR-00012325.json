I believe we're up to the third stage. 2 A. Okay. So once the perpetrator has access to the child, the 3 next thing that they typically do is engage in a series of 4 deceptive and coercive manipulative behaviors in order to build 5 a relationship of trust, attachment, and dependency. So they 6 will exploit whatever vulnerabilities they've identified in the 7 child, and then put themselves in a position to meet those 8 unmet needs. 9 10 And that can involve anything from spending time with 11 the child; giving the child special attention; letting the 12 child know that they're unique or special in some way; creating 13 a false sense of family, you know, I'm somebody you can trust, 14 I'm somebody you can rely on; gift giving, sometimes using 15 money or exposing them to things that they wouldn't otherwise 16 have access to. And that generally both increases the 17 likelihood that the child is going to become attached and 18 connected with the perpetrator, but also it increases the 19 perpetrator's power and control over the victim. 20 Q. Dr. Rocchio, you mentioned gift-giving. Based on your 21 experience, research, and training, what role can gift-giving 22 play in building a relationship between a child and a 23 perpetrator? 24 A. Gift-giving can certainly be a very powerful inducement and 25 lure in the context of a relationship. Again, especially to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012325",
