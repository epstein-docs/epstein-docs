  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 89 of 257 2923 LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger Epstein's house. She told you it was other people in Epstein's office. And Ghislaine didn't encourage Jane to travel with Epstein. You heard not one single word out of Jane's mouth that Ghislaine encouraged or enticed her to travel anywhere. The government's biggest promise that they repeated to you over and over again with respect to Jane is that she was, quote, sometimes in the room when it happened. But when Jane got on the stand, she admitted, finally, that what she told the government several times is she wasn't sure and had no recollection that Ghislaine was ever in the room when Epstein abused her. She said it in February 2020, and what she said on the stand in front of you is, as you sit here today, you're not sure whether you were ever in the room alone with Ghislaine and Epstein, correct, and she said, no. The government also promised you an array of witnesses, another promise they broke. They said these witnesses would back up the accusers' claims. They told you, for example, that there were relatives from the victims that you would hear from, and that those relatives would tell you about the victims spending time with the defendant and Epstein and traveling with them and receiving phone calls from them all when they were between the ages of 14 and 17. Let's break that down. What relatives came to tell you about Jane spending time with the defendant and Epstein? What relative was that? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
