THE COURT: Agreed. MS. STERNHEIM: So the form itself is one thing, the content is something else THE COURT: I agree. MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you. THE COURT: I think the only potential for -- and you'll look at the Lieberman case, too, is if there is testimony that the employer did something to verify the information on the form. So, for example, if the form says this is my address and the testimony is that when an employee fills out this form, we look at their driver's license to verify that the address is the same, then, as a business, I think, under Lieberman, that comes in. It would have to be something comparable for verification of children -- I think it's children and spouse? MS. STERNHEIM: Correct. THE COURT: In order for this to fit for the content of the form. It's content versus the form itself. It's precisely the line that the circuit draws in Lieberman. MS. STERNHEIM: But in addition, Judge, this witness does not have any personal knowledge as to what the procedures were seven years prior to her becoming employed. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
