There is no significant or motivating purpose of a return trip where Mr. Epstein wasn't present; it's just a return trip from New Mexico. That would not be a significant or motivating purpose. She is just presumably going home, but is not for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity. The testimony, if we are to believe it, is that she went to New Mexico for some purpose to engage in sexual activity, that's if you believe Jane's testimony. But returning from there is not that purpose. Returning is returning, or it's going somewhere else; it's going somewhere away from where -- at least in the record, the evidence in the record, if there is any -- Epstein was presumably in New Mexico. This is her leaving New Mexico. So I don't think that qualifies as a significant or motivating purpose. That travel across state lines is for some other purpose. MS. MOE: Your Honor, I don't believe this note is that clear about what flight we're talking about. The note begins by talking about an unspecified return flight, and then it turns to talking about a flight to New Mexico. Then there's a modifying clause about intent. It is unclear which of the two flights we are now modifying. I think the safest course here is to refer the jury to the elements of the crime. I think guessing at what flight they may be talking about is sort of beyond the reach of this SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014698",
