You were asked some questions on cross-examination about your applications for admission to Interlochen. Do you remember those questions? A. Yes. Q. I'd like to just ask you a few questions about those particular applications. A. Okay. MS. MOE: If I could just have a moment, I'm going to grab a copy of them. Your Honor, I'd ask for permission for the witness and the jurors to view Defendant's Exhibit J-3 which I believe is in evidence under seal. THE COURT: Let me just verify. Yes. MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. May the jurors turn to that in their binders? Ms. Menninger, without objection? MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: Jurors, you may pick up your binder and turn to J-3, correct? Q. Jane, do you have that up in front of you? A. Yes. Q. Just to be clear, what we're talking about is Defendant's Exhibit J-3, your application for admission to Interlochen for the summer of 1994? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
