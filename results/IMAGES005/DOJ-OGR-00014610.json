  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 210 of 257 3044 LCKVMAX8 Charge herself. Accordingly, you may find Ms. Maxwell guilty of the offenses charged in Counts Two, Four, and Six if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the government has proven that another person actually committed the offense with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, and that Ms. Maxwell aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, or procured that person to commit the crime. As you can see, the first requirement is that another person has committed the crime charged. Obviously, no one can be convicted of aided and abetting the criminal acts of another if no crime was committed by the other person. But if you find that a crime was committed, then you must consider whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abetted the commission of the crime. To aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is necessary that the government prove that the defendant willfully and knowingly associated herself in some way with the crime committed by the other person, and willfully and knowingly sought by some act to help commit the crime succeed. However, let me caution you that the mere presence of the defendant where a crime is being committed, even coupled with knowledge by the defendant that a crime is being committed, or the mere acquiescence by a defendant in the criminal conduct of others, even with guilty knowledge, is not sufficient to make the defendant guilty under this approach of aiding and abetting. Such a defendant would be guilty under SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014610",
