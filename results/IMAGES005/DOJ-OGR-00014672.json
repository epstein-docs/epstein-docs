Do you have a proposal for how to say that other than just yes? I'm happy to hear it. MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, my proposal is to give them the limiting instructions that we got before. THE COURT: The limiting instruction is nonresponsive to their question. MR. EVERDELL: One moment, your Honor. THE COURT: They are not asking what it may not be used for. They have a specific question, I think, probably in light of the limiting instruction as to whether they may consider it for this. And the substantive answer to that is yes. MR. EVERDELL: One moment, your Honor. (Counsel conferred) MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think, as you're saying, to say yes, while technically accurate, allows the jury to then use her testimony more broadly if they aren't given the instruction of how they can use the testimony. So if the simple answer is yes, then the concern is that they would use it and apply the testimony more broadly. And so I think what was given before with the limits in the limiting instruction is how they can use it appropriately in testimony and should be given again. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
