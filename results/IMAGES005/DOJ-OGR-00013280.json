ROHRBACH: A couple matters from the government, your Honor.\n3 THE COURT: Yes.\n4 MR. ROHRBACH: First, we just wanted to confirm, as per our discussion at the end of the day yesterday, that whether or not the defense is planning to recall Jane and whether they are releasing Brian from subpoena.\n5 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I had understood that there was going to be a conversation with Jane about the conversations she had with her brother, and that would be disclosed to us. I didn't receive that last night. I think we need to know whether there is not truth telling going on in the recounting of this event.\n6 THE COURT: And that's with respect to recalling Jane, not with respect to subpoenaing Brian; correct?\n7 MS. MENNINGER: It could be with respect to either one. We already have Brian under subpoena, your Honor. With respect to the calling of Jane, I would like to know that before we make a decision.\n8 THE COURT: I did ask yesterday if you had prevailed on your motion not to exclude Brian, would you subpoena him and you said no. I realize you didn't prevail nor did you -- not prevail, the government withdrew him, but is your position now\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00013280",
