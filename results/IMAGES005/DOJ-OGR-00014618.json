Willfully and Knowingly. An act it is done knowingly and willfully if it's done deliberately and purposefully. That is, Ms. Maxwell's actions must have been her conscious objective rather than a product of a mistake or accident, mere negligence or some other innocent reason. To satisfy its burden of proof that Ms. Maxwell willfully and knowingly became a member of a conspiracy to accomplish an unlawful purpose, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt Ms. Maxwell knew that she was a member of an operation or conspiracy to accomplish that unlawful purpose and that her action of joining such an operation or conspiracy was not due to carelessness, negligence, or mistake. Now, as I've said, knowledge is a matter of inference from the proven facts. Science has not yet devised a manner of looking into a person's mind and knowing what that person is thinking. However, you do have before you the evidence of certain acts of conversations alleged to have taken place involving Ms. Maxwell or in her presence. You may consider SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
