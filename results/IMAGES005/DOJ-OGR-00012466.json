COMEY: Your Honor, we're not offering the\n8 entirety of 52. As I believe we mentioned to your Honor in\n9 briefing, we're trying to narrow what we're offering from this\n10 exhibit, and so we picked five pages that are particularly\n11 relevant to the facts that are at issue in this case, and we\n12 would only propose to show the jury those five pages, which is\n13 why we're going through this process.\n14 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't have a problem with that, your\n15 Honor, but I think what I would say is they would offer 52 and,\n16 in essence, it's a redacted version of 52 that's going to the\n17 jury. So the record will be clear that 52, if the Court is\n18 going to allow it, is authenticated and admitted, and that it's\n19 a redacted version of 52 is what's going to the jury.\n20 THE COURT: That sounds exactly right.\n21 MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor.\n22 THE COURT: So it's 52A through what?\n23 MS.
