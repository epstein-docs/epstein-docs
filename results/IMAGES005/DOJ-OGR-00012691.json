And that was what I ruled before about 9 those, which is why you can lay the foundation through Maguire, 10 and if it's temporally tied back, I imagine I would admit it, 11 depending on that testimony; same theory here. 12 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. 13 MS. COMEY: Understood, your Honor. Thank you. 14 THE COURT: All right. 15 Are these for me or for the witness? 16 MR. EVERDELL: Those are for you, your Honor. 17 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. 18 MR. EVERDELL: It should be three, for the next three 19 witnesses. Sorry I couldn't get one for your Honor's deputy. 20 THE COURT: All right. So we can bring the witness 21 back and we can get the jury. 22 THE WITNESS: Good afternoon, your Honor. 23 THE COURT: Good afternoon, Mr. Parkinson. You may 24 take your seat. Thank you. 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012691",
