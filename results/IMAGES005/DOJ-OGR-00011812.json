The best way to describe it, it was kind of like a recreational vehicle inside; it wasn't like a typical airliner would look.\nYou went in the front entrance door which is located at the forward part of the aircraft. You walked upstairs. And if you continued straight ahead, it went into the first bathroom, which we considered the crew bathroom; so there was a lavatory up in front.

It was a full decked-out kitchen.\nAnd then once you went further past the kitchen, there was what we call the round room.
