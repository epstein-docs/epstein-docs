I had told my mom that I was not raped and I didn't want to talk about it. Q. When did this conversation happen? A. This was shortly after I returned from the trip from Thailand and Vietnam, so late summer of 1996. Q. If I could just ask you to speak into the microphone. A. Yeah. Sorry. Late summer of 1996. Q. Thank you. Who else, if anyone, did you tell what had happened to you with Maxwell and Epstein? A. Later in that fall, I started dating someone named Dave Mulligan. And I talked to him at some point a little bit about what had happened at the ranch. Q. When did you meet Dave? A. I met him at prom, actually, my junior year; so earlier in the spring of 1996. Q. And when did you start dating him? A. In that fall, I think maybe September/October. Q. And did you tell Dave about what had happened with Maxwell and Epstein? A. I did. Q. Did there come a time when you spoke with members of the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013659",
