POMERANTZ: That question seems fine, your Honor.\n3 I think the government agrees with your Honor that the\n4 other questions were beyond the scope.\n5 MR. PAGLIUCA: May I? As long as we're on this topic,\n6 your Honor. I would like to preview another area from this\n7 article that I think is within this, but I want to make sure\n8 that the Court agrees with me before I go down this road.\n9 THE COURT: Go ahead.\n10 MR. PAGLIUCA: The article that we're talking about\n11 which is at 3502-018, the government's disclosure, the study\n12 that was done in this particular article, and which I believe\n13 this is the basis for her testimony about this grooming the\n14 environment, and so the study that she is referring to\n15 factually, there were 395 undergraduate students at John Jay\n16 College here who were given the five vignettes, I will call\n17 them, of this grooming behavior and asked in a sixth vignette\n18 which was non-grooming behavior, and they were asked to predict\n19 prospectively whether or not that was grooming behavior, and\n20 they couldn't. And the conclusion of the study was the five\n21 factors that she was talking about cannot be used to\n22 prospectively predict grooming behavior. And I would like to\n23 bring out those facts on cross-examination.\n24 THE COURT: Sure. I mean, that's consistent with her\n25 testimony.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00012367",
