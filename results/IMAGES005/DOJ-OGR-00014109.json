MENNINGER: Well, a letter from a third party. That person also was under our subpoena. I don't know if your Honor views that as sufficient record on a Fifth Amendment assertion. We have not released the person from their subpoena. It wasn't styled as a motion to quash. So I'm a little bit unsure. Otherwise, we would like that witness to testify, as well. So, if your Honor deems it necessary to have a further record on it or a formal pleading from that witness, the witness is represented by counsel, Compton counsel, a former AUSA. So I don't know what their intentions are with regard to their client testifying beyond what the Court received in that letter. THE COURT: As I said yesterday, I don't have an application. And I asked if you have an application. MS. MENNINGER: I don't. THE COURT: And now the application is, Judge, tell me what you think we should do. MS. MENNINGER: No, it would be similar. We have a valid subpoena on the person and I would ask to enforce the subpoena and have the witness come testify. And if -- THE COURT: Have you communicated with counsel as to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
