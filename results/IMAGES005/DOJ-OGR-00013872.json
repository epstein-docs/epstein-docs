EVERDELL: Your Honor, the records show that the O'Neills owned that property until 1997, some family of the O'Neills, not Ms. Maxwell. THE COURT: They don't rent places in London? MR. EVERDELL: That's something that the government, I'm sure, could argue to the jury. But this is extremely relevant. We're equally able to argue to the jury that this shows that she owned it, and what Kate is testifying to couldn't have happened because -- THE COURT: Well, again, it shows ownership. I get that. The relevant question is residence. The government has testimony from Ms. Maxwell that she lived there beginning in 1992. What evidence do you have as to whether or not she lived there prior to ownership? MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if I may have a moment. THE COURT: You may. (Counsel conferred with defendant) MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think the solution to this problem -- and this would not be a mini trial -- is for us to be able to admit the records showing the ownership records. And if the government wants to admit the testimony to be able to argue the opposite point, then okay. But that's hardly a mini trial. And then each side gets to argue their point.
