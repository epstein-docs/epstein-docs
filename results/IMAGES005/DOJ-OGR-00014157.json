COMEY: So then to be clear, your Honor, is it the case that Agent Young is only being called for prior inconsistent statements?\n2 MR. EVERDELL: Maybe we need to confer a little bit before this.\n3 THE COURT: Okay. Who's the first witness?\n4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Jason Richards, your Honor, Special Agent Richards, which is a short witness.\n5 MS. COMEY: That's another witness we offered to stipulate to, your Honor. Prior inconsistent statements, I think there are two that he's going to be called to testify --\n6 THE COURT: That he's just doing those, Mr. Pagliuca, or anything else?\n7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Excuse me, your Honor?\n8 THE COURT: I'm sorry.\n9 Is he just doing those two --\n10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, that's it.\n11 THE COURT: Okay. And then who's after that?\n12 MR. EVERDELL: Well, it would have been Young, Agent Young.\n13 THE COURT: Okay.\n14 MR. EVERDELL: And then it's -- we have Eva Dubin.\n15 THE COURT: Okay.\n16 Why don't we do Richards and then Dubin, and see if you can stipulate on Young.
