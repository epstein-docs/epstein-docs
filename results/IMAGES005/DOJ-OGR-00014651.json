MODE: No, your Honor. 5 MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor. 6 THE COURT: Two things. One, I will indicate the 7 alternate jurors, I will tell them they will not take part in 8 the deliberations, but they are not excused and they are under 9 my rules until they hear from Ms. Williams. I'm going to put 10 extra emphasis on that because we're in a pandemic and we might 11 need a juror to return. I'll could say what I normally say, 12 but just say this could happen. 13 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, are you requiring that they be 14 here or just on call? 15 THE COURT: I mean, I've always just done on call, but 16 I'm happy to take a suggestion otherwise. 17 MR. PAGLIUCA: There is no need for them to stay here. 18 MS. STERNHEIM: That's fine. 19 THE COURT: We'll bring them in if we need to. 20 Just so everybody agrees, the alternates are 125, 149, 21 151, 152, and 170. 22 MS. STERNHEIM: We're all too tired. That's right. 23 THE COURT: I'm going to tell the jurors, I just want 24 to make sure everybody agrees with the wording, you may 25 deliberate as long this evening as you all agree to.
