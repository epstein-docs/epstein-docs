Those all came in by stipulation on Friday. They'll say that Maxwell didn't live at 44 Kinnerton Street in 1994, when Kate met her; and that she lived -- that Maxwell lived in another house nearby in London. But that's just another distraction and here's why:\n\nMaxwell herself testified under oath in a 2019 deposition, here it is, that she had lived at 44 Kinnerton Street since 1992 or 1993. So either the defendant lived there the whole time or she mixed up her two London houses and Kate did too. Either way, it just doesn't matter.\n\nSo next, the defense has argued to you that Jane and Kate and Carolyn and Annie are all lying. The defense has asked you to believe that Jane and Kate and Annie and Carolyn, that they are all lying for money. But none of that makes any sense when you look at it closely. It doesn't make any sense when you look at the evidence.\n\nNow, all four women have testified that they submitted claims to the Jeffrey Epstein Victim Compensation Program. They were awarded millions of dollars. And that happened well before this trial. Their civil lawsuits are over. Those cases are done and the witnesses don't get anything out of testifying at this trial. They were clear in their testimony. They have no financial stake in the outcome of this trial. None.\n\nAnd one of the other ways you know the witnesses\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00014473",
