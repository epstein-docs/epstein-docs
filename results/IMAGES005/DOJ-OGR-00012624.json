In 2005, what was your title at the Palm Beach Police Department? 5 6 A. I was the crime scene manager and a sworn police officer. 7 Q. Could you briefly explain what it is to be a crime scene manager? 8 9 A. The job that I had, the responsibilities, was to oversee the operation of the fingerprint bureau, with a fingerprint expert. It was also to oversee the photography and video work that was done, both in-car, in camera, and the still photos that were taken on various crime scenes, not necessarily ones I worked but ones that either patrol processed or people under me processed. And also I was in charge of the evidence unit, the evidence department. And we had regular inspections. We were an accredited agency and under CALEA. And we did follow the rules on that, and we were checked quite frequently on those rules. 20 Q. Thank you, Mr. Parkinson. 21 I'd like to direct your attention to October 20, 2005. 22 What, if any, search did you participate in that day? 23 A. I participated in a search of a residence at 358 El Brillo 24 which is a street in the town of Palm Beach. 25 MS. COMEY: Ms. Drescher, could we please pull up for SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
