ROHRBACH: Your Honor, as I think our letter\n4 indicated, we're quite surprised to receive the defendant's --\n5 THE COURT: Mr. Rohrbach, let's just get to the issue.\n6 It sounds like it's narrowed to two things. Every letter I\n7 get, it starts with, We're so surprised or this has already\n8 been litigated. Let's just get to the issue.\n9 MR. ROHRBACH: So, your Honor, I think we're in a\n10 pretty good place then. Mr. Flatley is not going to go into\n11 very much -- we obviously don't know exactly what Mr. Flatley\n12 will say on the stand, but the questions and what we expect to\n13 elicit should track the government's November 26 letter. And\n14 so it sounds like if defense counsel doesn't have a problem\n15 with what's in this letter, then there is no issue here for the\n16 Court.\n17 I'm not exactly sure what Ms. Menninger is referencing\n18 with regard to CDs, but I think that we expect Mr. Flatley to\n19 give purely fact testimony regarding CDs, and there's no expert\n20 opinion at all involved there. To the extent that it's a late\n21 disclosure of anything, it's just a factual view of Mr. Flatley\n22 that is in the 3500 material that he may testify to.\n23 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, on the CDs, apparently\n24 Mr. Flatley intends to testify that a created date is the same\n25 thing as a modified date.
