We're looking at the left-hand side of the closet at numerous black binders that were found on a shelf with homemade labels on the spine of the binders. Q. I'll just ask you a few more questions about that. MS. MOE: Could we just leave that up and pull up alongside it Government Exhibit 925. And again, just for the witness, counsel, and the Court. Q. What is Government Exhibit 925? A. This is just another photograph of the same binders. This is just a closer photograph. Q. And do Government Exhibits 914 and 925 fairly and accurately depict the binders as you found them on the day of the search? A. Yes, ma'am. MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government offers Government Exhibits 914, 925, and 925-R. MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, just one moment. THE COURT: Yes. (Counsel conferred) MS. MOE: Your Honor, after conferring with counsel, we'd withdraw that application and we'd respectfully request that Government Exhibits 925 and 925-R be admitted. MR. EVERDELL: No objection, your Honor. THE COURT: So not 914. MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012965",
