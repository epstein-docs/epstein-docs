We'll see you tomorrow.\n2 (Jury not present)\n3 THE COURT: Everyone may be seated.\n4 Okay. Matters to take up?\n5 MS. MOE: Your Honor, we just wanted to provide the Court with an update on timing. We anticipate that we may rest tomorrow or, if things run long, on Friday morning.\n6 THE COURT: Okay. Does the defense anticipate moving to a defense case after the close of the government's case?\n7 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we do have witnesses. I think we haven't had the chance to confer with the government yet, but I think it might make sense, especially if we finish on Thursday potentially, to have the charge conference on Friday so we can have time to fully address it.\n8 THE COURT: I'll need you to pull up the mic.\n9 MR. EVERDELL: We will likely have an application at the end of the government's case, as is typical for the defense. And we'd want the chance to be heard on that as well.\n10 THE COURT: So my thinking had been the charge conference either the evening of the 16th or, if the parties were interested in taking me up on Saturday the 18th. So I suppose it depends if you're saying there is -- you won't be -- well, I would prefer, given just timing of when I'm going to be able to get you the charge, to not do it Friday, unless you don't have a case to put on on Friday.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
