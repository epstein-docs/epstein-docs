Is there the possibility of retrieval from an internal source, meaning within the individual who is trying to recreate the memory?\n3 A. Well, in the example that I gave earlier with the stop sign and the yield sign, we do suggest the misinformation externally, we supply them with the misinformation. But sometimes what happens with individuals is they draw inferences about what might have happened or what could have happened or what possibly happened and they can suggest things to themselves. That's called autosuggestion where there is not somebody deliberately suggesting something to you, not deliberately trying to tell you, you know, I saw the thief and he was wearing a brown jacket instead of a green jacket, but you, the witness, are drawing inferences that then start to feel as if they're memories.\n17 Q. Going back to the acquisition stage, what would affect the quality of one's acquisition of an event?\n18 A. At the time of acquisition, the event itself, well, some obvious thing, how good is the lighting, how far away are you, how distracted are you, are you preoccupied thinking about something else. Sometimes, if you're under the influence of certain drugs. Marijuana is one that has been studied a lot, for example, and we've studied it in a recent paper. That could affect the formation of the memory in the first place.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013983",
