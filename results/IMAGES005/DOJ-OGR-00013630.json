It was -- it was a little weird; one of those things that is hard to explain. We were sitting next to each other, and he put out his hand for me to hold, and we were holding hands. Not weird. Normal. Fine. Then he kind of caressed, rubbed my arm and shoe, foot. It was one of those things that just gave me a weird feeling, but wasn't that weird and probably normal. The one thing that kind of weirded me out about it was he let go of my hand when he was talking to Maria. Oh, well, I decided it was no big deal. It just made me mad because he's being so amazing, paying for a summer program for me and helping me with college. He's so nice and so generous with everyone. I just didn't want to have any weird feelings about it. I didn't/couldn't say anything to Maria about it because she worships him and it would just create problems. I couldn't tell anyone else because it is not a big deal and I didn't want to portray him in a bad light. I really don't think it is a big deal. I think he is just a relaxed guy and likes to flirt or was being fatherly or something. I know this sounds like me trying to justify him doing something weird, but it isn't. Continue reading? Q. Let me just pause you right there. Can you explain how you were feeling about Epstein at the time you were writing about him in your journal? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
