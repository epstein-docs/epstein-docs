MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we've conferred with the government on the matter of the limiting instruction, and, well, I think this is a case where the cure is worse than the disease. So, although we maintain our objection, I think a limiting instruction wouldn't be productive, from our standpoint, as just highlighted, so we are going to withdraw our request for the limiting instruction. THE COURT: Okay. For the record, what was the proposed limiting instruction? MS. COMEY: As to the video, we proposed: \"The video you are watching contains a depiction of a very young minor. You should not infer from this photo that Mr. Epstein had a sexual attraction to minors as young as the girl depicted in that photo. You also may not consider this evidence as any kind of reflection on Ms. Maxwell's character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the indictment. However, to the extent you conclude that the evidence is relevant to the issues before you, you can consider it.\" And the limiting instruction as to Government Exhibit 250, the photo, was as follows: \"You are about to see a photo SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
