Please be seated.\n4 I did receive your note asking to finish today at 5,\n5 so I brought you in to dismiss you.\n6 A few things.\n7 Of course, bear all of my instructions in mind.\n8 Please continue to take precautions in light of the increase in\n9 the variant. I need all of you here and healthy, of course.\n10 So take your masks, be cautious. I appreciate that.\n11 You'll begin again tomorrow at 9 a.m. Same\n12 instructions: Wait till everyone is there, then begin your\n13 deliberations.\n14 If deliberations are not complete starting tomorrow, I\n15 would like you to make yourselves available to deliberate until at\n16 least 6 p.m. Of course, if you all agree to deliberate\n17 later than that, you're most welcome to do so. Please just let\n18 me know by note when you wish to stop. But I'd like you to\n19 plan to deliberate until at least 6 p.m.\n20 As with the last time, if that is a hardship that you\n21 can't do, let Ms. Williams know that on your way out and we'll\n22 adjust. But otherwise, please plan for 6 p.m. Of course, by\n23 this I don't mean to pressure you in any way. You should take\n24 all the time that you need.\n25 With that, I bid you a good night.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00014714",
