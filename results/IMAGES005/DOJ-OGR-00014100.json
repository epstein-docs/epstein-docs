I'll be with Ms. Menninger until 7:30. At 8 o'clock. 4 THE COURT: All right. So by 8 o'clock. So if there is, and that requires briefing, when will I get your brief, Mr. Pagliuca? 7 MR. PAGLIUCA: 8:05, your Honor. 8 THE COURT: It's in the can. Glad to hear it. I don't know if you are joking, actually. 10 MR. PAGLIUCA: No, I'm not joking, your Honor. 8:05 is when you will get it. 12 THE COURT: Good deal. I like it. Okay. A couple other odds and ends. 14 I got a letter yesterday from counsel for a potential defense witness. As far as I could tell, there was no application in the letter. I don't know if anyone has an application. 18 MS. COMEY: I don't believe there's any application from that witness or from the government with respect to that witness, your Honor. 21 MS. MENNINGER: We don't have it, your Honor. I don't know what you're talking about. 23 THE COURT: One of you was cc'd on it. 24 MS. COMEY: I believe Ms. Menninger was cc'd on it. May I confer? 26 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014100",
