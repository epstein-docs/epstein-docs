THE COURT: Those came in redacted? MS. MOE: Yes, completely redacted without any content. MS. MENNINGER: Judge, it came in the testimony. The emails themselves were redacted. The content was part of the testimony. THE COURT: I think that's right. MS. MOE: I don't believe the emails -- were offered, were offered for the truth. That's one of the reasons we wanted to check the transcript. THE COURT: The curative instruction that you're asking for is in the charge, precisely the words that you just indicated, that it's, what's in evidence and not counsel's arguments. The jury is going to get that. It's in the charge. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Our concern was that there were a number of items throughout the closing that were mischaracterizations of testimony or inaccurate or references to items that were not in evidence. That's why we're requesting it now, although I understand the Court's point that the jury will be charged this afternoon and that language is in the charge. The second issue that we wanted to raise is, as the Court will recall from pretrial litigation, we moved to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014558",
