MENNINGER: Right. That's right. THE COURT: So it will be a flash drive and the physical exhibits and that's it. And you've gotten that, the flash drive. Everybody's locked at it so you can confirm you know what's going back? MR. ROHRBACH: The parties agreed on what should be on the flash drive and it's been created. I don't think the defense has had an opportunity to look at it yet. THE COURT: Who's handling this, Ms. Menninger? MR. EVERDELL: I will be handling it, your Honor. THE COURT: Let's be ready again at the lunch break to just confirm on the record that that's ready to go. Let me check if I have anything else. I don't think so. The box is turned. Okay. All right. We'll wait for our jurors and let my staff know if you need me for anything before we get underway. (Recess) (Continued on next page) SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
