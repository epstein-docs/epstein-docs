There is no -- there is lots of things that you might expect to be part of the case that are not here. The main reason for that is that the age of the case, especially the allegations in the 1990s are quite old and these records don't exist anymore. So I think it's fair to raise to the agent the absence of evidence, that evidence through the agent. That's one topic.\nTHE COURT: So, for example, give me your example on emails.\nMR. EVERDELL: It's in here somewhere, your Honor. As part of your investigating the case, you tried to gather as much documentary evidence as you can to corroborate what the witnesses are telling you, isn't that right. I imagine the answer is going to be yes to that. And given the age of the case, there were no emails from the 1990s, there are allegations in this case from the 1990s, correct, yeah. There are no emails that you have for any of the accusing witnesses who testified against Ms. Maxwell from the 1990s, is that right, yes. Because, in fact, in the 1990s, nobody used email, it wasn't very popular, it was just starting, yes. So because the allegations are over 25 years old, there are no emails in this case from that period, isn't that right, yes, there is no emails. Same thing about phone --\nTHE COURT: I'm sorry. I cut you off, Mr. Everdell. Same thing about phone records?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00014138",
