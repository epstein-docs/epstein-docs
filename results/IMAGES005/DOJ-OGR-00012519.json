We saw that on the floor plans yesterday. In that hallway on the wall is where that picture of the girl who's exposing her bottom is hanging on the wall. So obviously it's before they took the picture down and before they logged that piece of evidence because it's in the initial walk-through. So you see the photo quite prominently on the wall as the video goes through the hallway towards the master bedroom. Given that your Honor has excluded that piece of evidence, the photograph of that photograph, which is Government Exhibit 288 and also 270, which we're still talking about, that we think that portion of the video -- THE COURT: Sorry. Which ones? 288? MR. EVERDELL: So the photograph of that photograph. 288, you already excluded. That's a photo of that photo on the floor. 270 is the one we consent to, which is a photo of that photo still on the wall. And then 296 is the video walk-through where, when he does it, you will see the photo on the wall as the video goes through that hallway. And given that your Honor has excluded this at least once and we now consent to excluding it twice, we think that that portion of SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012519",
