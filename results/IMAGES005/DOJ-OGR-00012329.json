  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 747 Filed 08/10/22 Page 44 of 228 720 LC2VMAX2 Rocchio - Direct 1 A. Grooming the environment refers to -- it's most relevant to the stages two and three in terms of gaining access and then building trust. It means that the perpetrator is known to often not only develop a relationship of trust with the intended victim, but also with individuals in the victim's lives. So they may, for example, hold themselves out to parents, say, as somebody who's going to be there as a support to the parent, to fill some need that maybe the parent would like to provide for the child, but for some reason is unable to. But, again, it's a series of lies and deceptive manipulations that the perpetrator engages in so that when they spend a lot of time alone with a child, it doesn't raise any sort of suspicion and it increases access. It also increases the child's trust in the perpetrator because now you have other adults perhaps that the child trusts who are kind of conveying that this is -- this is a trustworthy and an okay person to be spending time with. Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do the techniques used by perpetrators to build a relationship with a child vary depending on the age of the child? A. Yes. Perpetrators are really quite skillful. And when they are interviewed, they'll tell you that they can really -- they work hard to pinpoint exactly what it is they need to do in order to win over the trust of a particular individual.
