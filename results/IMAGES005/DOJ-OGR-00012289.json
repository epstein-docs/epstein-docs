THE COURT: That's the factual dispute that goes to authenticity, and then if it comes in, whether the jury believes the testimony regarding that. MR.

MR. PAGLIUCA: See, I don't think that's true, your Honor, and I think that's my next point because I think it's a little fast and loose to say that it's not being offered for the truth. I mean, that's convenient to get around of the hearsay objection. THE COURT: Sometimes it works. MR. PAGLIUCA: Right. THE COURT: Sometimes it doesn't. MR. PAGLIUCA: But it is being offered for the truth in my view: The truth that these people's names are in there; the truth that these people had some sort of contact.
