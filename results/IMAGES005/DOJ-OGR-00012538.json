This evidence is probative of that question. In particular, the fact that schoolgirl costumes, small ones, were found in the same floor of the house as a massage room where an underage girl was sexually abused is certainly probative. THE COURT: It seems to me that that evidence, as you alluded, Mr. Everdell, so I have my denial of the exclusion of witness 3. There are 412 issues in that, so that is sealed, I'm going to be cautious, but I think it's consistent with what I indicated would be permitted as testimony with regard to that witness. So, I think the arguments that are being made go as to timeframe, go to weight and not admissibility, and I will overrule the objection. MR.

Our argument remains the same that it is probative of his interest in underage girls, separate and apart from it being corroborative of any witness testimony that may SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
