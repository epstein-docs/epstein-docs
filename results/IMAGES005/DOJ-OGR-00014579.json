  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 179 of 257 3013 LCKVMAX8 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey Maxwell was exactly who Alessi said she was. And just like the ex-boyfriends, Alessi has no reason to lie to you. Second. Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie have no motive to lie at this trial. The defense's only explanation for why they would perjure themselves on that stand is money. But the facts just do not support that. Remember, the victim compensation fund is finished; the civil cases are done. There's nothing pending. These women have already received millions of dollars. They are not getting a penny more. Now, the defense tried to point you to this stipulation about Jane's lawyer. I'd encourage you to take a look at it. Look at the whole stipulation. You'll see it doesn't change anything I've said. Jane's lawyer told the prosecutor that he remembered telling Jane that testifying would be the morally right thing to do and that it could help her case. But to be clear, that conversation with that prosecutor occurred in 2021, long after Jane's civil case was settled, long after she already received her award from the fund. So there was no case to help. Whatever the lawyer meant by that, there is absolutely no evidence that Jane had any financial incentive to testify at this trial. There's no money to be had. You heard Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie each tell you unequivocally they have no financial stake in the outcome of this trial. This verdict will have zero impact on the money they received.
