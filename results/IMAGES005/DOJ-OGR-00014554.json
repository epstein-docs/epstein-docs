You have to use your common sense. Money is a powerful motivating factor. The time that has elapsed has made it very difficult for people to go back and reconstruct their memories, and their memories are highly flawed. How easy is it for someone to get on the stand and say, okay, well, I know I told you many times that I don't remember her being in the room, but now I do. It's pretty easy because no one is here to confront her. Epstein is dead. No one can say that they're lying except asking them questions and pointing out that their stories are not accurate.
