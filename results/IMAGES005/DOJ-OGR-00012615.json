Some of them, yes, sir. 3 Q. And the process that you went through for paying the masseuses was, generally, you would pay them by check; is that right? 4 5 6 A. Most of the times I would pay them by check. If they request cash, I will go to my petty cash box and find if I had enough. If I had $100 or $200, I will pay in cash, otherwise it was a process of making them sign a piece of paper and make a receipt, make the check, send a copy of the check back to the office in New York, and that's how they kept the records. 7 8 9 10 11 12 Q. Okay. So the process would be someone would give a massage and sometimes they would come down and say to you, okay, I was there for an hour and you would pay them a check for $100; right? 13 14 15 16 A. Yes. The massage, when I was working with Mr. Epstein, it was $100 flat. I didn't have to tip or no tips. It was $100. And it was on repeat girls that came to the house and they will have -- they didn't want to get paid that night and they -- I just kept -- they kept a record on it for the amount of times they were there. So if it was five massage, it was $500 check, $600 check, $200 checks. 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Q. Let's just break it down so we're clear. You would either pay them when they were leaving or they could run a tab; right? 24 25 A. Yes, sir. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012615",
