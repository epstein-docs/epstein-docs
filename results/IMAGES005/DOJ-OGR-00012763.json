In short, these photos have little, if any, relevance and they're likely prejudicial because they are likely to confuse the jury. The four sets of photos that the government seeks to admit, photos 936 and 938, depict a room with a stuffed tiger and a stuffed dog. The government argues that these photos corroborate Jane's testimony that Epstein's apartment contained, quote, creepy-looking animals and animal heads and strange things. Trial transcript at 305 to 318. I will exclude these photos, first, both the dog and tiger are moveable items such that the photos taken in 2019 are, without additional testimony, not probative of what Jane would have seen years earlier. Second, though Jane described artwork of animals, she did not describe a stuffed dog or tiger. The photos therefore have little corroborative value, even if, as the government argues, the dog and tiger are highly idiosyncratic. And the photos are unfairly prejudicial because they're likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that these same items were in Epstein's apartment at the time that Jane was there. Further, the idiosyncratic nature of the items is likely to distract the jury, it could delay trial as the connection to Jane's testimony is tenuous at best. I'll note that, as I've said, the schoolgirl outfits found in the New York apartment in 2019 that the government intends to introduce, as I said on Friday, I anticipate these SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
