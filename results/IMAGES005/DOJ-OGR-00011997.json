MENNINGER: Right. I think she has a lack of personal knowledge about that, your Honor. It's a legal conclusion, a legal question. She's not the right witness to talk about that. 9 THE COURT: You want the jury -- you want to put in front of the jury that the involvement in this case affects payout from the legal compensation fund. 12 MS. MENNINGER: Well, your Honor, this is something that we litigated, which is, any suggestion that the victim's compensation fund was based on some kind of finding of validity of her claims. 16 THE COURT: I agree with that.
