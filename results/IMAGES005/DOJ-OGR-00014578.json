That doesn't make any sense for a whole host of reasons. First, if these women are lying, then that means all of the witnesses who backed them up are lying too. The ex-boyfriends, Matt, Dave, Shawn, they must be lying. Juan Alessi must be lying. That's simply nonsensical for the ex-boyfriends. Matt, Dave, and Shawn have nothing to gain from testifying here. They have no reason whatsoever to lie. No motive. Why would they come here and lie to you? The same goes for Juan Alessi. The defense spent a lot of time trying to dirty Alessi up. You know why they did that? It's because his testimony is incredibly powerful evidence that backs up so much of what these other witnesses say. But their arguments about him are really just silly. They spent time talking about the money and the gun. Remember, Mr. Alessi told you himself he stole money from Jeffrey Epstein and he paid it back. Some police report says that he was also looking for a gun. So what? Does that mean that he would make up an entire story about the defendant? No. And you know he told you the truth because he was corroborated by other evidence. Flight records confirmed that Jane and Virginia flew on Epstein's planes when they were minors, just like he told you. The pilots confirmed that Juan Alessi drove passengers up to the tarmac, just like he told you. The household manual showed you in black and white that SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
