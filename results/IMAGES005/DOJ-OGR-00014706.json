That would then put the where/if the intent was -- THE COURT: That would be an entirely different meaning to the question. MS. MENNINGER: I think so. THE COURT: No, I agree. What I don't know is I don't know what they meant and I don't know how much weight to put on that comma placement; because, as you've noted, that precise sentence without that comma has an entirely different meaning. MS. MODE: Yes, your Honor. And I think at the point at which we're parsing jury notes like statutes this finely, I think it illustrates the point that this note is confusing; that we're not sure what the jury is asking about either factually or legally. The question is about the second element; and so we think the proper course is to refer the jury to those particular instructions. And the jury is free to send a clarifying note, if they wish to do so. But I think when we are parsing commas this finely in a note that is unclear, it's unclear which clauses are modifying which clauses, or which flights we're even talking about, I think it's far too confusing to give simple answers here.
