PAGLIUCA: 183. 5 THE COURT: Sustained. 6 MR. PAGLIUCA: There's a slightly different argument on 189. 7 8 THE COURT: Okay. 9 MR. PAGLIUCA: And 195. 10 These are the end dates of the allegations, which 11 brackets it before 2004, which is inconsistent with the 12 testimony. And so these are the last two dates alleged in this 13 complaint which does not go farther than August of 2003. 14 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think the paragraphs 15 themselves are still consistent. I think Mr. Pagliuca can make 16 the point by asking the question of the witness about whether 17 there were any allegations contained after August 2003 in the 18 complaint. 19 THE COURT: Is there a line that says it's the final 20 contact? 21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, it just says August 2003, 22 incident one and incident two. 23 THE COURT: Right. 24 MR. PAGLIUCA: And there are no further allegations in 25 the complaint.
