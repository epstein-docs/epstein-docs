The testimony 3 yesterday said \"multiple occasions with her mother, some 4 occasions without the mother; in those instances, he would pick 5 her up and drive her.\" 6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay. 7 THE COURT: You agree that is the testimony? 8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Generally, yes. 9 On line 9, we have: \"I personally observed Jane along 10 with her mother on three occasions, not multiple occasions.\" 11 THE COURT: \"Three\" is not \"multiple\"? 12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Not in my view, your Honor. It is 13 inconsistent with \"multiple.\" 14 At Mr. Epstein's -- 15 THE COURT: I don't understand -- 16 MR. PAGLIUCA: It is more than one. 17 THE COURT: So is \"multiple.\" 18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, I understand. 19 THE COURT: I mean, unless we're speaking a different 20 language. 21 MR. PAGLIUCA: We may be, but this is quantifying the 22 number. It's not multiple, it's three. 23 \"At Mr. Epstein's home in Palm Beach. I don't recall 24 the year,\" which is also inconsistent with his testimony 25 yesterday. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012573",
