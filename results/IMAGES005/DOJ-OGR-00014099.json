PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, just -- THE COURT: It's like I'm getting triple-teamed here. I can barely keep up. MR. PAGLIUCA: Sometimes five heads, six heads may be better than one, sometimes maybe not. But there is an issue about a government rebuttal witness that I don't know if that's been resolved yet. And I just wanted to lay that out there for the Court. MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. We are leaning against calling that witness. We need to circle up as a team and we'll have a final decision tomorrow morning for your Honor. I doubt we will be calling any rebuttal witnesses. THE COURT: Okay. I guess the only thing I would ask you to consider is if we have time left over tomorrow, if there is a very short witness on Monday, if perhaps the government does intend to call a rebuttal, if you would consider using the time tomorrow for the rebuttal, if that's acceptable to the defense. MR. PAGLIUCA: If there is going to be a rebuttal witness, your Honor, there's going to be briefing on it tonight. THE COURT: I'm here all day. When will you come to a decision?
