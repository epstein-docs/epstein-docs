  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 147 of 257 LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger government asking you four times, Are you sure there was no sexual abuse in New Mexico? Could that possibly be pressure to give more information that sometimes leads to corrupt memories? And she explained to you that memory is a constructive process; that we often takes bits and pieces of experiences and try to put them together to make sense, which is exactly what Annie Farmer told you she did when she figured out the April 1996 date and she happened to be wrong. How vivid a memory seems does not make it more accurate. She talked about false memories being planted in people's minds. You remember things like being attacked by a vicious animal or nearly drowning; and that people can have rich false memories that have been planted in their minds. She also talked about confidence malleability; that the more confident a person gets if they receive confirming information like from their lawyer or another accuser, then they go up in their confidence. Dr. Loftus has consulted with the Department of Justice, the bosses of these prosecutors; the FBI, the people who interviewed in this case; and the Secret Service. So to be telling you that she's only a defense witness is simply not true. And if the government had called her, she would have told them the same information, it's just information they didn't want to hear. You remember the government asking questions of Dr. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014547",
