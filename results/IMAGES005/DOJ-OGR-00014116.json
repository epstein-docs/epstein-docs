THE COURT: Who is it and how long? MR. EVERDELL: How long is the witness going to be? It would be a very short witness. And this is related to the Kinnerton Street property. I think just today we got a declaration from him, which I can hand over to the government. They got this signed this morning about what his testimony would be. And I could provide it to the Court, as well. I would like it in front of me, but I could generally summarize, don't quote me on this, but he is the owner of the Nags Head Pub, which is right across the street from the Kinnerton Street residence. He owned that for the whole time that's relevant here. He knew the previous owners. He always saw them there. And he met Ghislaine Maxwell when she took ownership of the property, and he knew the prior owners to be living there, and then he knew Ghislaine to be living there when she bought the property. And he goes there every day. He owned the pub, he had a flat above the pub that looked across to the Kinnerton Street property, and he can verify the fact that she didn't take occupancy until after she purchased the apartment. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would just note that the defense has had an extraordinary amount of time to prepare its SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014116",
