I expect the Judge will instruct you reasonable doubt is a doubt based in reason in arising out of the evidence in the case or the lack of evidence. It is a doubt that a reasonable person has after carefully weighing all of the evidence in the case or the lack of evidence. So every witness you didn't hear from, every piece of document that you didn't see, every piece of evidence that you didn't see, you can take that into account and decide whether the government has met their awesome burden. In other words, if you have such a doubt as would reasonably cause a prudent person to hesitate to act in matters of importance in his or her own affairs, then you have a reasonable doubt, and in that circumstance, it is your duty to acquit Ms. Maxwell of that charge. What does that mean? It means something different to every person. But what is a matter of importance in your own affairs or someone else's own affairs? Is it whether to get heart surgery? Is it whether to buy a house? What major events in your own affairs do you need highly trustworthy information to make a decision about? And then ask whether the quality of the evidence, the lack of the evidence, the evidence that you did get, the evidence that you didn't get was of such a standard that you would not hesitate to act in a matter of importance to yourself.
