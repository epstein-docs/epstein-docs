Think about all of the other witnesses in this case. Juan Alessi, David Mulligan, Janice Swain, and the witnesses called Matt and Shawn. Think about all the ways their testimony was backed up by documents, all of the other evidence in the case. Your common sense tells you the witnesses are not lying and they just cannot be all misremembering the same thing. That just leaves one conclusion: That Maxwell is guilty and you should convict her. Let me take a step back and say this: Ladies and gentlemen, look at the evidence together, all of the evidence, and use your common sense. The evidence points to only one conclusion: That Ghislaine Maxwell sexually exploited young girls. She trafficked underage girls for sex. When you consider all of the evidence and use your common sense, you will reach the only verdict consistent with the evidence: Maxwell is guilty. THE COURT: All right. Thank you, Ms. Moe. Members of the jury, we are going to take that break for lunch. It will be a short break, 20 to 30 minutes. Ms. Williams is having it set up now. My law clerks are going to assist you getting back. I just want to pause one moment. I repeat this, even though we're at the later stages of the case. No discussions SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014474",
