COMEY: Yes, your honor.\n4 THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection to that one.\n5 MR. PAGLIUCA: The next is 1567, lines 7 through 19.\n6 THE COURT: Okay. Just give me one moment.\n7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Sure.\n8 THE COURT: Okay.\n9 MR. PAGLIUCA: And the prior inconsistent statement is at 3505, 005, page 1, second paragraph. Virginia explained Carolyn could make $300 by providing a man in Palm Beach with a massage.\n10 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, our view is that the relevant portion was read into the record and then, at lines 23 of 1567 through 2 of 1568, she was asked specifically whether she made that statement to the FBI and she responded, yes, she told me that. So I don't see how extrinsic evidence would be appropriate.\n11 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think it's inconsistent, your Honor.\n12 There is a denial and then there is a yes, she told me that, and I think with that inconsistency, we should be allowed to impeach it.\n13 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
