Your Honor, as the\n2 Court will recall, earlier today a witness identified as Kate\n3 testified that the defendant asked her to wear a schoolgirl\n4 costume. Several schoolgirl outfits were recovered from\n5 Jeffrey Epstein's residence in 2019.\n6 Here, the fact that they were schoolgirl outfits is\n7 obvious from looking at them. They are relevant because they\n8 confirm that Epstein's practice was, in fact, to prefer girls\n9 dressed as schoolgirls and to have people wear schoolgirl\n10 outfits. So it is directly corroborative of Kate's testimony\n11 on that score.\n12 They're additionally relevant because they confirm an\n13 issue, which defense has put it, in dispute in this case, that\n14 Jeffrey Epstein did, in fact, have a sexual preference for\n15 schoolgirls. That point has been vigorously disputed at trial.\n16 These exhibits confirm that that in fact was the case and\n17 corroborates the testimony of Kate that she was in fact asked\n18 to wear such an outfit.\n19 Similarly to the Court's ruling with respect to Jane's\n20 testimony and the descriptions of the massage room, here, it's\n21 not necessary for a witness to talk about the particular\n22 details of a schoolgirl costume. The point is the same, one\n23 witness was asked to wear a schoolgirl outfit and Epstein did\n24 possess those schoolgirl outfits and had a preference for\n25 people dressed that way and, in fact, forced schoolgirls.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
