  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 751 Filed 08/10/22 Page 218 of 261 1379 LC6VMAX6 Maguire - direct evidence numbers to items that are seized during the course of the search warrant? A. After we seize items of evidence at a location, we then enter them into a collected item log. At that point each item is serialized with a number that's called a 1B number that's for evidence tracking purposes with our evidence control unit. Q. And just to be clear, I believe you testified that the CDs contained in these binders were assigned evidence numbers 1B-19, is that right? A. That's correct. Q. I'd like to turn now to show you -- MS. MODE: Ms. Drescher, if you could please just show just the witness, the Court, and counsel what's been marked for identification as Government Exhibit 926. Q. Do you recognize this? A. Yes, ma'am, I do. Q. What is Government Exhibit 926? A. This is a photograph taken in the same room where the previous black binders were located. In the center of this closet room there was a drawer organizer located right there in the center. This is one of the bottom drawers where several CDs were located. Q. Is this a fair and accurate depiction of the drawer with CDs that you just described? A. Yes, ma'am. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012969",
