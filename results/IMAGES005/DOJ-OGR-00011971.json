I want to step back and ask you a little bit about your home life during the years we've been talking about. When you were 14 to 17 and living in Florida, can you describe for the jury what your home life was like during those years? A. Well, it was -- it was not great. My father had just passed away, sort of suddenly, and we found ourselves losing our home and moving into a pool house and not being allowed to grieve the loss of my father and having a very depressed mom at home. Q. I think you mentioned that you felt like you weren't allowed to grieve your father. Can you explain to the jury what you meant by that? MS. MENNINGER: Objection, your Honor. Relevance. THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer. A. Well, I grew up with a mother who didn't allow us to talk about our feelings because that was a sign of weakness. So grieving would be a part of that because she was very concerned about appearance and what we would look like and that you always sort of put a pretty face on. So we really didn't discuss those kinds of things at home and weren't allowed to discuss it with anyone else. So, being a kid and losing your dad and not being allowed to talk about it, not having anyone to talk to about it, it was really difficult. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
