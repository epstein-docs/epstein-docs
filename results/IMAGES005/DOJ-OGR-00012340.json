That testimony is struck. 5 Go ahead. 6 BY MS. POMERANTZ: 7 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and 8 training, what factors, if any, place a child at increased risk 9 of being sexually abused? 10 A. The research in particular has looked at what types of 11 vulnerability factors place children at higher risk. And they 12 generally fall into factors pertaining to either the child's 13 characteristics, personal characteristics, issues pertaining to 14 the parents and the parental characteristics, and issues 15 pertaining to the family. 16 Q. Can you explain the personal factors. 17 A. So we know that children who have experienced victimization 18 of any kind, whether it's prior child sexual abuse or physical 19 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for 20 example, of being revictimized later. We know that children 21 who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health 22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for child 23 sexual abuse. We know that children who come from 24 disadvantaged circumstances can be at higher risk, children 25 with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, for example; SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
