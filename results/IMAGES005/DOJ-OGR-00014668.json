STERNHEIM: Judge, I just wanted to add, I know\n3 that the Court typically does close the day before Christmas.\n4 But because this year Christmas is on a Saturday, I think\n5 that's why Thursday is the other day that's off.\n6 THE COURT: The courthouse is closed on Christmas Eve, of course, and Christmas. But the 23rd it's not.\n7\n8 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, would you be inclined to offer\n9 that to them today, in case they need to make arrangements, if\n10 that's an option for them?\n11 THE COURT: I'll hear from the parties.\n12 I think I could say if deliberations are ongoing or if\n13 they haven't completed their deliberations, the Court can\n14 arrange for them to deliberate on Thursday, the 23rd, if they\n15 wish to.\n16 MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor.\n17 THE COURT: Do the parties have a view as to doing\n18 that today or tomorrow, I guess, for the arrangement point?\n19 MS. STERNHEIM: I would suggest that we do it today in\n20 case they do want to have that option and need to make\n21 childcare or other arrangements.\n22 THE COURT: So I think what I said was if the jury has\n23 not completed its deliberations, it is possible for them to\n24 deliberate this week on Thursday, December 23rd, if they wish.\n25 MS.
