But she was quite firm in the one thing, she absolutely did not take part in sexual abuse with Jane. Science is science. And Dr. Loftus, Professor Loftus, would say the same thing, no matter who called her to the stand. You can look at her CV. You can't compare it to Dr. Rocchio's, because Dr. Rocchio's is not in evidence. But Dr. Rocchio told you she hasn't done any research. And you don't even need an expert to tell you some basic facts. Memory fades over time, manipulation can alter memories, and money is a powerful manipulator. Any claim to truth must be accompanied by the proof. And here, these women are claiming to be telling you true stories and true memories; but in many cases, if not most, they are contradicted by the actual documents we have from the time period. I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the law, as the government did. As you heard, Ghislaine Maxwell is charged with six counts, and you're going to have the opportunity to acquit her of all of those. I'm going to walk you through this. Counts One, Three, and Five are the ones that accuse her of participating in a conspiracy. A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to violate the law. It's SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014548",
