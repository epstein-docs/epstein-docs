COMEY: There were just a couple issues that we wanted to put on the record, your Honor.\nFirst, I've conferred with defense counsel, and they have indicated that they are releasing Carolyn from recall. So I understand that any sequestration order no longer applies to her.\nMR. PAGLIUCA: That's correct, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: All right. Thank you.\nMS. COMEY: And then I also conferred with defense counsel about Kimberly Meder and whether she would be permitted to be in the courtroom for the remainder of trial. I'm told by defense counsel that they have no objection; though, of course, they may end up seeking to recall her in the defense case, but that they have no objection to her being in the courtroom.\nMR. EVERDELL: That's correct, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nMS. COMEY: And then with respect to redacted 296, which was the video of the Palm Beach residence, defense counsel has been reviewing the redacted version that we sent them on Tuesday. Once they have their position on its admissibility, we will formally offer it.\nMR. PAGLIUCA: Also correct, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
