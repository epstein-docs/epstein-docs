VERDELL: Nothing from the defense, your Honor.\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, one last issue with respect to three exhibits. We had a chance to review the transcript from last week from the cross examination of Jane, we noticed that there were three defense exhibits that were offered which were not offered under seal but which contained identifying information for Jane, so we wanted to address that. We conferred with defense about that.\nTaking those exhibits in order, the first is Defendant's Exhibit J15. So this exhibit contains some redactions, but there is additional identifying information as to Jane. I flagged that for defense counsel. What we would propose is that we work together to mark a further redacted version which would become J15R, and that J15 itself would remain as it is and under seal as it is offered during her testimony. So we'll work with the defense to propose additional redactions, mark that, and make sure that that's in the record, but I just wanted to flag that because, as it stands, the underlying exhibit is not yet received under seal and because that contains identifying information, we'd ask that that exhibit be sealed at this juncture.\nMS. MENNINGER: I don't believe that J15 does have other additional identifying information, but I'm happy to\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00012771",
