And then confer and then you tell me, Mr. Everdell, when would you like to put in -- MR. EVERDELL: One moment, your Honor. I think if we can do it by Monday, that would be fine for the defense, if that works for the government. THE COURT: So Monday. If you're in agreement, you'll put in a submission. If you're in disagreement, the defense will move on Monday and I'll hear from the government on -- MS. MOE: Wednesday, your Honor?
