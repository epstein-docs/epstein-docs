Nothing about Jane staying in Epstein's house. And the same is true with the Santa Fe property. She told you she stayed in this big grand house, a big, big structure, big house. Annie told you she was there at roughly the same time and there was no big ranch. It was a small residence. Larry Visoski told you that big ranch wasn't built until the late '90s, and guess what, there is a flight log entry showing that Jane went there when she was 21 when the big house was there. That's when Jane went to Santa Fe. She didn't remember her other trips, her trips abroad. We know her memory was contaminated post-event because she was talking to her family members, her exboyfriend, Matt. She was reading the news, she hired a lawyer to cancel all the news about her, not to report this claim. She was reading the news and now she's incorporating all of those facts into her head and trying to make some kind of sense out of it. She has deliberately, however, attempted to move the timeline back to make herself younger when she was with Epstein.
