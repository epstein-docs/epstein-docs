ROHRBACH: Your Honor, I think it's helpful to -- I think Mr. Pagliuca is talking about the contact book and not the household manual. THE COURT: Would you pull up the microphone? MR. ROHRBACH: I think Mr. Pagliuca is talking about the contact book and not the household manual, which are different documents, but specifically with regard to the contact book, the government expects the evidence will show either that it was the defendant's contact book, or through the witness we talk about in our letter, the defendant and Epstein's contact book, in which case would also be a statement of the defendant or her co-conspirator. Again, if this were offered for the truth, it could come out without the requirement apply 803(6). THE COURT: I was surprised that argument hadn't been made earlier. I think that was the first time the government articulated that, although may we haven't been focused on the hearsay objection that much, although it was raised. But I don't see why that's wrong. I mean, they have an alternate theory: Either it's not being offered for the truth or if it is being offered for the truth, the evidence they anticipate that will come in is that it is statements of the defendant or Mr. Epstein in furtherance of the conspiracy. MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't know whether we're talking SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012290",
