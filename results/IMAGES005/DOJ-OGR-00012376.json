No, it's not an assumption, because a lot of the research that I'm talking about and much of my experience in both clinical and forensic settings has been conducted when the abuse is actually known or have been found in a court of law to have occurred or the event offender has admitted to the behavior. Q. You offered some opinions about grooming, Dr. Rocchio. I think you referred to grooming as a series of tactics and strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child building a relationship of trust and then eventually sexually abusing the child. Is that correct? A. Yeah, that's a summary of what I said. Sure, yes. Q. And these behaviors that you're referring to as grooming behaviors can also be non-grooming behaviors as well, correct? A. Some of them can, yes. Q. And so there are many things that we do that in hindsight one might say is grooming, but prospectively you can't tell whether or not it's grooming, right? A. It would be important though to -- grooming is not a specific behavior. It's a series and a pattern of behavior that's taking into account the entire pattern. So it wouldn't be just a specific individual behavior. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012376",
