Are you going to be moving those into evidence?\n2 THE COURT: 823 and 824.\n3 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, I am.\n4 MS. STERNHEIM: You can hold onto them if you would like. I imagine they'll be putting them on the screen.\n5 THE COURT: I'll keep them for now then. Thank you.\n6 (Recess)\n7 THE COURT: We have one juror who had a substantial train issue and had to back up and revert, who called worried that they were late and we said just get here safely. So we're not quite ready with all the jurors yet.\n8 Mr. Rohrbach, you know that case, United States v. Lieberman?\n9 MR. ROHRBACH: I am not familiar with that case, your Honor.\n10 THE COURT: It's pretty much directly on point, I think, for Ms. Sternheim's argument regarding the content of 823 and 824.
