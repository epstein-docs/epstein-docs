You also know that Maxwell enticed Jane to New York because Jane told you about the pattern of her relationship with Maxwell and Epstein. She told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for school. That money wasn't free, and part of the cause was getting Jane on the plane with them to go to New York where she was sexually abused. That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion. The second element is that Jane traveled in interstate commerce. We've already discussed how you know that Jane traveled from New York from out of state. You know that from Jane's testimony, from Juan Alessi's testimony, and from the flight records. The third element is that the defendant intended that Jane would engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, and you're going to learn that it's a crime to engage in sexual contact with a kid under 17 who is too young to consent. And the evidence shows you that Maxwell absolutely intended that Jane would be abused in New York. That was the whole point of bringing her there, so that Epstein could have access to Jane. They weren't traveling for mentorship or scholarships, they weren't traveling with an underage girl because they were friends, they were getting her to travel so that she could be molested and that's exactly what happened. The evidence shows SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014457",
