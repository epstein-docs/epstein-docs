STERNHEIM: Judge -- 4 THE COURT: Is her testimony on her CV? 5 MS. STERNHEIM: No. 6 THE COURT: I just wanted to know that. 7 MS. STERNHEIM: I don't believe it has testimony. 8 It's a CV of her academic pursuits, her awards, her 9 publications. 10 THE COURT: Not the cases she's testified. 11 MS. STERNHEIM: No. 12 THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead. 13 MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, I certainly understand the 14 desire on the part of the government to do some character 15 assassination. But the fact of the matter, testifying in a 16 high-profile case is being used in a way that is very insidious 17 here. I don't understand what the purpose is. Are they 18 getting into her testimony in that case? 19 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I'm happy to respond. 20 So the witness has financial incentive to testify on 21 behalf of the defense. It's not a question of just getting 22 paid by the defendant in this case. Over her career she has 23 used her testimony as a defense -- as an expert for the defense 24 to testify at trials. 25 In her book she has a chapter, the book that she has SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
