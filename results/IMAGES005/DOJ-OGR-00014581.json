Given how consistent their accounts are with each other and with the other witnesses in this case, that would mean that at least eight people -- Jane Kate, Carolyn, Annie, Dave, Shawn, Matt, and Juan Alessi -- all are part of a massive conspiracy to frame the defendant. And then they just happened to be lucky enough that the FBI had documents to back up what they said: Flight records, FedEx records, message pads, contact book, household manual to back up their lies.\n\n13 Beyond how implausible such a massive conspiracy of eight people to lie in a federal court is, the timing here makes it impossible. Remember, the defense's theory is that the incentive to frame Maxwell arose after Epstein died in 2019. So this supposed frame job was hatched in 2019, meaning Carolyn had to get in a time machine, go back to 2009 and sprinkle in a couple references to Maxwell in her deposition. And then Annie had to borrow that time machine, go back to 2006, and tell the FBI about how Maxwell touched her breast during a massage.\n\n23 Ladies and gentlemen, that's fiction. You know that did not happen. Annie told the FBI about Maxwell because it was the truth. Carolyn described Maxwell in her deposition was the truth.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
