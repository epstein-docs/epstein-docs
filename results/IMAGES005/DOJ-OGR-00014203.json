Your Honor, this is an issue I believe we raised in advance of trial about the relevance of asking witnesses about uncharged conduct and whether the defendant or Epstein committed crimes in other instances that are not charged. I think the foundation here is about the entirety of a very broad relationship between, I think, the 1980s and the present, and the question is whether, over several decades, she was aware of any kind of inappropriate conduct with other people. It's extraordinarily broad. And as we briefed in advance of trial, there is no relevance, it's inappropriate to suggest that there are uncharged conduct on other occasions is probative of what happened with the particular individuals at issue in this case.
