It's not illegal to own schoolgirl costumes, but it directly speaks to a sexual preference for underage girls and its relevance is readily apparent in connection with the testimony in this case. MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the fact that Jeffrey Epstein may have had schoolgirl costumes in 2019, 15 years after the conspiracy, is not probative of anything in this case. There is no link whatsoever to anything in this residence so far with Ms. Maxwell. We had testimony that she never lived in this residence. So I don't see how anything this attenuated that doesn't have a link to our client that is potentially prejudicial and there is no testimony establishing its relevance at all to begin with should be admitted before the jury.
