  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 757 Filed 08/10/22 Page 8 of 49 1981 LC9VMAXT doesn't exceed the scope of the ordinary practice. THE COURT: Let's take the specific example that you've given on message pads. So just give me an example of the kind of testimony he would provide there. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. So, for example, within the message pads, we published yesterday, I think, just either two or three specific messages that had a first and last name of someone and a phone number. But elsewhere throughout the message pads, there appear entries that only have a first name, and sometimes that entry is, for example, Carolyn and sometimes it's Caroline. But when you compare the phone numbers -- and there are a variety of different phone numbers throughout the book -- it becomes clear that Caroline is the same Carolyn, first and last name, as some of the other messages, because there's continuity between the phone numbers. And there are a variety of different phone numbers throughout the exhibits with different names like Carolyn, Caroline, and Carolyn with a last name. And reviewing them and analyzing them makes it clear throughout the books and across a variety of different dates that we're talking about the same person. And so that facilitates both publishing the exhibits so that the jury can see them for the first time, and doing that in a way that sort of connects up those different exhibits. And so that's the purpose of that testimony. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013549",
