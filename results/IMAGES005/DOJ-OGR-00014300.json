I want to give it just one more read. I haven't had time to do that today given the issues that occupied the lunch break. I would say by 6:00 p.m., you'll have a copy of my draft charge and the draft verdict sheet and we'll meet at 9:00 a.m. here for the charging conference tomorrow.\nMS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.\nJust on a separate housekeeping matter, your Honor, I just wanted to flag, given the number of issues we're trying to streamline and resolve today and yesterday, we haven't had a chance yet to discuss logistics for closing, but we want to make sure we iron that out so we make sure we're ready to go on Monday morning. I wanted to flag that we'll confer this evening to make sure we're on the same page on logistics and screens and the like.\nWould the Court prefer that we reach out about a proposal about how that should be arranged? I want to make sure we're not causing any delay on Monday morning.\nTHE COURT: I mean, I think confer with the court staff to make sure you have what you need. Only if there is a dispute do you need to raise it with me.\nMS. MOE: Is there anyone in particular within the courthouse staff we should reach out to about logistics?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014300",
