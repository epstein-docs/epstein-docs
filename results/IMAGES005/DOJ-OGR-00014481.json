Ghislaine Maxwell is an innocent woman wrongfully accused of crimes she did not commit. The government has failed to prove any charges beyond a reasonable doubt, and the just and only correct verdict in this case is not guilty on each and every count. The evidence presented at trial has established exactly what we told you it would during openings, that the stories relied on by the government are the product of erroneous memories, manipulation, and money. But, in this case, the order is reversed. The money brought the accusers to the FBI with their personal injury lawyers sitting right there next to them. The lawyers manipulated their stories and the government accepted those stories at face value without ever testing them or corroborating them or checking with other witnesses to see if they were accurate. And suddenly, the women recovered memories years later, they recovered memories that Ghislaine was involved, that Ghislaine was there, that Ghislaine is the culprit. Just as we predicted in our opening statement, the government spent a lot of time focusing you on Epstein, on his character, on his lifestyle, on his flaws, and they certainly proved to you that Epstein had abused his money and his power. They proved to you that he was a master manipulator. That has nothing to do with Ghislaine and everything to do with Jeffrey Epstein. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014481",
