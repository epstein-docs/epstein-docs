Of course, Maxwell knew what was going on in that house. She had a firm grip on everything that was happening there. She was Epstein's partner. Now, the household manual isn't the only document that you saw at this trial that showed you that Maxwell had a firm grip on that household and that she knew everything that was going on there. I want you to take a look at Government Exhibit 420. This document is dated in 2002. And the metadata tells you that it was written by, you guessed it, G. Max. This document shows you that Maxwell wrote out a detailed list of 13 different oils and lotions for massages in Palm Beach. She was intimately involved in all of the details of Epstein's so-called massages. In fact, even the sex toys in the massage room had to be returned to a basket in Maxwell's bathroom closet. That's what Mr. Alessi had to do. Here's his testimony about that. He told you about having to wash off dildos after the massages and how he would return them to a basket in Maxwell's closet, because that's where they were kept.

She was in on the whole thing. So we were talking about the household manual. What SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014414",
