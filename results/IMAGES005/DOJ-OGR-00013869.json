MR. EVERDELL: Correct. THE COURT: It sounds like there are different stages in the purchase process. MR. EVERDELL: Well, yes. But the records also reflect in the land registry that the ownership existed with this couple whose last time is O'Neill. They owned it under the land registry records as of 1992. That title passes then to Ms. Maxwell in 1997. These are both land registry entries which I have here, if the Court would like to see them. And what Mr. Grumbridge's records -- the agreement for sale, for example, just shows the process of that contracting, right. So in December of '96, the parties exchange contracts; Mr. and Mrs. O'Neill and Ms. Maxwell entered into contract for sale for this property. And that deal closed as of January 1997. That's reflected in the agreement for sale. And then the notice is given to the land registry to make it an official land record by March of '97. So there's a record on file in the land registry recording that the title has passed from the O'Neills to Ms. Maxwell as of March of '97. So there's a couple of documents that we think are relevant that we think Mr. Rooney could enter into evidence. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013869",
