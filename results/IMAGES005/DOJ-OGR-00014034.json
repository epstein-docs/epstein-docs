PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, the objection is that this 3 is far afield from her expert testimony. We're picking one 4 study out of hundreds and then going into it. 5 When I attempted to cross-examine Dr. Rocchio on a 6 study that she relied on, I was precluded from doing that and I 7 think the objection was similar. And the Court sustained the 8 objection saying, you know, we're not going to go into all of 9 the studies that she may or may not have relied on in support 10 of her testimony. 11 This is similar to that. Dr. Loftus is testifying 12 about a broad range of studies; and to single one out is, you 13 know, overly prejudicial, not very helpful to the jury, doesn't 14 go to any of the opinions that she's offered in this case. 15 THE COURT: I'm sorry, can you remind me of the 16 parallel objection. 17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes. There was a study that was given 18 to the prosecution by Dr. Rocchio on hindsight bias and -- 19 basically hindsight bias and what went into hindsight bias. 20 THE COURT: You were trying to introduce affirmative 21 evidence through that study and not using it to impeach her 22 reliance on it; correct? 23 MR. PAGLIUCA: I disagree. I was trying to impeach 24 her and using some of the words from that study to impeach her 25 on what her opinions were during trial.
