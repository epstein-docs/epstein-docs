It was a large -- a large piece of property in New\n3 Mexico, so kind of a desert landscape. And there were\n4 different sections. And there was one that had like an old\n5 movie set, like a western movie set on it. And then there was\n6 a portion where we were staying where there's a small\n7 residence.\n8 THE COURT: I'd ask you again, Ms. Farmer, if you can\n9 maybe shift it a little bit closer to you.\n10 Thank you. Perfect. Thank you.\n11 Q. Who, if anyone, did you meet at the ranch?\n12 A. When I arrived, I had met -- I mean, I saw Epstein, and\n13 then I met Ghislaine Maxwell.\n14 Q. What did Maxwell look like?\n15 A. She was trim, attractive woman, well-dressed, dark hair.\n16 Q. About how old did Maxwell seem?\n17 A. I believe she was in her thirties, so at the time she was\n18 an adult.\n19 MS. POMERANTZ: Ms. Drescher, can we please pull up\n20 what's in evidence as Government Exhibit 115.\n21 Q. Annie, do you recognize the person in this photograph?\n22 A. I do.\n23 Q. Who is it?\n24 A. Ghislaine Maxwell.\n25 MS.
