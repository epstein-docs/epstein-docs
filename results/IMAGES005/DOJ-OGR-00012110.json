The paragraph begins with \"Maxwell.\" The 11 second sentence of that paragraph. 12 MS. MOE: I also object as mischaracterizing. 13 THE COURT: Sustained. 14 Q. Did you tell the government that you recall one incident in 15 New York where Maxwell was present? 16 MS. MOE: Same objection, your Honor. 17 THE COURT: Sustained. 18 A.
