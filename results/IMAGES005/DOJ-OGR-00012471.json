And I will tell you whether I'm -- presuming -- I'm going to hear the voir dire. You'll move it. I'll either overrule -- there will be an objection. I'll either overrule the objection, sustain the objection, or reserve. 6 MS. COMEY: Understood. 7 THE COURT: The other option I sort of reserve sub A is conditionally admit it pending further testimony. But I may not do that. I'm not sure. 10 MS. COMEY: Understood, your Honor. Thank you. 11 MR. PAGLIUCA: To the extent it matters, I would be opposed to conditionally admitting the exhibit, your Honor. 13 THE COURT: I want to just get in my head the question. The question I have in mind that drew the foundation objection was, Mr. Alessi, based on your review of this book, do you believe this is the same book that you saw when you worked for Mr. Epstein or a later version after you left? 18 And he said, This was a later version of the book after I left, that it was printed probably after I left. 21 And then the objection came after that, lack of foundation. 22 The question was, What makes you say this is a later version, Mr. Alessi, which was what I thought would elicit -- be responsive to the foundation objection. 25 And he said, The book is a lot thinner.
