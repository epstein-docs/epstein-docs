MENNINGER: I think it was not Ms. Meder --\n5 Maguire, Kelly Maguire.\n6 MR. EVERDELL: She was the agent who did the search.\n7 THE COURT: Did you cross on devices found?\n8 MR. EVERDELL: I don't believe I did, your Honor.\n9 THE COURT: Why not? I mean, I'm not trying to probe\n10 strategy but, like, isn't that precisely --\n11 MS. MENNINGER: I think Maguire only did certain parts\n12 of the search, in the same way that the Palm Beach -- there\n13 were only agents that did certain parts of the search. Agent\n14 Young was in charge of the search more broadly.\n15 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, that's not accurate.\n16 Special Agent Maguire testified that she was the\n17 search team leader who oversaw the entire search of that New\n18 York residence. And this was absolutely an avenue of cross\n19 that defense could have taken. We may have objected, depending\n20 on how it was phrased, but we put on the search team leader\n21 from that search.\n22 MR.
