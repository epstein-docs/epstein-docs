Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a trial free from prejudice; and our judicial system cannot work unless you reach your verdict through a fair and impartial consideration of the evidence. Instruction No. 6. All parties are equal before the law. You are to perform the duty of finding the facts without bias or prejudice as to any party. You are to perform your final duty in an attitude of complete fairness and impartiality. The fact that the prosecution is brought in the name of the United States of America entitles the government to no greater consideration than that given to any other party to this litigation. By the same token, the government is entitled to no less consideration. All parties stand as equals at the bar of justice. Instruction No. 7. Presumption of innocence and burden of proof. The law presumes the defendant to be innocent of all charges against her. Ms. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to the charges in the indictment. As a result, the burden is on the government to prove Ms. Maxwell's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to each charge. This burden never shifts to the defendant for the simple reason that the law never imposes upon a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
