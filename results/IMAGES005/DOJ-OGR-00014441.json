That's the fifth way that you know Maxwell is guilty.\n2 This is Carolyn when she was a teenage girl. Carolyn met Maxwell through a girl she knew named Virginia Roberts. So I'm going to start by talking to about Virginia Roberts.\n3 This is Government Exhibit 113 and 114. That's Virginia. This is the same girl that Juan Alessi remembered. He told you about how he was driving to Mar-a-Lago one day. He was driving Maxwell one day by Mar-a-Lago, and Maxwell saw this girl and told him to pull over. Maxwell got out of the car and went to go talk to that girl.\n4 Here's his testimony. She told me to stop - John, stop - and I stopped the car and she opened the door and she went towards this girl as she was coming down the ramp. She went to go talk to this girl. And sure enough, he saw Virginia at the house later that day. When she arrived, Alessi brought her to see Maxwell. After that, he remembered that Virginia started coming to the house and spending time with Maxwell and Epstein. He told you about that.\n5 We'll talk more in a moment about Virginia, but I want to be very clear that the Virginia Roberts that Carolyn told you about is the very same Virginia Roberts that Juan Alessi told you about. It's the same girl that Maxwell pulled over to talk to.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00014441",
