We'll get them colored Post-Its, white paperboard. I'm not sure exactly what they mean but we'll try and find a large pad, and we'll also give them a whiteboard and dry erase markers and then highlighters.\nMs. Moe, Matt's transcript you'll get printed immediately?\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay. And then I'll hear from the parties as to how they would like to respond to the request for a definition of \"enticement.\"\nMS.
