But now, as she sits on the stand, she can't recall whether she was ever alone in the room. And as we talked about in her interrogatory response, she was asked in 2020 to identify all other persons, other than Epstein, who had ever committed or attempted to commit sexual misconduct. This is notable not only because she doesn't identify Ghislaine, but she also doesn't identify all these other women who were supposedly in these orgies with her when she was 14 over a three-year period. She'd given names to the government, like Eva and Michelle and Sophie, but she doesn't tell them here in her sworn pleading. You've seen this before, but I just want to bring up Jane's actual birthdate as we talk through some of the timeline so you can remember when she was 14, 15, or 16, and I want to talk about the story of Jane, the one that's actually backed by documents and facts. It is true that her father died when she was 13, which is a tragedy and is sad. She went on to tell you, though, that she was so stricken by poverty that she had no lunch money at times, and she was homeless. That's not the way it looked to the outside world. She's applying to go to an arts camp with her two brothers every summer for three years. That arts camp costs $4,000 per person, per summer, so $12,000 per year, all three of them go all three years. They don't even apply for SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014497",
