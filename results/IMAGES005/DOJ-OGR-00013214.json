So it's really a cumulative argument. The point that you want to make, I presume you'll make on redirect. Since the point has already been made, I don't see that there is tremendous prejudice in including the document itself. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, my concern would be that these are crafted by lawyers in order to satisfy the elements of particular causes of action. THE COURT: Right. MS. COMEY: It will confuse the issues and it's not written in a narrative form and it wasn't offered by this witness, and I think it would confuse the issues to start putting these words in that her attorneys wrote. She did not write this. THE COURT: I think those are fine redirect points. We've already established the 401 of the omission, I don't think it causes substantial 403 prejudice, and you're going to make those redirect points in any event. So at least with respect to this document C4, I'm going to overrule the objection. C5, I think might be in a different position.
