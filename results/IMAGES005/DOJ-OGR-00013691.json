THE COURT: Yes. (Pause) MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, there is a bit of a disagreement about the redactions, but I don't want to hold up the presentation for the jury. So we can take that up later. THE COURT: Sure. MS. MENNINGER: But I do want to ask the witness a couple of questions. So if I could direct her attention to what we have marked as AF1, and it's going to be page 4 of that exhibit. THE COURT: We have a terminological issue, because that was originally AF1, but we just admitted the one page as AF1. How about this, we'll go back, I'll admit under seal, again, temporarily, AF1 as a seven-page document. MS. MENNINGER: Thank you. THE COURT: Recognizing there is overlap between some of the pages of the AF1 and Government Exhibit 603. MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor. We can work that out. THE COURT: Ms. Pomerantz. MS. POMERANTZ: That's fine, your Honor. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013691",
