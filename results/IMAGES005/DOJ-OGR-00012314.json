Thank you so much. BY MS. POMERANTZ: Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain for the jury at a high level what a forensic practice is. A. So an attorney will hire me and they'll ask me -- they'll explain the issue that they need help with. It may be could I come in and talk about a subject that is within my area of expertise. It might be, for example, if somebody has claimed that they've been harmed, say, through childhood sexual abuse, they'll ask me to do an evaluation to determine whether or not the individual has any problems or mental health issues; and if they do, whether those problems and mental health issues are attributable either in whole or in part to the abuse that they've alleged. In a criminal case I might be asked to determine what, if any, role an individual's mental health may have had or their traumatic experiences may have had on the crime that they are accused of. Or in sentencing issues I might be asked to do a psychological evaluation and provide information that might be relevant for purposes of sentencing. Q. Approximately how many forensic evaluations have you conducted? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012314",
