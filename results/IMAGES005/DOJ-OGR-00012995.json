Thank you. 3 4 (Witness excused) 5 Everyone may be seated. 6 Okay, Ms. Menninger, GX304. 7 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. I have an extra set 8 of the exhibits that I believe that the government intends to 9 offer through this witness, if I may approach for the Court's 10 benefit. 11 THE COURT: Sure. Okay. 12 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, there are obviously 13 several categories of different types of photographs that are 14 contained in the exhibits that I believe the government intends 15 to offer. Some of them obviously are pictures of Ms. Maxwell 16 and Mr. Epstein at various places, times, et cetera. There is 17 no witness that I'm aware of that's going to talk about when 18 these photographs were taken, where they were taken, what they 19 accurately represent, et cetera. 20 I think the more problematic ones, though, are of 21 individuals, including just one of, for example, my client 22 laying on a boat at some unknown point in time in some unknown 23 location. There are others that are people who have testified, 24 in fact recently in this case. 25 I would direct the Court's attention to 309, which is SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
