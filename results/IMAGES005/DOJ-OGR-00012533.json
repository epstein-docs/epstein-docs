We alerted the defense but neglected to alert the Court. We let the defense know yesterday that due to some travel issues with the pace of trial, we need to reorder the witnesses. So we will be doing Parkinson, then Dawson, then Maguire, then Meder, then Flatley, and I think that will take us through the end of the day, but if we need to, there are some additional witnesses who we can get to come to the courthouse.\n3 THE COURT: Shelling is not today?\n4 MR. EVERDELL: We stipulated to --\n5 MS. COMEY: We stipulated to Shelling.\n6 THE COURT: So Parkinson, Dawson, Maguire.\n7 MS. COMEY: Correct, your Honor.\n8 THE COURT: Meder or Flatley?\n9 MS. COMEY: Meder, then Flatley.\n10 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if you want, we can take up the issue of Maguire later if you prefer because I don't think she'll go on until after lunch, most likely.\n11 MS. COMEY: I think that's very likely.\n12 THE COURT: Let me just see if we have a note that we have all our jurors. Until we have all our jurors, I'll take it up.\n13 MR.
