THE COURT: When did you start attempting to contact this witness? MR. EVERDELL: We issued a subpoena to her, and I don't have the dates off the top of my head, your Honor. I can find that out for you. THE COURT: Two and a half weeks ago? MR. EVERDELL: I think that's when we issued the subpoena. THE COURT: And you've had no contact? MR. EVERDELL: We've been trying to contact her, but no. MS. MENNINGER: We gave her a letter with all of our contact information contemporaneous with our subpoena. Every witness that we have subpoenaed has been in touch with us, they have called our paralegal, et cetera. THE COURT: But you haven't raised this until now. MS. COMEY: That's exactly the point, your Honor. The defense has had extensive time to raise this issue and they are raising it at the 11th hour when they could have raised it long in advance when all of the other witnesses they subpoenaed were in touch with them and this one was not. MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, look, if the government is willing to agree to a stipulation as to this witness's SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014121",
