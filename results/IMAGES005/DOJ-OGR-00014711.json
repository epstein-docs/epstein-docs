MENNINGER: Your Honor, at this point, because it\n2 has only been three days, we believe that any suggestion that\n3 they should stay later is beginning to sound like urging them\n4 to hurry up, when clearly they know that they can deliberate as\n5 long as they want and they should be able to deliberate as long\n6 as they want. They haven't expressed any hesitation. They've\n7 been asking for transcripts, they've been asking for materials.\n8 While we would not mind the Court giving an instruction much\n9 like it did last week, telling the jurors that should they\n10 choose to stay later on any given day, the Court can make\n11 arrangements for them to do so, we would object to trying to\n12 urge them to stay later if they are not asking to do so and\n13 aren't expressing any difficulty in proceeding with the\n14 deliberations that they are currently undertaking.\n15 MS. MOE: Your Honor, the Court has previously extended\n16 certain days or contracted certain days, depending on our\n17 schedule; and, in fact, I think the first day of deliberations\n18 we had an extended day on the consent of both parties. We don't\n19 believe that sends any kind of signal, other than that the\n20 Court is setting a schedule. And we think that's appropriate\n21 here given the circumstances.\n22 THE COURT: I think what we should do, I'll tell them\n23 that if deliberations are not complete starting tomorrow, I\n24 would like you to make yourselves available to deliberate until\n25 at least 6 p.m. each day. Of course, if you all agree to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
