COMEY: Your Honor, this is not an FBI protocol. 3 I think all of the predicate questions leading up to this 4 document was about FBI protocols. This is a Department of 5 Justice protocol that references the United States Marshal 6 Service. So I would object to further questioning or reading 7 from this. 8 MS. MENNINGER: It talks about the policy applicable 9 to FBI agents in the very first sentence. 10 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, this is from the Justice -- 11 THE COURT: Just a second. 12 MR. EVERDELL: I'm sorry, your Honor. 13 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would also note that I 14 believe I have walked away from opening the door on 15 interrogating the methods used to conduct -- 16 THE COURT: You asked if it was recorded.

I believe Ms. Menninger asked if it was. I asked if 22 it was a transcript. 23 THE COURT: Let me check. The question on cross was, 24 are they transcripts, are they verbatim. Not about recording. 25 MS. MENNINGER: Right. But the recording would give SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014194",
