I am going to send you back in a moment to begin your deliberations.\n3 There are five of you who are alternate jurors, and I'm going to tell you, you're the higher number five. They are juror number 125, juror number 149, 151, 152, and 170.\n4 The alternate jurors were not to participate in the deliberations, however, it is possible, and it does happen, that we need to bring an alternate juror back in order to participate in the deliberations. So, I am going to release the alternate jurors.\n5 You can't participate in the deliberations unless and until you hear from Ms. Williams that you're being brought back into the deliberations. However, because you could be brought back into the deliberations, and because it does happen, all of my rules continue to apply.\n6 So, for my alternate jurors, no communications with anyone through any means about the case, no discussions, no consuming of any information through any means about the case until you hear from Ms. Williams either asking you to come back because we need you for the deliberations or telling you that the process is over, and that is very important.\n7 So, again, the alternates are 125, 149, 151, 152, and 170.\n8 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
