So the source of the post-event information does matter.\nThere's even one study with children that shows that young children are more likely to accept suggestions from adults than from other children.\nQ. And in looking at memory, is there any way for you to tell, based upon your training, experience, and research, whether a memory is real or the product of post-event information?\nMS. POMERANTZ: Objection.\nTHE COURT: Sustained.\nQ. Just going back for a moment, you spoke about post-event information and post-event suggestion. What is post-event contamination?\nA. Post-event contamination would be a situation where there was suggestive information that maybe led to a contamination. You could have post-event suggestion and have people resist the suggestion. But I think if I were going to use the term \"post-event contamination,\" it would mean that somebody was exposed to the suggestive information and it actually contaminated them.\nMS.
