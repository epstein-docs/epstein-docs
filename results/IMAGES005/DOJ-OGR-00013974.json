Yes, there is -- well, one study that's coming to mind is -- this is a study that we published somewhat later in the 2000s, maybe around 2008 or so, along with my former Ph.D. student who is now professor of psychology, Dr. Laney. This was a study where we -- we didn't just change memory for turning a stop sign into a yield sign, but we planted entire events into the minds of research witnesses, events that did not happen. And then we measured people's emotional reactions to these false memories. So we planted false memories, for example, that you witnessed your parents having a physically violent fight when you were a kid or that you accidentally caught your parents, you know, having sex when you were a kid. And once we succeeded in planting these false memories and measured people's emotional reactions, they were just as emotional about these created memories as other individuals were who truly had had those experiences. So the bottom line there was that emotion is no guarantee that you're dealing with an authentic memory. Q. Professor Loftus, in devising a research project, do you need to gain approval from any organization or from your university to permit you to engage in that experiment? A. Yes, we do. Colleges and universities have human subjects, review committees. And when we want to propose to do a study with humans, there are separate groups that review studies with SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013974",
