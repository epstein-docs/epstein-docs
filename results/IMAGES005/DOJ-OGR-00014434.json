It was powerful testimony and it was difficult to hear, but you know from your direct observations that she was telling you the truth. You also know it was true because her testimony was extensively corroborated by Alessi, by Matt, and by documents like the flight records, school records, and camp records. And you know it because you recognize the same playbook they ran with Jane when you compare it with what Epstein and Maxwell did with the other witnesses at this trial, and the lengths the defense went to, to try to discredit Jane, just tells you how devastating her testimony was. It proves Maxwell is guilty. Jane was a kid in middle school. She was sexually exploited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. If you believe Jane's testimony, the defendant is guilty on counts One through Four of the indictment. I want to talk to you now about Annie. The fourth reason that you know that Maxwell is guilty is Annie Farmer. Here's Annie. Annie told you about meeting Jeffrey Epstein in New York in December 1995. She was 16 years old. Epstein said that he was taking an interest in her as a student and he talked to Annie about college. Then Epstein took her to the movies with her sister, Maria. During that movie, he held Annie's hand and rubbed her arm. He hid it from Maria, but he was rubbing Annie's arm during the movie. He was trying to desensitize Annie to his touch.
