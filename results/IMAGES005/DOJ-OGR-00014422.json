So when Jane told you about meeting Maxwell and Epstein at summer camp in 1994, you know that's the truth. What Jane didn't know that summer, but what you learned at this trial, is that Maxwell and Epstein were targeting her for sexual abuse. By the time she started spending time with Maxwell and Epstein in Palm Beach, she was an 8th grader. She was in middle school. Epstein told Jane's mother that he would help Jane; that he gave scholarships. That was the cover. But once Maxwell and Epstein started spending time with Jane alone, they started grooming her for abuse right away. Jane described how Maxwell acted like she was an older sister figure; how she went to the movies with Maxwell and Epstein. They took her shopping. They bought her white underwear. Epstein gave her money. She saw Maxwell topless by the pool. And by the way, you know that's true because now you've seen Maxwell topless by the pool too. Jane told you about how Maxwell would chitchat with her, talking about school and then about boyfriends and sex. There was a purpose for all of this. Maxwell and Epstein were setting the stage for what was going to come next. Jane told you about how one day after this initial grooming, Epstein walked her down to the pool house. He pulled her onto his lap and started masturbating on her. Here's her SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014422",
