So I think that -- THE COURT: So the defense has questioned multiple witnesses on their perceptions of individual ages, of relevant individuals' ages, so that puts into question the knowledge element with respect to ages, and it's true there's testimony from each of the alleged victims as to what they told Ms. Maxwell, but of course I don't know whether the jury will accept that testimony or not, or any of those individual pieces of testimony. So it seems like having -- the question here is whether there are specific elements, knowledge elements that are in issue, either because it's what some of the evidence goes to or because the defense has made cross-points or will make arguments regarding that.
