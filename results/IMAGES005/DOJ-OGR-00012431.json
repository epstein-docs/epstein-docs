PAGLIUCA: I don't think that's a compound question. THE COURT: Overruled. Q. You wouldn't have had 606 because assuming the date on 606 is even accurate, it's after you left; correct? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And so you, Mr. Alessi, don't have any personal knowledge about, first of all, how 606, this exhibit, came into existence; correct? Because this is not whatever it was that you had? A. No, I did not have it. Q. Right. Okay. And you, Mr. Alessi, didn't have this Exhibit 606 with you after you left. You threw whatever was given to you away, as I understood it; correct? A. Yes, I did. Q. Because you didn't agree with whatever was given to you? MS. COMEY: Objection, your Honor. This is voir dire. THE COURT: Just a moment. I'll sustain with respect to the last question. MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay. Q. But so we're clear, whatever you were given, you threw it away and didn't keep it after you left in 2002? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012431",
