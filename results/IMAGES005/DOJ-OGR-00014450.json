Here's another page. JE, GM, ET, Virginia Roberts. Here's another, JE, GM, ET, Virginia Roberts. There is another one, JE, GM, ET, Virginia Roberts. This is 2001 when Virginia Roberts was 17. They were flying around with a 17-year-old girl. But back to the black book, there is more to talk about. Remember Sean, Carolyn's boyfriend? There is an entry for him, too, under an entry for Carolyn, Carolyn's boyfriend's house. That entry has Carolyn's first and last name. That same phone number that you're looking at here is on three messages from the message pads, and here they are. It's Government Exhibits 2-U, 2-P, and 2-O. And if you take a look at the date on the two messages on the left, they're from 2003 when Carolyn was 16. There's the phone number. It's the same. In fact, the message in the middle is from just a month past Carolyn's 16th birthday. There is more. There is an entry in here for Carolyn with her full name. That number is on phone messages from 2003, too. Here they are. One says Carolyn, two say Caroline, but you know it's the same person, you know it's Carolyn because the phone number is the same. Who else is in this book? Remember how Sean told you that he would bring a 16-year-old girl named Melissa to the house with Carolyn? It's this girl in the photograph with Carolyn. She's the one right next to Carolyn. That's SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014450",
