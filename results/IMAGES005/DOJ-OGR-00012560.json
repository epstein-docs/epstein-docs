We go down to page 147, which is in the left side there, if we go to line 9. \"Q. Now, do you recall that in September of 2002 -- Q. This is right at the same time that you were breaking into Mr. -- shortly, a year, a year before you broke into Mr. Epstein's house, September of 2002, you and your wife purchased a multifamily residential property at Sequoia Drive in West Palm Beach, that's correct, and the purchase price was $590,000. Do you remember that? A. Yes. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I'm going to object to this because I don't think any of this is inconsistent. THE COURT: Sustained. The answer earlier was that he had sold one of these properties before you add up to the amount you said, so it's not inconsistent. So I'm sustaining the objection. MR.
