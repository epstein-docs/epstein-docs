I asked her about her impressions of situations factually in hindsight. Even when we litigated expert issues around hindsight bias, there was a clear distinction made between what is obvious to a lay juror as seeing things in hindsight versus currently. I did not use any of the expert language associated with hindsight bias. So I disagree with any characterization that was somehow related to an opinion under 702. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 THE COURT: All right. Are there further questions in that regard? 13 14 MS.
