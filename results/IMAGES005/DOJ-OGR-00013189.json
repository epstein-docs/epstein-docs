The second time I had gone to Epstein's residence, Maxwell greeted me. 4 MR. PAGLIUCA: If we can direct the witness back to the third paragraph, starting with the word \"Sarah\" after the word \"Hungry.\" 7 THE WITNESS: I see what you're saying. 8 Q. Does this refresh your recollection that, in 2007, you told the FBI that Sarah was there and led her - meaning you - upstairs? 11 A. A lot of it runs together because I had gone there so many times. So I'm a little confused on the timing, because the second time I went to his residence, I did not see Sarah. 14 Q. So isn't it true, though, that that's what you told the FBI in 2007? 16 A. Obviously, because it's here. 17 Q. And you also told them, in 2007, that Sarah placed towels on the massage table; correct? 19 A. Yes, that's what it states. 20 Q. And at this second time, there is no one else there that you have told the FBI about, other than Sarah and Mr. Epstein; correct? 23 A. Yes. Maxwell was not brought up. 24 Q. It's also true that Sarah was the person who would call you from New York to schedule massages; correct? 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013189",
