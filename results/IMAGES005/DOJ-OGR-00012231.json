  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 745 Filed 08/10/22 Page 211 of 264 622 LC1Qmax6 Jane - Redirect example would be, his 3500 material is that she said that Ms. Maxwell brought girls. There was no testimony to that. There was testimony that there were women, but not that she brought them. There was testimony of her presence, but not necessarily that she told the group that everything would be okay. That's the kind of statements that are in the 3500 material. And I have addressed this with Ms. Moe. We're not entirely sure how it will come out, but it isn't a prior consistent statement. There is a prior conversation or discussion, but the statements themselves are not consistent. THE COURT: Ms. Moe. MS. MOE: Your Honor, I believe the Court's ruling on this is that we would evaluate the statements as they come out through the witness. And as a preview, after conferring with Ms. Sternheim on this issue, we did confer with Matt and asked him about what he recalls, specifically about the woman he recalls Jane telling him. Again, it's always difficult to predict the precise testimony of a lay witness, but my general expectation is that he would explain that in conversations with Jane, she explained that there was a woman at the house who made her feel comfortable; that sometimes there was that woman at the house, sometimes there were girls; and so that made her feel comfortable in the house. I don't expect that the testimony would go beyond SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012231",
