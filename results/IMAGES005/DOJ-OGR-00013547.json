As she was not endorsed, obviously, under 702, I expect that she will not use that word or give anything that sounds like an opinion along those lines. She's here as a fact witness, your Honor. And the government has agreed they don't intend to offer any opinion testimony from her.\nTHE COURT: Great. Thank you.\nMS. POMERANTZ: That all sounds accurate, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Pomerantz.\nWhat else to take up?\nMR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, if I might, I don't know if the Court wants to take this up now, but I'll just give this as a preview for later.\nThe government has endorsed Mr. Buscemi as a, as I understand it, summary witness. This is a 1006 issue. As I understand it, I don't believe that this is an appropriate summary witness under 1006. As I understand it, the purpose is to talk about testimony or pieces of evidence that have been admitted, specifically not to analyze any complex records or other business transactions or phone records or things like that. So I just wanted to give the Court a heads-up on that. I'm not exactly sure precisely what he's being offered to testify about, but I expect that there will be an objection to that testimony before it happens.\nTHE COURT: Who will I hear from?\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00013547",
