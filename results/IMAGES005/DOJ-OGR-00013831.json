I'm\n2 looking at pages 316, line 2, to page 317, line 1; pages 324\n3 line 14, to 324, line 20; and pages 323, line 23, to page 324,\n4 line 11.\n5 In those transcript paragraphs, this is Jane's\n6 testimony, she says that three things occur with respect to\n7 Ms. Maxwell and her travel:\n8 First, she says that she, Jane, traveled with\n9 Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to various locations, including New\n10 York.\n11 Second, she says that Ms. Maxwell sometimes assisted\n12 in making the travel arrangements. There's really like a one\n13 line mention of that.\n14 And third, she recounts an anecdote that on one\n15 occasion when she was already in New York, she called\n16 someone -- it's unclear who -- and she was said, quote/unquote,\n17 freaking out because she couldn't get on her plane going back\n18 to Palm Beach because she was only 15 at the time and didn't\n19 have any identification. And she says that at some point\n20 \"Ghislain made it happen for me,\" meaning that she helped her\n21 get on that flight.\n22 That's the only testimony we have and only evidence we\n23 have in the record that talks about Ms. Maxwell's involvement\n24 in enticement or encouraging travel to New York. So with\n25 respect to each three, your Honor, they are insufficient.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00013831",
