He would ask me to, like, squeeze his nipples really hard while he came. Q. Did all of the things that you just described happen on trips to New York when you were 14, 15, and 16? A. Yes. Q. You testified that you were mostly alone with him when these incidents occurred in the New York house when you were 14, 15, and 16. Just to be clear, were there times when Maxwell was present during those years? A. Yes. Q. Where would these incidents in New York typically happen within the house? A. In the massage room. Q.

Well, it was off the master bathroom, and it looked like it was maybe supposed to be a giant walk-in closet. And it was very dark.

Was there anything along the walls in the massage room? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011964",
