You are excused. (Witness excused) THE COURT: Members of the jury, we will take our mid-afternoon break. Your snacks are here. We will break for about 15 minutes. Thank you. (Jurors not present) THE COURT: You may be seated. Matters to take up before the break? MS. MODE: Not from the government, your Honor. MS. STERNHEIM: I have a matter, Judge. I believe the next witness is Matt, whose issue was teed up yesterday. In advance of his testimony, just to make sure that it is compliant with the Federal Rules of Evidence, I would request that the government give a proffer of what he is going to say, as there are things in his 3500 material that did not come out on direct examination, and it would be improper for him to be able to testify as to things that are not prior consistent statements. THE COURT: There are things in his 3500 material that the previous witness said to him -- MS. STERNHEIM: Yes. THE COURT: -- that were not asked about of the witness. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
