The government defers to\n3 the Court on the timing.\n4 THE COURT: I think from my perspective, I would like\n5 to use the jury's time on Friday, if we could. But if we\n6 can't, then I suspect they won't mind the extra time off.\n7 I'll let you know tomorrow if I can get you the charge\n8 in time to do a charging conference on Friday. But I hear you\n9 that, all things being equal, more time with the charge when\n10 you're not trying the case is helpful, I presume, for both\n11 sides.\n12 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.\n13 THE COURT: I do sometimes push for speed, you may\n14 have heard. But given where we are in the schedule, I think\n15 taking time to be careful and getting your full input,\n16 considered input, is appropriate. Okay.\n17 MR. EVERDELL: Thank you, your Honor.\n18 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.\n19 THE COURT: Am I going to get briefing on 52? Because\n20 if so, I want to schedule for it.\n21 MR. ROHRBACH: The parties haven't conferred, your\n22 Honor; but I suspect there will be briefing tonight. The\n23 government will file its brief by 8 p.m. or we can confer\n24 immediately after this, right now, your Honor, and get a\n25 timeline.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
