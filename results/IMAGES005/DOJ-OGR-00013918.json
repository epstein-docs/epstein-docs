Did he engage in any other types of giving?\n3 A. Yes.\n4 Q. What did you observe him -- what types of giving did you observe him doing?\n5 A. I know that he paid for some of the employees' kids' education. He was -- I believe that he also paid for other people's educations. He was a giver. He was generous and I always knew him to be donating to charities and just being a kind person.\n11 Q. Did Epstein ever give you any gifts?\n12 A. He did give me the massage a couple times. And, also, he had paid for a personal trainer for me to have. I guess that was a gift. I kind of thought of it more as an employee perk. I don't really think he gave me any gifts, other than when I left. My departure, I was given a watch.\n17 Q. Were there any special events he treated you to?\n18 A. Yes. That was going to The Lion King.\n19 Q. And was this the Broadway show or was this the movie?\n20 A. The Broadway show.\n21 Q. And about when did that happen?\n22 A. I believe that's when the show first came out, it was a hot ticket, and I recall him being friendly with the producer of the show. And during a time of a month or two, he was sending a lot of people to The Lion King.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
