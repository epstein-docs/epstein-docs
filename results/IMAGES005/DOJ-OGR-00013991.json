Post-event suggestion typically refers to a situation where you're supplying people with new information that is not particularly accurate. 6 Q. Memory has been termed a constructive process, correct? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. Could you explain what that means to the jury. 9 A. What we mean by that is, as I testified earlier, we don't just record events and play it back later like a recording device would work, like a video machine, but rather, we are actually constructing our memories when we retrieve memories. 13 We often take bits and pieces of experience sometimes that occurred at different times and places, bring it together, and construct what feels like a recollection. 16 Q. With regard to the experiments that you have conducted, by virtue of the experiment itself, you have proof of what would form the basis of a memory; correct? 19 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection. 20 THE COURT: Just a moment. Grounds. 21 MS. POMERANTZ: Leading. 22 THE COURT: Sustained. 23 BY MS. STERNHEIM: 24 Q. When you do memory research, is there a process in your experiment that sets up a basis for a memory? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013991",
