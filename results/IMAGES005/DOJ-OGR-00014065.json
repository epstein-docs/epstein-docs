  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 761 Filed 08/10/22 Page 206 of 246 LCGCmax6 Aznaran - direct 1 As to the relevance, I mean, for example, we see Jane's travel records going all the way up to 2010. Jane testified in this case already that she continued to travel after she had left New York and continued to travel, and I think this is, if it's already in the record, that she continued to travel. I don't think this is in any way prejudicial -- THE COURT: I just would like to know what the relevance is. MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, she also testified - Jane, I'm referring to - that she came from a family that did not have much means when she first -- when she was younger. She testified extensively about the fact that she didn't have much money, and these records show extensive foreign travel, going on well into the 2010s. So it tends to counter that. Same thing with Annie Farmer. She said she came from a family with a single mother, didn't have much money, and these travel records show travel to Mexico and places like that. For Kate, there was a discussion about she traveled after the incidents that she talked about in the United Kingdom and she was open-ended about how often she traveled and how long she traveled. And there was also testimony that she was still in contact with Jeffrey Epstein well into the 2000s. I think some of the emails are in the 2010s, 2015. So these SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
