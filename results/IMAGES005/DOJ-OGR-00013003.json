  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 751 Filed 08/10/22 Page 252 of 261 1413 LC6Cmax7 Meder - direct topless photograph of this victim. We anticipate that the testimony at this trial would be that that person recruited another victim in this case, and I believe we, in advance of trial, that our view that the person in this photograph is a victim of the charged conspiracy. In particular, other exhibits which we will offer at trial will show flight logs that will show that this person, the same person with her first and last name, traveled on flights with Maxwell and Epstein when she was 17 years old. As the Court will recall, Mr. Alessi testified that he recalled witnessing the defendant meet the same person and asked her to come to the house and give massages. So the fact that Mr. Epstein had a photograph of this person topless is corroborative of that witness testimony and consistent with the evidence at trial that this person, as a minor, was a victim of the charged conspiracy. MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, the fact that this lawyer is just now representing to this Court that this is minor is contrary, one, to the metadata on the photo that shows she was not a minor when this photograph was taken, and two, the testimony of Mr. Alessi that he met her in 2001 or 2002, also when she was not a minor. So to put in evidence a photo that they know is not her of a minor, when there is no charged crime with respect to photography in this case, your Honor, is directly contrary to the evidence as the government knows it SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
