Every last one of the government's interviews with these accusers - and there were dozens you heard - was not recorded. There is no transcript. There is no record of the exact questions that were asked or who asked what questions or whether the lawyers suggested maybe their clients had something more to add or another person to add, and that was by design so none of us have a transcript of what actually took place in these interviews with the FBI. So it was left to us, the defense, to ask the hard questions of these witnesses when they took the stand. And it's not easy to ask someone, well, that's not exactly what you said before, is it, when you told your story the first time, you didn't mention Ghislaine, and you only added that later. Why would you go decades without mentioning Ghislaine Maxwell and suddenly when you have your personal injury lawyer, you add her to the mix. The government never asked them, wait a second, you said you were traveling with Epstein and Maxwell when you were 14 and 15 years old. We have these flight logs, there's not a single record of you traveling with them when you were 14 or 15 years old. How could that be? Where did you live when this was going on? There is two different addresses and maybe we, the FBI, should go check out the house you were living in. You said you were poor, is that true? Or, where are your boots that you said they bought you?
