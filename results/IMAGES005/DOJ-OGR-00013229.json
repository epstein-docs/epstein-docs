And we have an expansive time frame here. And the question, 2000 to 2006. And then the answer again is she's only paid for May or June of 2002 to August of 2003. So we've excluded two whole years by this answer in terms of the time frame the witness testified to. THE COURT: Okay. On the time frame inconsistency, I'll allow 17, question and answer. What's next? MR. PAGLIUCA: 19 is all males who had any sexual contact with her. It says sexual assault or battery since age 10. And the answer is none. And she's testified that there were two males, I believe, that had sexual contact with her. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I believe the testimony was that they saw her naked in the massage room. I don't believe there was testimony about sexual contact. I would want to check the transcript, your Honor, but that is my recollection of the testimony. THE COURT: It's mine as well, but you'll check the transcript. In the absence of that, I don't see any inconsistency. MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, then 20 covers lewd or lascivious conduct, which would be naked people in a massage looking at a naked underage -- MS. COMEY: Again, your Honor, the testimony was just SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013229",
