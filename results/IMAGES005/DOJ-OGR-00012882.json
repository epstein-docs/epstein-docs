ROHRBACH: One matter to take up, your Honor, before the jury comes in.\n2\n3 After conferring with the defense we just wanted to make sure we fully understood the Court's ruling this morning about one piece of the testimony related to the New York search.\n4\n5 The government's understanding of the Court's ruling is that the government is not going to offer exhibits that depict either images of celebrities or images of nude or semi-nude people inside the house; but it is going to elicit testimony from the witness that she observed those two categories of images. We just want to make sure that both of those were consistent with -- both of those pieces of testimony would be consistent with the Court's ruling.\n6\n7 THE COURT: You can ask the witness testimony about what she saw at the relevant time period.\n8\n9 On the celebrity piece, I understood you to say you weren't moving in that exhibit; that is a desk with photos of Epstein with celebrities. Was that a misunderstanding?\n10\n11 MR. ROHRBACH: No, that is correct, your Honor.\n12\n13 THE COURT: I didn't rule on that, but your question is may you ask the witness about photos she saw?\n14\n15 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes. So my understanding is we're going to just ask at a relatively high level of generality, but both photos she saw and the nude artwork she observed.\n16\n17 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
