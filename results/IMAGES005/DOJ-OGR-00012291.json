I don't see how one can say that a purported\n4 address book created sometime after the end of the alleged conspiracy is a statement in furtherance of the conspiracy. We\n5 don't know, frankly, who created the book.\n6 THE COURT: Right. That's an authentication point, not a hearsay point.\n7 MR. PAGLIUCA: I understand, but I'm addressing the 801(b)(2)(E) issue as opposed to the 803(6) hearsay issue at\n8 this point. Anyway, I guess we'll see what the witness says, and then we can take it from there.\n9 THE COURT: Thank you. What else can I take up now?\n10 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think this could be addressed later in the day if the Court prefers. There are two\n11 law enforcement witnesses who will be testifying after the first three witnesses, so it's possible we will get to them\n12 today. We've had a conferral with the government. There are a number of issues we have been able to agree on. I think there\n13 are a few that we don't. We can take that up now or we can do that later in the day.\n14 MS.
