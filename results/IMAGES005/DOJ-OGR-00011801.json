And while Ms. Drescher puts this up for the jury, Mr. Visoski, would you please tell us what we see in this photograph. A. As far as describing the home or the property? Q. Yes. Could you tell us what we see in the top right-hand corner first and then tell us what we're seeing on the property. A. Oh, gotcha. The top right-hand corner was the boat dock, if you were to arrive by boat. So that was the entrance for guests to arrive by boat. And then if you continued down the highway there, you can't see the helipad, the helipad is still south of that structure. Once you were there, you could take -- you would walk up to the main house up on the top of the hill. Q. Thank you. MS. COMEY: We can take that down.
