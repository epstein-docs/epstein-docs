I think the government has their copy. THE COURT: I have it on paper. Q. So, Mr. Rodgers, if you just take a look at that. I'm going to direct your attention specifically to the second full paragraph. It's towards the end, but why don't you read that whole paragraph. It's right in the middle of the page. THE COURT: Read to himself. Q. Yes, read to yourself. I'm sorry. A. Okay. Q. Mr. Rodgers, I'll ask you, does reading that refresh your recollection that it was your impression that Sarah Kellen took over as Epstein's primary assistant in the late 2000s -- sorry, in late 2001? A. I didn't see Sarah's name mentioned in here. Q. Are you referring to 35 -- it's tab 4. THE COURT: I think -- it wasn't clear what page you were directing to. Q. I'm sorry. I direct you to page 2 of 3, if that wasn't clear, sir. A. I didn't hear that. Page 2? Q. I'm sorry, why don't we try this again. If you could refer to page 2. A. Okay. Q. It's the second full paragraph. Just read that paragraph. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013458",
