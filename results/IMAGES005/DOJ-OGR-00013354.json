So I don't think that anyone can actually say that there is a practice or methodology associated with these exhibits. MS. MOE: Your Honor, on that subject, because the messages are ordered sequentially, the rule only requires that the record is made at or near the time of the offense recorded, and because the dates and times are sequential, even when a message doesn't have a date or time, it's situated between sequentially ordered messages, which is how the record itself shows that these are sequentially kept messages that are kept at or near the time of those events. They are in chronological order and that's all that the rule requires. MR. PAGLIUCA: I disagree with that, as well, your Honor, because when I'm going through these, again, there are some that have dates on them and then there are some that have dates out of order on them, and then there are a bunch that don't have dates on them. There is no one that can establish a particular practice of using the same book at the same time. It is common knowledge, I think, for people who were using these books when they were used, you can take any six different books and start writing in them at any point in time to take a message. MS. MOE: Your Honor, the point here is that employees were instructed to take messages from phone calls as they came in. Mr. Pagliuca's point is to weight and not authenticity or SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013354",
