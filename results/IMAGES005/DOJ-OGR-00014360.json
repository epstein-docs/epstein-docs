THE COURT: I presume you have no objection? MR. EVERDELL: No objection, your Honor. THE COURT: Yes. Let me just think about that. I see. Okay. All right. So Instruction 36, line 21, changing \"Carolyn was under the age of 18\" to \"the age of 17.\" Yeah, that's right. Okay. Next. MR. EVERDELL: Next one, lines, on that page, 23 to 24, and on the following page, lines 1 through 10, it tracks the same changes for the transportation charge. MR. ROHRBACH: That makes sense, I think, your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. Let me see if I can do these. Line 24, changing \"age of 18\" to \"age of 17,\" and then line 2, changing \"age of 18\" to 17. Line 4, cutting the clause \"when Annie was under the age of 18,\" and then cutting overt act regarding Kate at No. 4. So that's lines 6 through 8. And then line 19, changing 18 to 17. MR. EVERDELL: Correct, your Honor. MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, you would also want to change the bracketed No. 5 to No. 4. THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Sternheim. Changing the fifth listed overt act to the fourth listed overt act. Just SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014360",
