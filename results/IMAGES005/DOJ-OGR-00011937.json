And the Yorkie came by us and we asked if we could pet the dog. Q. What happened then? A. We started chitchatting, petted the dog. And the rest of my classmates had to go to class. And probably about a minute later, another man came and joined her. Q. Once the man joined her, what happened next? A. We continued chitchat, sort of talked to us. And the rest of my friends, my classmates, left, and I was there by myself. And I sat on the bench still eating my ice cream, and the man sat across from me. Q. Did you have a conversation with that man and that woman? A. Yes, I did. He seemed very interested to know what I thought about the camp, what my favorite classes were, what my least favorite classes, teachers, whatnot, what the experience was like. And proceeded to say that they were big benefactors of this camp; and that they went there every summer; and that they gave different kids scholarships. And so they wanted to really know what a student attending the camp, what their perspective was on it. Q. What, if anything, else did you discuss with them? A. Well, they asked me where I was from. And I said I lived in Palm Beach, Florida. And the man said, What a coincidence, we live there too. What are your parents' names? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011937",
