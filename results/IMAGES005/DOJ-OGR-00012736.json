EVERDELL: Your Honor, Sergeant Dawson was the police officer who took Juan Alessi's confession after the burglary. He came into the precinct, Sergeant Dawson Mirandized him and took his statement. Juan Alessi denied making some of the statements that we think are clearly reflected in Sergeant Dawson's report. 8 Among other things, he denied going in twice to steal the money. It's as clearly in the reports that he went in twice and stole money on two occasions. The first occasion he was going to try to steal the gun, he didn't find the gun, said he took money. He went back several weeks later and stole more. I think we're entitled to impeach or to point out and elicit the prior inconsistent statement of Juan Alessi through this witness. 16 MR. ROHRBACH: This is an entirely collateral matter, your Honor. Whether Mr. Alessi went once or twice to steal $6,300 only goes to his character for truthfulness or at beast, also possibly impeachment by contradiction. But in either sense, it's totally collateral to any of the central issues of this trial. They would not be able to independently prove up any of these facts but for Mr. Alessi having testified. 23 MR. EVERDELL: It was a Mirandized statement, your Honor. Mr. Alessi put his credibility directly at issue about these very statements when he said, I am going to tell the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012736",
