MENNINGER: For that reason, having her explain what sexualized means when I wasn't allowed to elicit to the agents that it wasn't sexualized is what gives me concern. THE COURT: The record stands and you inquired. I didn't prohibit you from asking her, I didn't let her explain what sexualized means either. I've made my record and the record stands as it is. You can't go back in time. MS. MENNINGER: That's right. THE COURT: What is the issue? Should I send the jury for a break or? MS. STERNHEIM: If this would probably be a good time for a break before they call him, but I can make it very quickly. THE COURT: Go ahead. MS. STERNHEIM: It's my understanding that Dave Mulligan is being called as a witness for prior inconsistent statements. THE COURT: Right. MS. STERNHEIM: The 3500 material that has been provided far exceeds the testimony of this witness, and I just want to make sure that it is not going to exceed as far as prior consistent what she's testified to. MS. POMERANTZ: I'm happy to consult with Ms. Sternheim on a break. My plan is to ask specific questions that would be consistent with what she's testified about. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
