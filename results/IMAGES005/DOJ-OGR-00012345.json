We know that younger -- the younger someone is, the more likely they are to delay disclosure; in other words, the less likely they are to tell someone right away about what's happening to them.\n3 Q. And when you say \"the younger,\" how does that compare in terms of children?\n4 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less likely to disclose. And most children, in fact, we know don't tell anyone about the abuse that they've experienced until adulthood.\n5 Q.

There are a number of factors.\n9 Delayed disclosure is such a common -- commonly recognized phenomenon within the literature that now we are doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to disclosure because, of course, we would like children to be able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped.
