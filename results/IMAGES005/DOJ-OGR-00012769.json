MR. ROHRBACH: The government wouldn't object to the question, is your attorney in the courtroom today. It's the additional, what is the name of your attorney, can you point out your attorney to the jury, those questions the government thinks has no relevance. THE COURT: I agree. Are you represented, is your attorney here, I've certainly seen witnesses testify with their attorney in the room. So beyond that, what's the relevance of the attorney -- MS. STERNHEIM: The relevance is that this is an attorney who sat through the proffer sessions with her, this is the attorney who was instrumental in starting the Epstein Fund, this is an attorney who has written about her while this case is pending in his own book. There is a tremendous amount of handling that is going on and I think the jury is entitled to know that. THE COURT: How is that information going to -- MS. STERNHEIM: I'm going to ask her questions about, the book is public, she's in the book. I think that she has agreed to have her story put in a book, not in her own name, and I'm not going to make reference to her name, but I think all of these things are fair game. There are many other topics that I will be raising prior to my cross examination. This is SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012769",
