Therefore, I instruct you not to consider punishment or possible punishment in any way in your deliberations in this case. Instruction No. 59: Right to Hear Testimony; Election of Foreperson; Communications with the Court; Juror Note-Taking. You're about to go into the jury room and begin your deliberations. The documentary evidence will be sent back with you. If you want any of the testimony read to you, that can be arranged, but please remember that it's not always easy to locate or you might want to be as specific as you possibly can in requesting portions of the testimony that you might want. Your first task as a jury will be to choose your foreperson. The foreperson has no greater voice or authority than any other juror, but is the person who will communicate with the Court through written note when questions arise and to indicate when you've reached your verdict. Your request for testimony - in fact, any communications with the Court - should be made to me in writing, signed by your foreperson, by number, and given to one of the marshals outside the jury room. I'll respond to any questions or requests you have as promptly as possible, either SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014646",
