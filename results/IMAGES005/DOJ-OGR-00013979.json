And have you testified with regard to the construction or reconstruction of memory? 3 A. Yes. 4 5 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, at this time, I would proffer 6 Professor Elizabeth Loftus as an expert in the field of memory science, the nature of memory reconstruction, and the impact of events upon memory. 7 8 MS. POMERANTZ: Subject to our earlier objections, 9 your Honor. 10 11 THE COURT: Consistent with my prior ruling, I 12 indicate Professor Loftus as an expert in the fields you've indicated. Go ahead. 13 14 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you very much. 15 16 BY MS. STERNHEIM: 17 Q. Professor Loftus, I just mentioned stages of memory. Can you please explain to the jury what those stages are in the study of memory science. 18 19 A. Yes. One of the things we know about memory is it doesn't work like a recording device. You don't just record the event and play it back later. The process is much more complex. And we study the processes of memory, tend to divide that process into three major stages. 20 21 22 THE WITNESS: And, your Honor, I don't know if it's possible in this enclosure for me to illustrate this for the 23 24 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013979",
