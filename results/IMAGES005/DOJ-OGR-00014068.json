MENNINGER: Your Honor, may I raise one issue? 3 Your Honor gave us a 5 o'clock extension of filing of a brief today. Can I ask for one hour so that we could -- until 6:00 p.m. for that filing so we can confer with our office? 4 5 THE COURT: Okay. 6 7 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you. 8 THE COURT: I don't even know what it is. I'll still be here at 6:00. That will be fine. 9 10 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, just one thing to alert the Court. I believe the parties have reached, in principle, agreement on a stipulation regarding Mr. Glassman. So that will obviate the need to deal with the service issue for his live testimony. 11 12 13 THE COURT: Sounds like a good idea. 14 15 MR. PAGLIUCA: It could have been fun, your Honor. 16 17 THE COURT: If only someone had thought of that sooner. 18 19 The witness is coming back and we can bring in the jury. Thank you for working out agreement on the timeframe issue. 20 21 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. 22 23 (Witness present) 24 THE COURT: You may take a seat and you can remove your mask. Just waiting for the jury. 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014068",
