EVERDELL: I'm not saying an investigative technique per se, your Honor. I'm simply pointing out that evidence that a jury might expect to see, given we are in the modern era, is not present in front of them because of the age of the allegations. So I think this point through the agent clarifies the fact that these records don't exist anymore, they tried to get them, I think, and they didn't exist. It's not a particular technique, it's just highlighting the fact that, in a case of this age, there are records that have disappeared, phone records get deleted after a while, there is no such thing as geo location information, there weren't cellphones that had these things. So pointing it out to the agent is simply pointing out the absence of evidence because there wouldn't be anything in the record to argue that to the jury if I'm not allowed to put that in front of -- through this agent.
