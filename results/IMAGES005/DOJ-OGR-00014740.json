The answer has three parts to it. So the first part is, \"They just kind of went their separate ways.\" The question \"How so?\" is not objected to, so that stays, at the least. The answer, \"They just kind of went their separate ways.\" Seems like Ghislaine\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014740",
