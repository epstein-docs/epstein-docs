We haven't\n3 heard anything from the jury, so I think it is time to consider\n4 putting in a note regarding tomorrow since we don't have a\n5 response on that. So the note I have drafted, with your input,\n6 let me know, \"Hello, jury. If your deliberations are not\n7 completed today, do you wish to deliberate tomorrow, Thursday,\n8 December 23rd?\" And then I have a box for \"yes\" and a box for\n9 \"no.\" \"Please check yes or no. If yes, what time would you\n10 like to deliberate from? Blank a.m. to blank p.m. Judge\n11 Nathan.\"\n12 Any thoughts or requests?\n13 MS. COMEY: Seems perfect.\n14 MS. STERNHEIM: Fine. Thank you.\n15 THE COURT: What I'll do is we'll send that in and I\n16 think everybody just wait, my assumption is it will come right\n17 back out and we'll reconvene. I'll see you in a moment.\n18 (Recess)\n19 THE COURT: As that went in, a note came out. So I\n20 don't have a response yet, but I have a note.\n21 \"May we please have the following testimonies in a\n22 binder.\" The first one is Jane, Wong, Kate. There is\n23 something else written next to Jane.\n24 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I'm not reading the note, but\n25 they got Jane. It wasn't in a binder.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
