All I have is a letter from the lawyers saying that they have a defense subpoena and their witness would invoke. If the request is that you want the witness to come and invoke formally outside the presence of the jury, we can do that. If the request is some substitution for that, confer with the government and make a proposal to the Court.\n2 Okay. What else?\n3 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I've conferred with the government a couple times on redactions. I tried that yesterday, I tried it again this morning. I don't have an answer back yet from them, but I hope we can have one soon on some of the exhibits that are outstanding. That's something else that's outstanding.\n4 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor, we've been trading views on redactions. We'll finalize them and submit them to the Court shortly.\n5 THE COURT: Yes, Ms. Sternheim?\n6 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I wanted to inform the Court, as the government is aware --\n7 THE COURT: I'm not sure your mic is on.\n8 MS. STERNHEIM: Now it is. There were technical issues with regard to providing testimony from Mr. Hamilton in England, and we viewed it to be just far too complicated.\n9 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
