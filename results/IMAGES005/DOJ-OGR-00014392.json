ROHRBACH: The government has just one edit, if\n4 Mr. Everdell is finished on the other.\n5 MR. EVERDELL: Which one?\n6 MR. ROHRBACH: Which is on the top of the verdict\n7 sheet. After \"please indicate your verdict with a checkmark,\"\n8 it's a \"T\" in parentheses.\n9 THE COURT: That's so odd. Yes. We'll convert that\n10 to a checkmark.\n11 OK. That's it from the verdict sheet?\n12 MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing from the government.\n13 MR. EVERDELL: Nothing from the defense, your Honor.\n14 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I have something unrelated to\n15 the charge in the verdict sheet.\n16 THE COURT: All right. Give me one moment just to go\n17 through my to do list. So I have two open issues that I'll\n18 hear from the government by letter by 2. Once I have that,\n19 I'll make my conclusions with respect to those. We'll send the\n20 parties a redline version of the changes made and a clean\n21 version, which will be the final version, unless -- I'll set a\n22 time when I send it to you, by a certain time. You indicate\n23 any errors that were implemented in the implementation of the\n24 changes. Otherwise that will be final.
