Again, she doesn't mention that Epstein is providing her any support or paying for her to go. By this point, in her budding career, she has been in commercials, she has been in a Broadway production of Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat on the touring group that came to Palm Beach. She's got more prestigious letters of recommendation, still no application for financial aid, still no mention of Epstein. And after her second year at Interlochen, we see her customs and border protection records which show how many times when she was a teen that she was traveling internationally. This person who said she didn't have lunch money, she's going to Italy for an international trip she told you about, a vocal competition with her school. And she's going on an international trip to Europe with her family to see other family back there. And in 1996, she applies for Interlochen again. And on that one, they actually go so far as to ask her, in this yellow highlighted area, not only are you applying for financial aid, which she says no, but does the student expect to be the recipient of any funds from any individual specifically for attendance at Interlochen Arts Camp, and she says no, while she came in here and told you that Epstein was paying for her.
