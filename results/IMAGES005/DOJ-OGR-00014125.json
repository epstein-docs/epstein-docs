Anything else before we take that up?\n\n3 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor.\n\n4 THE COURT: Anything else to take up before?\n\n5 MS. MENNINGER: I'm trying to get in touch with someone from the office, your Honor.\n\n6 THE COURT: Defense seeks to admit extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement under 613(b), which requires that, quote, the witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement and an adverse party is given an opportunity to examine the witness about it.\n\n7 My colleague, Judge Kaplan, in the Gulani (ph.) case, hopefully laid out the proper steps of the analysis.\n\n8 First, the Court must determine whether the proffered statement, in fact, is inconsistent with the testimony sought to be impeached. The test is whether there is any variance between the statement and the testimony that has a reasonable bearing on credibility.\n\n9 Actually, I just thought of something, a question, Ms. Menninger.
