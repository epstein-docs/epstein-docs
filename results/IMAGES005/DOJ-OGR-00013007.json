And I think putting on a photograph like that without any supporting testimony about when it was taken, the circumstances under which it was taken is highly, unduly prejudicial.\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, defense counsel is grasping at straws here. This exhibit is plainly relevant. It's consistent with other trial exhibits and I do take issue with the suggestion that I made any misrepresentation with the Court. I certainly have not done that and would not do that, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: 332, the objection is overruled. 309.\nMS. MOE: Sorry. With respect to 309, that person is the person who testified this morning as Kate. I unfortunately haven't reviewed the final information recently, so I don't want to make a representation to the Court and it becomes an issue. We're happy to examine it and report to the Court this evening. My memory is the file name for this is her first name.\nMS. MENNINGER: And the date was 2002 when she was 25. And she didn't get on the stand and talk about photographs being taken of her. I mean, she didn't mention it. So now we're going to put in a photograph after she's left the stand.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00013007",
