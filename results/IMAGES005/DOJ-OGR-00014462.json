I expect Judge Nathan will instruct\n8 you that a conspiracy just means an agreement to break the law.\n9 The crime is the agreement and taking some step to carry it\n10 out. So the question for you here is, did Maxwell agree with\n11 Epstein to commit these crimes. The conspiracy counts are\n12 counts One, Three, and Five.\n13 The first two conspiracy counts are from 1994 to 2004.\n14 Those counts are about Jane, Carolyn, and Annie. Those counts\n15 charge a conspiracy related to enticement and travel, as we've\n16 just discussed. We've already talked about how Maxwell and\n17 Epstein completed these crimes as to Jane. For the conspiracy\n18 charges, even though Carolyn and Annie were not sexually abused\n19 in New York, everything about the defendant's and Epstein's\n20 interactions with those girls makes it clear that that is what\n21 they both intended. Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as\n22 part of a broader agreement with Epstein to provide him with\n23 underage girls for abuse.
