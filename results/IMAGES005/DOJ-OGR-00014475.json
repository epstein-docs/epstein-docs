Wait until you hear the remainder of the arguments to come, my instructions, and you begin your deliberations. And continue to keep an open mind until we get through all of the stages of the case. Enjoy your brief lunch. We'll see you in 20 to 30 minutes. Thank you. (Jury not present) THE COURT: Any matters to take up? MS. COMEY: No, your Honor. MS. STERNHEIM: One brief matter, Judge. THE COURT: Okay. MS. STERNHEIM: And I preface this by saying that I haven't had an opportunity to research it, but during the closing argument, Ms. Moe indicated that because a massage table came from California, that affects interstate commerce. It is not my understanding that that is accurate. If that were the case, then any dwelling that contained any property that had come out of state would have affected interstate commerce. There is no evidence that the table was purchased, when it was purchased, and whether it was purchased in connection with the offenses charged. It is unlike the cases where property is stolen, and that property is for resale and affects interstate commerce. This is not that situation, and I think that the statement is incorrect. THE COURT: Application? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014475",
