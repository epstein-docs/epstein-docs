POMERANTZ: My understanding, your Honor, of what she's going to say is that she didn't want to talk about it; that something had happened. There are times where she has used that word. In our several last meetings she has not used that word. But she has said, I didn't want to get into details with my mom. I told her something had happened. MS. MENNINGER: The quote in discovery is, I told her I wasn't raped, and I don't want this to ruin my life. So I'm a little worried about the \"rape\" word being used by the witness in this context, especially because we've litigated extensively that consent and -- MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, the defense has put the memory of the witnesses, of the victims, at issue from the start at their opening, and they are incentitives. THE COURT: I'm overruling. It's an anticipated prior consistent statement based on the clear attack on the credibility of the allegations of all of the alleged victims. We'll see what comes. A statement that she wasn't raped is not suggesting that she was raped; that's suggesting the opposite. MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, if I might add, it's the use of the word and knowing how inflammatory it is and the restrictions put on it to now allow them to even suggest, that is extremely loaded and extraordinarily prejudicial. This has nothing to do with the opening with regard to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013657",
