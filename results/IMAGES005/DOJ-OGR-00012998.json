There has been witness testimony about the timeframe of that relationship, that it began in the early '90s. I think the defense has argued that that terminated during certain time periods. But, in short, I think all of Ms. Menninger's arguments are arguments that they are free to make to the jury but have nothing to do with the question of relevance. These items have been thoroughly authenticated and to the extent the defense wants to offer witnesses about their metadata and make arguments to the jury about what that means or what it doesn't mean, that's for the defense to put before the jury. It has nothing to do with the question of authentication or relevance, which are both low bars that are easily cleared here. THE COURT: So the authentication is these items -- these represent the items that were found in the home during the 2019 search and the relevance is that they show the relationship between Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Throughout the course of these photographs. I would note, your Honor, with respect to the concern about metadata, it happens often in criminal trials that electronic evidence is seized, authenticated as such, and offered before the jury. If it were the case that evidence could only be admitted in court if the people who wrote the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012998",
