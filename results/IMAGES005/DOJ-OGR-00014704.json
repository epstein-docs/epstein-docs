EVERDELL: Right?\n2 The travel back to a place where she is presumably not engaging in illicit sexual activity, that is not a significant or motivating purpose for that travel.\n3 THE COURT: You didn't answer my question.\n4 MR. EVERDELL: Maybe I'm confused by the question, your Honor.\n5 THE COURT: To be found guilty on this count, must the jury conclude that she aided in the transportation of Jane's flight to New Mexico?\n6 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, may I interject myself into this conversation?\n7 THE COURT: If you answer the question, I would value it.\n8 MS. MENNINGER: I will.\n9 It has to be a place for which the travel was a significant or motivating purpose for illegal sexual activity.\n10 In this hypothetical that they've given in this question, they have a comma in two places. The first place they have a comma is after the return flight, comma, but not the flight to New Mexico, where the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity, comma. So they have excluded out where they're hypothetically claiming that the flight to New Mexico was the place for which the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n11 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
