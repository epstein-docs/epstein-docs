MENNINGER: I think Mr. Everdell was going to\n12 handle that piece.\n13 THE COURT: Okay.\n14 Ms. Comey, are you taking this?\n15 MR. ROHRBACH: I'm taking this one, your Honor.\n16 THE COURT: You all swapped off.\n17 So I think the defense is clearly right that if we are\n18 talking by impeachment by contradiction, that is to say,\n19 impeachment, direct contradiction of something testified to on\n20 the stand, it's not required to be disclosed as case-in-chief\n21 material under Rule 16; and depending on what it is, it's\n22 likely not 608 because it's impeachment by contradiction, not\n23 impeachment to show -- extrinsic evidence to show a character\n24 for dishonesty and the like.\n25 So the question is whether it's impeachment or not.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00012022",
