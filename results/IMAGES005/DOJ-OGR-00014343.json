But they\n6 can correct me if I'm wrong about that.\n7\n8 MR. ROHRBACH: I believe that Jane only testified as\n9 to one sexual incident of sexual abuse in New Mexico and that\n10 that was reflected in the 3500 material. I think Ms. Pomerantz\n11 is looking for it, but it should not have been a surprise to\n12 the defense.\n13 THE COURT: Yeah. I mean, the problem -- the\n14 instructions are accurate. It's clear it's a violation of New\n15 York law. This was the government's argument for not giving\n16 the limiting instructions that I gave with respect to Annie and\n17 Kate, but I did give those instructions. It sounds like maybe\n18 there was an instance in which the defense might have requested\n19 one following a particular piece of testimony. To add that\n20 now, having not -- well, let me put it this way. Having not\n21 asked for a limiting instruction then I don't think provides a\n22 basis for inclusion of limiting instructions, repetition of\n23 limiting instructions in the charge, and even without it, which\n24 was the government's original argument, it's clear that the\n25 violation of law is as charged in New York. So I'm not\npersuaded to include it. I'm not persuaded to include it.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00014343",
