I won't read the rest, your Honor. The rest is as is. MS. COMEY: That's fine with us, your Honor. THE COURT: Great. I accept that and will give that -- and I propose that the timing would be the same as with the prior witness with the limiting instruction? MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. MR. EVERDELL: Sorry. One more moment, your Honor. We have agreement again, your Honor. THE COURT: It's a magical moment. MR. EVERDELL: It is a magical moment. I agree with you. Let's hold onto this. So the changes I read remain, but I will read the first sentence again. \"I anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about physical contact that she says she had with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell in New Mexico. I instruct you that the alleged physical contact she says occurred with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell in New Mexico was not illegal sexual activity.\" The rest is the same. MS. COMEY: That's fine with us, your Honor. THE COURT: Great. Thank you. That makes good sense. On this issue, and there is a 412 issue that we had discussed -- let me talk to you at sidebar, that goes to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013409",
