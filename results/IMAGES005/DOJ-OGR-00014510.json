She gave you a description of the Palm Beach house. She said this massage room that she went to hundreds of times, hundreds of times was in the massage room that was off the master bathroom, and that the house itself had creepy looking animals. We all sat through the floor plan discussion that went on and on, and you know what, there's not a massage room off the master bathroom. 15 The master bathroom was the massage room. So if she had been there hundreds of times, do you think she would have gotten that wrong? 18 She said it had a light beachy feel. It was light because it was off the master bathroom and it had like a beachy feel. What was in the room, I don't think I saw anything past the massage table. You recall a massage room that was attached to the bathroom, correct, that's my memory, yes. We saw the room attached to the bathroom, it's a closet. We saw the floor plan. There is no massage room off the master bathroom. And we saw the bathroom, which is hardly a light beachy feel with SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014510",
