It's his goddaughter. But if the jury sees a photo like this, they may draw some inappropriate assumptions about his proclivities, and we think this should be excluded on relevance and 403 ground prejudice.\n7 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think it would make sense to take this up with another exhibit from the same witness because our arguments are the same as to both.\n10 With respect to Government Exhibit 296, which is the walk-through video, it's about a 40-minute video, I don't expect to play all of it for the jury, but in the walk-through, you can see that when walking from the top of the staircase on the second floor through the anteroom into the master bedroom, that prominently displayed is the photograph displayed in Government Exhibit 270, which your Honor excluded. It is briefly shown on the screen, but in context, it's clear that it is the primary decoration right outside of the master bedroom that the defendant shared with Mr. Epstein. So, I would like to take that exhibit up at the same time because I think the arguments are the same.\n22 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor. I can address that.\n24 THE COURT: Okay.\n25 MR. EVERDELL: So as Ms. Comey said, when we do the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
