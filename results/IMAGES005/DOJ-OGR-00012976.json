This is a photograph that's taken in an office near the front of the residence. This was a wooden bookcase and cabinets that were located in that office. This particular photograph depicts the bottom cabinet open where my team located several plastic bins that contained boxes of hard drives. The boxes in this photograph also had evidence tape that were on the exterior of the boxes. MS. MOE: Ms. Drescher, if you could please up pull up for the witness, counsel, and the Court, Government Exhibit 935R. Q. Is that the same photograph just redacted? A. Yes, ma'am, it is. MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government offers Government Exhibit 935R as a public exhibit. MR. EVERDELL: No objection. THE COURT: 935R is admitted. You may publish. (Government's Exhibit 935R received in evidence) MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. Q. Now that we're taking a look at Government Exhibit 935R, I believe you were describing the items in this cabinet. Let me just take a step back and ask, the room that we're looking at in this photograph, where was that within the house? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012976",
