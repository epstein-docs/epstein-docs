  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 761 Filed 08/10/22 Page 19 of 246 2314 LCGVMAX1 believes to be an example of suggestion. This testimony provides a sufficient basis for the jury to consider the relevance of Dr. Loftus's opinions on suggestive questioning techniques. So that's my basis for that ruling. There was argument regarding Agent Young testimony that -- I don't know the government's general views on Agent Young's testimony and I don't need to reach a conclusion on that for purposes of this ruling. So I don't have further guidance on that now. All right. Questions on that? MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing from the government, your Honor. MS. STERNHEIM: Nothing at this time. THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. All right. Motion to preclude Alexander Hamilton testimony. MS. STERNHEIM: We'd like to get Broadway tickets for everyone. That's the best we can do. THE COURT: It really is -- yes. It was Hamilton in Federal '78 that said, We just have judgment, not will nor force, just judgment. So I guess this calls for judgment. So I have the defense response with respect to this witness that came in at 12:31 a.m. this morning. I haven't had a chance to work through the issue yet. What's the timing on this witness? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013878",
