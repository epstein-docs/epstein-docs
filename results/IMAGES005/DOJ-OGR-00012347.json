And that research has repeatedly demonstrated that when people -- when you ask people if they acknowledge that they've been abused, particularly sexually abused, during childhood, and then you ask them if they ever told anyone, a significant number will say no, not until this interview. And then others will say yes, and then they are asked when they've told. And we know from the research that often they don't tell until adulthood.\nQ. In your clinical and forensic practices, have you treated and evaluated patients who did not disclose sexual abuse they experienced as children, but disclosed such abuse later?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Without getting into any particular anecdotes of your practices, can you explain.\nA. I'm sorry, can you repeat the question.\nQ. Yes. Can you just explain -- let me ask it this way: In your own clinical practice, how common, if at all, is it for you to be the first person your patients have told they were abused?\nMR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I'm going to object to this as not being relevant.\nTHE COURT: Overruled. Thank you.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00012347",
