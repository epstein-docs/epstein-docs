They then had five full days, including three business days, to prepare. So we would object to holding the case over to Monday for a new witness.\n2\n3\n4\n5 MR. EVERDELL: This is a witness that is extraordinarily relevant and sometimes things develop during trial and we need to get witnesses to address issues that come up at trial. We were able to find this person and he's willing to come, even those he's 81, because he wants to come and provide this testimony if it's required.\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11 This is extraordinarily relevant, especially with the issue that came up with the property records and the issue raised to the Court. He can directly speak to that issue. His testimony is relevant for a critical issue in this case, which is whether or not this -- the events that Kate described could have even taken place at the time they took place, which she alleges they took place in, and he should be heard.\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I just note this is the defense's third bite of this particular apple and it emphasizes the prejudice to us of delayed disclosure. We will have no opportunity to investigate further at this point.\n19\n20\n21\n22 THE COURT: I mean, what we talked about yesterday was inclusion of documents that show ownership; right?\n23\n24 MR. EVERDELL: That's correct, your Honor.\n25 THE COURT: And I think I said those could come in.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014117",
