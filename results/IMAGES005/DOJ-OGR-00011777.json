The juror is, I think, more concerned about the spouse's reaction. At one point, they did say, \"If I have to proceed, I can. I understand.\" On the other hand, they mentioned some level of distraction and concern.\nSo, I'll hear your suggestion.\nMR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I understood that the Court was going to -- there were two options the Court was considering. One was seeing if the juror could change plans, and if that didn't work, the Court was considering breaking for the juror's anticipated vacation. That's what I understood the Court to say.\nIf the juror can't change the plans, our preference would be, not frankly that we want to delay the trial, but my preference would be to keep the juror and accommodate the juror's travel plans, your Honor.\nMS. COMEY: Your Honor, the government's preference would be to keep the trial moving, keep the trial days as scheduled, and excuse the juror if those days become necessary for this case.\nTHE COURT: Just to be clear about what we're talking about. So given the holiday, we're not going to sit the 23rd\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00011777",
