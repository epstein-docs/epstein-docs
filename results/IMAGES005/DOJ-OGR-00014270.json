MOE: Your Honor, on Friday evening, the defense produced the Kinnerton Street records to the government. The next day, we produced the deposition in which Ms. Maxwell made that statement. Of course, it's Ms. Maxwell's own deposition and it's also a public record.\n4\n5 THE COURT: Right. I mean, it comes in. I don't see any basis it doesn't come in. The question is --\n6\n7 MS. MOE: Your Honor, with respect to the deposition, just so the record is clear, it's only being offered to rebut this last minute registry issue. There is no -- to the extent defense counsel is arguing they need to call this witness to rebut an inference from the government, I want to be clear it's only because the defense is putting this at issue. We would be happy to just rest here and not make this an issue at all. The reason that there is a purported need for this is, again, because the defense is inviting this issue at this late hour.\n8\n9 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if the government is willing to stipulate to just putting in the property records showing the title ownership without the deposition transcript, we're willing to do that, we won't need the extra witness. If they're going to put in the deposition transcript and make that an issue, we feel like we need the other witness to be able to counter that.\n10\n11 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
