EVERDELL: I think that's right, your Honor.\n\nLet's give an example, because I think it's helpful to use examples. I'll use one from this very case.\n\nIt's my understanding that the government wants to introduce certain FedEx records through a FedEx document custodian. The defense also would like to introduce other FedEx records, coincidentally, through the same document custodian. So if that happens, you'd have a witness called by the government, the defense would want to introduce affirmative proof in its case through that same witness. That would be defense case-in-chief material which, by the way, we disclosed in our Rule 16 letter to the government. That's an example, I think, where the courts are talking about where you disclose things -- where you have a witness where you are trying to put on affirmative proof in the defense case through the government's witness. That is an example where we don't dispute.\n\nI'll give another example. This is a hypothetical one. Larry Visoski just testified.
