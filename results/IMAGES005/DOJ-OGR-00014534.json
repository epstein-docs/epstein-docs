And Jane came from a prominent musical family with supportive brothers and sisters and a mom and two older siblings as well. She had a singing and acting career, and there's no evidence whatsoever that Ghislaine Maxwell's chitchat with her, as she called it, was grooming. The government brought you these pilots. But the pilots said they didn't see anyone underage. And nothing ever once hinted to them that there was sexual activity going on with underage girls. You heard Larry Visoski talk about how he left his daughters -- he was happy to have his daughters go horseback riding with Ghislaine Maxwell all the time. You heard from the FedEx records custodian, Tracy Chapell was her name. And again, she told you that there were no packages from Ghislaine Maxwell to Carolyn or any other underage girls. The government only showed you a few that went to Carolyn, but she had gathered hundreds, and we provided with you the rest of those, which just show that Ghislaine Maxwell sent FedExes to her family. Not one of the accusers got a package from Ghislaine Maxwell. The government brought you some law enforcement specialists. Kelly Maguire said she searched the 71st Street residence and located hundreds of hard drives and tons of photographs. Kimberly Meder said she scoured those 40,000 photos, and all they came up with were some old SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014534",
