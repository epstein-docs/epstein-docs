Thank you.\n\nAny final points, Mr. Everdell?\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Just two, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: Microphone, please.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: I can do it from here.\n\nTHE COURT: That's fine.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: The point about Mr. Epstein's actions I\nwon't leave alone; but, of course, only applies to the\nconspiracy count. Obviously Count Two is the substantive\ncount.\n\nTHE COURT: You'll address aiding and abetting?\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Well, yes, aiding and abetting. So I\ndon't see any testimony of Ghislaine Maxwell aiding and\nabetting Jeffrey Epstein, enticing her to travel to New York.\nThere's remarkably little testimony about that action, and that\nis what the subject of the substantive count is, right. You\nhave to show that Ms. Maxwell enticed Jane to travel to New\nYork with the intent knowing that when she got there, that\nstatute, that New York statute that's cited in the indictment,\nwould be violated.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00013836",
