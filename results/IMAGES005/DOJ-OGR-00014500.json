And you should take a look at those, because Epstein went every year, pretty much, including with Itzhak Perlman, a famous musician himself. And not only did Epstein and Maxwell go to Interlochen in '94, they also went in '96. And actually, they both went in 1996. And so, while they claim the flight log from '94 establishes that Jane met Epstein and Maxwell in '94, in fact, it's just as possible that she met them in '96. And if she met them in '96, it certainly makes a lot more sense given the rest of the evidence, which we'll talk about now.\n2 Because the next thing that happened is there is a flight in November of 1996 which the government showed you, and I'll show you again in a minute, that has Jane going on a flight from Palm Beach, when she's 16, to New York. That's the very first time someone with Jane's first name flies on a flight, when she's 16, while she came and told you all that she was flying repeatedly when she was 14 and 15, but there is no records, miraculously, of those flights.\n3 In March of 1997, Jane and her mother, when she's 16, file a lawsuit against her voice teacher, her principal, and her guidance counselor. That lawsuit went on for two years. Jane said she remembered her teacher pulling her hair one time, but she had no idea that her mother and she had sued her own principal, guidance counselor, and voice teacher. Is that credible, that a 16-year-old doesn't know she's in litigation\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014500",
