Is it fair to say that she was frequently in the room while you were being sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein when you were 14, 15, and 16? MS. MENNINGER: Objection. THE COURT: I'll sustain. Please rephrase. Q. Was Maxwell in the room just once while you were being sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein? A. No. Q. Was it just twice? A. No. Q. Approximately how many times? A. I don't know, but more than twice. MS. MOE: Your Honor, just one moment, please. THE COURT: Sure. Q. I want to ask you about that third category that I asked you about the incidents where it was you and Maxwell and Epstein and other people who were in the room. What was typically happening before incidents like that would start? A. It would typically be something very casual, like hanging out by the pool or sitting around in a living room or in the kitchen and just be, like, very seemingly casual hangouts. Q. When you would spend time at Epstein's house in Palm Beach, were there other women present in the house? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011984",
