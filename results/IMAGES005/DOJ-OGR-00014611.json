An aider and abettor must know that the crime is being committed and act in a way that is intended to bring about the success of a criminal venture. To determine whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abetted the commission of the crime with which she is charged, ask yourself these questions: One. Did the defendant participate in the crime charged as something she wished to bring about? Two. Did the defendant knowingly and willfully associate herself with the criminal venture? Three. Did the defendant seek by her actions to make the criminal venture succeed? If she did, then Ms. Maxwell is an aider and abettor and, therefore, guilty of the offense. If, on the other hand, your answer to any of these questions is no, then Ms. Maxwell is not an aider and abettor, and you must find her not guilty under that theory. Instruction No. 31. Counts One, Three, and Five. Conspiracy to violate federal laws. Conspiracy and substantive counts. Counts One, Three, and Five of the indictment each charge Ms. Maxwell with participating in a \"conspiracy.\" The statute for Counts One, Three, and Five is Title 18, United SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
