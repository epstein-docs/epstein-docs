PAGLIUCA: Thank you, your Honor. 4 BY MR. PAGLIUCA: 5 Q. Dr. Dubin, so after you stopped dating Mr. Epstein, and 6 let's focus on roughly 1994 through, let's say, 2004, did you 7 observe any inappropriate conduct between Mr. Epstein and any 8 teenage females? 9 A. I did not. 10 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'd like to show you some pictures that 11 have been admitted under seal. So we just need to show those 12 to the witness, the Court, and I will tell the government which 13 exhibits those are. I'm happy to show them to the government. 14 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. I have those. 15 THE COURT: Can you give the trial mark and yes, for 16 the Court and the witness. 17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor. So the first exhibit 18 is Government Exhibit 241, which I believe has been admitted 19 under seal previously. 20 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. 21 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. 22 MR. PAGLIUCA: So this will be for the Court and the 23 witness. And do we have that up, your Honor? 24 THE COURT: We do. 25 MR. PAGLIUCA: If I could ask Ms. Lundberg to expand SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014206",
