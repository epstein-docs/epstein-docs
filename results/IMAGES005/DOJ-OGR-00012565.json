PAGLIUCA: May I resume, your Honor? 3 THE COURT: Just a moment. 4 (Pause) 5 THE COURT: You may. 6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Thank you. 7 BY MR. PAGLIUCA: 8 Q. You were asked the question: 9 \"Q. Do you know what year Jane met Jeffrey Epstein and Glen Maxwell?\" 10 11 And your answer was: \"I would say we left it in 2002. 12 I would say '99 or 2000 maybe.\" 13 Q. Do you recall that question and answer? 14 A. I don't recall the question, but I imagine I made the 15 mistake between the two girls that I met, Jane and I made -- I 16 confuse the first girl with the second girl. The first girl 17 that I met, underage, was Jane. And I think it was 1994, sir. 18 The other girl that I met, it was 2002 or 2001, I'm not sure. 19 Q. Okay. Well, let's continue, Mr. Alessi, because the 20 questioner was Mr. Edwards. 21 Q. Do you recall Mr. Edwards being the person who 22 questioned you? 23 A. It was one of the lawyers. 24 THE COURT: Microphone. 25 Q. The person who was questioning you in this deposition was SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012565",
