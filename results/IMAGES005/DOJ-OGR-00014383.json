To the extent the main issue here is Virginia Roberts' testimony, that she was equally available to both sides. MR. EVERDELL: It's not Virginia Roberts that I'm thinking of, your Honor. I'm happy to say the name. It's Sarah Kellen. THE COURT: OK. I mean, suppose -- look, as I said, I've only slightly changed the meaning. It's the same meaning but it takes emphasis off of \"equal.\" I don't know what the defense is going to focus on in its closings, how much of the focus will be the absence of individuals. MR. EVERDELL: I expect we'll be talking about the absence of individuals, your Honor. THE COURT: All right. I'll hear from you in your letter. I'm keeping the charge.
