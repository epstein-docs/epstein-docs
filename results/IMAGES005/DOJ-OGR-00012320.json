And to be awarded fellow status means that I have been recognized as having made unique and significant, unusual contributions to the field of psychology. Q. Dr. Rocchio, how do you keep up to date on the subjects in which you specialize? A. Through a variety of ways. Through regular peer consultation, talking with other colleagues who are experts in the field, reading the literature. Certainly I learn a tremendous amount from the clients with whom I work, attending continuing education programming, and getting consultation from peers on an as-needed basis. Q. Do you receive any additional education and training to keep up to date? A. So as part of my licensure requirements and then also because it's a way to keep up to date, I regularly attend continuing education seminars, yes. MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, at this time the government moves to qualify Dr. Rocchio as an expert in psychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence. MR. PAGLIUCA: No objection, your Honor. THE COURT: Consistent with my pretrial ruling, I do deem Dr. Rocchio so qualified. MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012320",
