And can you describe that interview. A. Yeah. It was rather unique. She had been running around doing errands and wasn't able to make it up to the office where I had been interviewed with Jeff and Darren, and so she had asked if -- the receptionist asked me if it would be okay if I can come down and have the interview in the back of the sedan that was driven by a chauffeur. So our interview took place driving around Manhattan in the back of a limousine. Q. And how did that interview go? A. It went well. It was a different interview than I had experienced before, so I liked it, it was fun and I liked meeting Ghislaine. Q. Did you meet with anybody else or interview with anybody else after your interview with Ghislaine? A. Yes. After I passed that test, I was allowed to meet with Jeffrey Epstein, who would make the final decision on whether I would be hired or not. Q. And how did that interview go? A. And I interviewed back at the office with Jeffrey Epstein after waiting for a few hours for him. And when he came, we had a normal interview, if will you, and I left. And I found out the next day that I was given a job offer. Q. Now you mentioned that you were -- did you take the job? Okay. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013895",
