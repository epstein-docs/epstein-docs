You may\n7 take a copy of these instructions with you into the jury room.\n8 Instruction No. 2. Role of the jury.\n9 Your role is to pass upon and decide the fact issues that are in the case. You, the members of the jury, are the\n10 sole and exclusive judges of the facts. You pass upon the weight of the evidence or lack of evidence, you determine the\n11 credibility of the witnesses, you resolve such conflicts as there may be in the testimony, and you draw whatever reasonable\n12 inferences you decide to draw solely based on the evidence and from the facts as you've determined them.
