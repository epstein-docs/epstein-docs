She was trying to get these girls to touch Jeffrey Epstein. She was trying to normalize touch. She was doing it because she was a predator. For Annie, things didn't stop with foot massages. Maxwell pushed things further. Annie told you about how Maxwell insisted on giving Annie a massage, and during that massage, Maxwell folded down the sheet, exposing Annie's breasts, and began touching her breasts. Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of things you can say about a woman in her 30s groping the breasts of a 16-year-old girl, but a therapeutic massage is not one of them. That's not on a list of spa treatments anywhere. What Maxwell was doing was the same thing that she did to other girls - she was introducing touch, she was normalizing sexualized massages, she was breaking down barriers, she was moving the line forward, slowly, but surely. And what happened next is exactly what Maxwell was trying to set up. Towards the end of the trip, Epstein came into Annie's room and got into her bed saying that he wanted to cuddle. A man in his 40s was in her bed. He wrapped his arms around her and pressed his body against her. Just imagine how terrifying that would be for a 16-year-old girl. She's alone on a ranch in the middle of nowhere, and the adults in charge are the woman who groped her breasts and the man who's now in SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
