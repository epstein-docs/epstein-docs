If Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie really believed that making up a story about Maxwell would somehow benefit them, you better believe they would have told much better lies. If they wanted to frame Maxwell, if they thought doing so would somehow benefit her, they would put Maxwell in way deeper. They would have said that Maxwell was in the room every single time Jeffrey Epstein initiated sexual contact. Jane, Carolyn, and Annie would have said that Maxwell participated in all kinds of sex acts: Intercourse, oral sex, you name it. That's not what they did. Remember, Annie was so careful to make clear that the defendant touched the tops of her breasts, but not her nipples. Jane was careful to explain that Maxwell wasn't always in the room, and that the only physical contact she remembers is the defendant touching her breasts. Carolyn described oral sex and intercourse involving two other women, but with Maxwell it was just one time touching her breasts. Her memory is that Maxwell mostly talked with her, called to schedule appointments, invited her to travel. And how about Kate? She never put Maxwell in the room for a single sex act. She just remembered Maxwell walking her to the door and leading her into that sexualized massage. And remember, she said she was 17 when this happened. If she was going to lie about her age, why wouldn't she make herself younger? 16, 15, 14. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014580",
