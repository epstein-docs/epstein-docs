I know that the court reporters have often been very helpful in helping us do that as well.\n2 THE COURT: All right. Anything else?\n3 MR. ROHRBACH: On that point, your Honor, the parties are conferring on the redacted exhibits, and I anticipate we'll get a letter probably later today if not hopefully later today about exactly what the proposed redacted exhibits are, so that's finished in advance of the closing.\n4 MR. EVERDELL: We're working on that.\n5 THE COURT: OK. And have you worked out logistics on closings for the sealed material?\n6 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. I believe the plan is to do what we did with the video exhibits, which is to have the presentation from the parties up on the jurors' screens but not displayed on the public screens or in the overflow room. And we've also been working to get podium turned so that it's facing the jurors.\n7 And then I think there will be paper copies of the presentations of the parties, for counsel who have screens that are facing the gallery.\n8 THE COURT: Right. So there will be no -- orally, you're not going to refer to any real names of witnesses who testified by pseudonym, etc. That will at times be shown to the jury during the presentation, but that won't be publicly\n9 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
