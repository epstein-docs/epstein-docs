We'll start again tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.\n\nOf course, all rules continue to apply. Please continue to take all precautions regarding the highly contagious omicron variant. We need each of you here and healthy. So please, wear high quality masks and take all available precautions. As I've indicated before, we have masks for you. If anyone wishes to have transportation provided that hasn't taken us up on that offer, please let Ms. Williams know.\n\nRelately, the main courthouse administrator has asked me to remind you of the COVID protocols. You must remain masked in KN95 or N95 masks at all times, except when briefly eating or drinking. You must maintain distance in the jury room during deliberations as indicated in the seat placements and markings. If you do break briefly for lunch, please use the additional seating to gain even further distancing while your masks are briefly off.\n\nAs to the schedule going forward, we are going to continue with the same schedule as of today, if needed, 9:00 a.m. to at least 6:00 p.m. Please let me know by note if you agree to stay longer any day.\n\nHowever, I am going to ask that deliberations continue\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
