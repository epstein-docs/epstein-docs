I have no way of knowing that. 3 Q. I understand. Exactly right. It seems like an obvious question. I'm just simply saying that the video shows a certain date, October 20th, 2005. It wouldn't show what the house looked like 10, 15 years, 20 years beforehand; correct? 6 A. I'd only have to guess on that. That was the only time I was in the house up to that date in 2003 or 2005. The second time I was in it. Other than that, it's hard to compare because you're only in three rooms, one of which is a kitchen. 11 On the first working the case, that was in 2003 as opposed to 2005, which was totally new to me, except for the kitchen, the office, and the garden room. 14 Q. Correct. I think we understand each other perfect. 15 Now, we saw in the video and in the photographs that there were a number of framed photos around the house; is that right? 18 A. True. 19 Q. But the video and the photographs of those photos don't show how long any of those particular photos were in those locations in the house; right? 22 A. I don't know how we'd determine that. 23 Q. Well, I think you'd agree with me that the video shows that they were there on October 20th, 2005; right? 25 A. I will agree with that. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
