You also may not speculate as to the reasons why other persons are not on trial. Those matters are wholly outside your concern and have no bearing on your function as jurors in deciding the case before you. Instruction No. 55: Preparation of Witnesses. You've heard evidence during the trial that witnesses have discussed the facts of the case and the testimony with the government lawyers, the defense lawyers, their own lawyers before the witnesses appeared in court.

Such consultation helps conserve your time and the Court's time. It would be unusual for a lawyer to call a witness without such consultation. The weight you give to the witness's preparation for his or her testimony and what inferences you draw from such preparation are matters completely within your discretion.
