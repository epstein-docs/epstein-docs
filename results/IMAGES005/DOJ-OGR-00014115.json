I don't think we'll be able to rest until Monday morning.\n3 THE COURT: That's because there is some small issue you indicated or what?\n4 MS. MENNINGER: There is, your Honor.\n5 There also are a number of stipulations that are outstanding between the parties. There are some other documents that we are seeking to get custodians and stipulations to, and they're not ready today. So I understand your Honor wants to move this forward. The defense has had its case for a day so far. I don't think we are delaying --\n6 THE COURT: I'm not suggesting you are. I just always -- my approach is I want to use the time that we have. And needless to say, there is a pandemic. We don't want to unnecessarily delay and we want to move forward as quickly as we can using the time we have allocated. So if we have time today to get everything in, then we'll do it.\n7 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, on the issue of timing, I think we mentioned yesterday we may have one more witness who can only come on Monday. It is possible that we will call him. So we will need to have him on Monday, potentially.\n8 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we don't know who that witness is.\n9 THE COURT: Who is that witness and why can't they be SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014115",
