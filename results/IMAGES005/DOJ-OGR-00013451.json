A. Right. Q. And on the occasions when you did use the rest room on the Gulfstream, you never saw anything of a sexual nature going on in the passenger cabin, right? A. No, I did not. Q. Okay. Did you ever leave the cabin -- or, sorry, the cockpit to get coffee? A. No, we had our own coffee up in that area that we could make. Q. That was on the Gulfstream, I think, right? A. Correct. Q. But on the Boeing, there was a galley kitchen in the middle of the plane, right? A. There was. But also we had our own coffeemaker up front in the Boeing. But, yes, there was one in the galley. Q. Did you ever go get coffee from the galley kitchen in the middle of the plane? A. Not that I recall. Q. Okay. All right. Well, let me ask you this question: After a flight lands on either the Gulfstream or the Boeing, it's generally the pilot's responsibility to help straighten up the cabin after flight; is that right?
