Again and again throughout this trial, you heard about how these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey Epstein. While we're talking about physical touch, let me just pause here and point out that Annie, Carolyn, and Jane all testified that Maxwell touched their breasts. They all had very specific memories about that. Here's Carolyn's testimony about that: You remember that she told you about Maxwell coming into the massage room when Carolyn was naked. Maxwell touched Carolyn's breasts and told her that she had a good body. Jane told you about Maxwell touching her breasts too during sexual encounters with Maxwell and Epstein during so-called massages. Maxwell did it to Annie, too. Here's her testimony about that. Here's what she said about how that made her feel: I was very uncomfortable and fearful and wanted to get off the table, that massage table, and wanted it to be over with. Ladies and gentlemen, Maxwell touched these girls' bodies. Three different women told you about Maxwell touching their breasts when they were kids in massage rooms on massage tables and in the context of so-called massages. It's not an accident. It happened again and again and again. It is powerful evidence of Maxwell's guilt. And the woman they all described to you when they took SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
