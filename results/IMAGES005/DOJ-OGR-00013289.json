I'd also note that the phone number for Sky Roberts in these documents is the phone number for an entry in Government Exhibit 52 for -- that's listed as Virginia parents. So in the event that Government Exhibit 52 comes in, this is relevant to show that that entry, in fact, is the phone number for Virginia Roberts's parents. So those are the various three theories of relevance. In terms of admissibility under the business record exception, Ms. Gill, the witness, is a records custodian for Mar-a-Lago. So she will say that personal action notices are created in the ordinary course of business by managers at Mar-a-Lago at the time an employee is hired and that once an employee is eligible for benefits at Mar-a-Lago, those employees fill out the benefit application form in Government Exhibit 824 and submit them to Mar-a-Lago, which processes them, sends them out to insurance companies and retains them for Mar-a-Lago's own business purposes. THE COURT: And these were records that were maintained at Mar-a-Lago? MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor. I expect Ms. Gill to say that she has looked at these records in Mar-a-Lago's personnel file and confirms that they are true and accurate SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
