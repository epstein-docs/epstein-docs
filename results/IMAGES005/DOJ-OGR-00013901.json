Yes, Leslie Roth and Suann Pisap. Q. Who came before who, Suann or Leslie? A. Suann was before Leslie. Q. Was Leslie there when you left? A. Yes. Q. Were there any other people in the office that you recall working there in any of the offices there? A. On a daily basis, I can't remember if there was anybody else there working on a daily basis. We did have other personal assistants come through and hang out, not necessarily all day, but kind of like pit stops. That would be Emmy Taylor and Sarah Kellen. Q. So with respect to Emmy Taylor, I'm focusing your attention on the 1996, '97, '98. Do you recall seeing Emmy Taylor during that time period? A. I don't recall when I first saw her. I don't know. I would say it was the middle of my time there, in the middle of that time. Q. You also mentioned a Sarah Kellen. Do you remember when you started seeing Sarah Kellen? A. That was more towards the end. Q. So in the time period, '96, '97, '98, do you recall seeing Sarah Kellen? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013901",
