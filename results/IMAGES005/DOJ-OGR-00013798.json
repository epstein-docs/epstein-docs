Who did Annie tell you she went to see in New York?\n3 A. She went to visit her sister, Maria.\n4 Q. Who, if anyone, did Annie tell you she met in New York?\n5 A. She met Jeffrey Epstein on that trip.\n6 Q. What, if anything, did Annie tell you she did with Jeffrey Epstein in New York?\n7 A. She told me that she went out to a show with Maria and Jeffrey Epstein.\n8 Q. What, if anything, did Annie tell you happened during the show?\n9 A. I remember her telling me that Jeffrey was seated between the two sisters and that he reached out and touched her leg during the show.\n10 Q. Did Annie tell you at that time how she felt about that?\n11 A. Yes. She said she felt awkward and confused about it.\n12 Q. Did she tell you why she felt awkward and confused about it?\n13 A. Because Jeffrey Epstein had provided a lot of opportunities for her artistic career, and Annie felt that she couldn't really speak up or say anything, and she really didn't understand, I think, why it was happening in the moment.\n14 Q. When you say her artistic career, whose artistic career are you referring to?\n15 A. Her sister, Maria's.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00013798",
