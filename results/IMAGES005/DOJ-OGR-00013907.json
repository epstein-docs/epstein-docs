Why don't you start with the latter part of the question. 2 Q. Did you assist Ms. Maxwell in any way with the project. Island? 3 A. Yes. 4 Q. And what sort of things did you assist with? 5 A. There was new construction being done on the island, there were, I think, new swimming pools. But the majority of what I did was furnish the house, furnish the resort style. There was, you know, every house good that you could think of - silverware, glasses, towels, beach towels, linens. We had to ship all of that over, all of the furniture, all of the artwork. We even shipped in sand and palm trees and all kinds of things to get the island to what he wanted it to be. 6 Q. To be clear, you shipped in sand to a tropical island, why was that? 7 A. He wanted more sand on the beach. 8 Q. Palm trees, too? 9 A. Uh-huh. 10 Q. When you started when the island was acquired, was there anything, to your knowledge, on the island or was there nothing on the island? 11 A. I think there may have been one building or something. It was a lot of construction going on. We even had a fire department on the island, a firehouse with a proper firetruck 12 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00013907",
