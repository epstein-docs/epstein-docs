Your Honor, I think I would estimate about 45 minutes. THE COURT: Okay. And then, Ms. Moe, do you anticipate substantial redirect? MS. MOE: I do anticipate redirect, but I don't anticipate it being lengthy. THE COURT: Okay. We have a plan. I think we can get the jury. And we can bring the witness back up please. (Witness present) (Jury present) THE COURT: Thank you for your patience, members of the jury. I hope you had a nice lunch. And we will continue with the cross-examination of Witness Jane. Jane, I remind you you are under oath. Ms. Menninger, you may continue. MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor. JANE, resumed. BY MS. MENNINGER: Q. I want to go back to something I needed to skip earlier. I was asking you about whether or not you had traveled on Jeffrey Epstein's expense commercially after you moved to Los Angeles.
