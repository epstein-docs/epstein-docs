We've already had a lot of testimony about how there were frequent renovations to these places, we had testimony from Juan Allessi about that, and so there is no reason to believe that the interior of this townhouse looked the way it did in 2019, whether it looked the same way in 1994 to 2004, which is the time period of the conspiracy. In fact, quite the opposite. We have every reason to believe that there were significant changes based on the testimony. So my objection is, your Honor, I don't think, unless they have a witness who can say that these photographs taken in 2019 look like those rooms that I saw back in '94, '95, or 2002 or some time period that's actually in the conspiracy, and I don't think they do, then these are irrelevant and they shouldn't be admitted to the jury because there is no basis to believe that this is what the place looked like on the inside back 15 years before. I believe the only witness they have testified so far, and maybe the only one they can offer, is Jane, who testified very, very generally and very briefly about how the New York townhouse looked on the inside. She said something to the effect of, there was old wood, it was dark, there were creepy animal pictures on the wall. That's all we had. I think she said she may have slept on the eighth floor in the guest room, but there certainly wasn't a room-by-room description of what this place looked like. And my SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012543",
