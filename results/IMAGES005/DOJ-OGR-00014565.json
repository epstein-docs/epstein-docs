  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 165 of 257 2999 LCKCmax7 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey is before you is whether the evidence that you heard in this courtroom proves the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and it absolutely does. Second, I expect that Judge Nathan will instruct you that any witnesses who did not testify here were equally available or equally unavailable to both sides, the government and the defense. So when Ms. Menninger stands up here and says where is Virginia Roberts, where is Jane's mom, where are the employees, keep that in mind, it's just a distraction. Third, your common sense tells you that the sexual abuse of children is not the kind of crime that leaves paper evidence. The victims are the evidence. Their testimony, their consistent accounts of Maxwell and Epstein and how they operated, that's how you know they were in those massage rooms. People who prey on children do not leave behind documents admitting to what they did. The defendant was not walking out of those massage rooms writing a memo to herself saying, today I touched Jane's breasts. But you do have powerful corroboration from three different victims who each told you compellingly similar accounts of their experiences, three different victims who remember the defendant touching their breasts, three different victims describing how the defendant used massage as a technique to move into sexual abuse. And by the way, you do have documents to back up their testimony. Ms. Moe walked you through them. You've got the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014565",
