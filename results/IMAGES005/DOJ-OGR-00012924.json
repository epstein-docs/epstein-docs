Yes.\n5 Q. And if we go to page 2 of that document, these are the transactions you spoke about in your direct testimony on June 18th; right? There are two line items on that date; correct?\n6 A. Yes.\n7 Q. And the second line item was highlighted for you and it appears to show the purchase of a green helicopter from Sikorsky; right?\n8 A. It's what the transaction description reads.\n9 Q.
