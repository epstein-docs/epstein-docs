Next, the defense has tried to argue to you that Maxwell, that maybe she was just too busy to commit these crimes. So let's talk about that. The employees you heard from at this trial told you that Maxwell had all kinds of people who worked for her. She had personal assistants who she interviewed in the back of a limo, a woman to walk her dog. But despite all of this, the defense tried to argue that maybe Maxwell was so busy managing all of the details of Epstein's life, that maybe she wasn't involved in these crimes; that maybe she was so busy ordering sand to be delivered to Epstein's private island, that she just didn't know what was going on right in front of her. That's the argument. The argument that Maxwell did not know what was going on is flatly contradicted by the evidence in this case. Maxwell participated in the abuse; of course she knew what was happening. And in the moments where she wasn't in the room, she absolutely knew what was going on. The argument that Maxwell didn't know what was happening in the houses that she managed and lived in with the man she was sleeping with, what was going on with young girls she met in person and interacted with frequently, that argument is absolutely absurd and you should reject it completely.
