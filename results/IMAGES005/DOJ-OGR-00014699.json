EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think they've been fairly\n3 clear. They say: If the defendant aided in the transportation\n4 of Jane's return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico. The\n5 only evidence we have of a flight to New Mexico with Jane is\n6 the one in the flight logs, and it is a flight to New Mexico.\n7 And so the return flight would be some other flight besides the\n8 flight to New Mexico.\n9 She is also alleged that -- and to be honest, I think\n10 it was a little unclear what may have happened in New Mexico\n11 based on her testimony; but if there was any illegal sexual\n12 conduct, the flight to New Mexico, this is what they are\n13 debating, because they say, but not the flight to New Mexico,\n14 where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n15 Okay. So it seems that the jury is deliberating or at\n16 least trying to decide whether the flight to New Mexico was for\n17 the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. And they\n18 are confused that the return flight that happens after that,\n19 could that be the basis alone for a conviction on Count Four.\n20 Answer is no, because that return flight is not for the purpose\n21 of illegal sexual activity.\n22 MS. MOE: Your Honor, at the very least, the answer to\n23 this can't be no, because a jury could infer intent to engage\n24 in sexual conduct and the return of a flight in aiding and\n25 abetting that.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00014699",
