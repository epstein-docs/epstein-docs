Thank you.\n2 Members of the jury, that closes the evidence portion\n3 of the trial.\n4 Let me tell you what comes next.\n5 Closing arguments are summation by the parties. Both\n6 sides will have an opportunity to summarize for you their view\n7 of the evidence in the case and the arguments they wish you to\n8 consider. Following that, I'll instruct you as to the law that\n9 you'll follow during your deliberations and then you'll begin\n10 your deliberations.\n11 Monday, I'm going to ask that we start at 9:00 a.m.\n12 instead of 9:30. And I want you -- I believe we'll finish at\n13 our normal time, but there is a possibility that, just to get\n14 through what we need to do on Monday, we may go a little bit\n15 later. So I'm going to ask you to arrange to be here as late\n16 as 6:00 p.m. If that is a problem, on your way out tonight,\n17 let Ms. Williams know, and we won't do that. I want to stick\n18 to my promise to the schedule, but if everybody is able to stay\n19 as late as 6:00 on Monday, that might help us ensure that we\n20 can get done what we want to do in one day.\n21 So again, Monday, 9:00 a.m., the parties will do their\n22 closing arguments, their summations, then I'll instruct you as\n23 to the law, and then the deliberations will begin.\n24 So 9:00 a.m. on Monday. If staying until 6:00 on\n25 Monday is a hardship, please let Ms. Williams know on your way\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00014298",
