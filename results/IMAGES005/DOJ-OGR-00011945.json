During those first few months, as you were getting to know her, how did Maxwell come across to you? A. She seemed a little bit odd and quirky; but, you know, she would kind of like tease me at times and -- but she was nice. Q. How would you describe your relationship with Maxwell those first few months when you started spending time with her? A. In the first few months, I felt like I think she might have said, I'm sort of like an older sister. Because I at least thought that she was the same age difference maybe as my oldest sister, but I wasn't sure. Q. And at that time, approximately how old was your oldest sister? A. Twenty-seven. I'm not great at math. Sorry. Q. Did there ever come a time when Epstein ever gave you any gifts or money? A. Yes. Q. Approximately when did that first happen? A. It happened probably a few visits in. Q. What do you remember about the first time that that happened? A. I just remember that he said good-bye to me and was going to lead me to the front door. And he put cash in my hand. And I was a polite kid who didn't want to look. And I said, No, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011945",
