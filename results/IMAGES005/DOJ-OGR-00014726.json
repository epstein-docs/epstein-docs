Our deliberations are moving along and we are making progress. We are at a good point and would like to end today at 5:00 p.m. and continue tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.\nI don't know if anybody wants to say anything. I have a view.\nMR. PAGLIUCA: I think since they requested to leave, they should be allowed to leave, your Honor. Thank you.\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, the government defers to the Court for the schedule today.\nTHE COURT: I take it to mean they won't be done in an hour and so they're going to break for the night anyway. I will bring them out and send them home at 5:00 as they requested.\nI intend to do the following, though, I'll hear from you, but as I noted this morning, in light of where we now find ourselves, given the omicron variant, I must require deliberations every day going forward until they reach a verdict. I will instruct them that we will continue deliberations each day on the same schedule until they reach a verdict, so they should make themselves available for the remainder of the week and, if necessary, for the weekend. I'll tell them as I did yesterday regarding extending deliberations\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00014726",
