I think it's close.\n2\n3 But what I'm wondering is if what the defense essentially needs to make the arguments it wants to make is testimony from Mr. Glassman that he told the government that he told Jane that some form of cooperation or testimony would help her case. That question might have some evidentiary issues,\n4\n5 but it's not an attorney-client privilege issue.\n6\n7 I think the answer to that question basically gets the defense what it's looking for without infringing on attorney-client privilege. And so I'd like you to consider a proposal in which the testimony that you're seeking is limited to that and, depending on the parties' views and Mr. Glassman's views, if that is the limit of the testimony, whether it could be through stipulation.\n8\n9 So you'll consider that.\n10\n11 MS.
