THE COURT: I thought I did admit that under seal, but maybe I misremembered. MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we ended up admitting the one complete document. It is now marked J8 and 9 because it's the one that contains the seal. I think to narrowly tailor redactions so that it can't be matched up, it may include the case number, for example, certainly the plaintiffs' names, but otherwise I think there is a way to redact this so that the public has access to the bulk of the exhibit, but just not the personally identifying information. Again, I'm happy to speak with Ms. Moe about what she believes are the things that would lead to be a personally identifying piece of information, but portions of it, including the defendants' names and other pieces were testified about publicly on the record, not under seal. So, I think to keep the entire exhibit under seal does not comport with Lugash and the other precedent that requires us to sort of take a pen to the parts that are concerning. THE COURT: So let's do this, same process. If I didn't already, J8 and J9 are temporarily sealed and you'll confer on redactions. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. We'd be happy to confer. I do want to flag, because these documents are entirely public in full, it is very easy for a member of the public to compare SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012773",
