PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I'm going to object to this 3 as being outside what's been endorsed for this witness's 4 opinions in terms of the disclosure that was given to us. This 5 is now a narrative into basically treatment of people as 6 opposed to identifying what is or is not grooming. And that's 7 never been disclosed and we didn't do any Daubert on this. I 8 think it's outside of the opinion. 9 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, this is part of her basis 10 of her grooming opinion and delayed disclosure. This is 11 something that was extensively covered at the Daubert hearing 12 and in the briefing. 13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Her clinical treatment of people and 14 identifying what is or is not grooming was discussed. But now 15 she's getting into anecdotal discussions of treatment of her 16 own patients, I believe, which is inappropriate, A, and B, not 17 disclosed. And I don't think that this can be the subject of 18 expert opinion. This is simple anecdotal testimony about her 19 experience as a clinician. 20 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, she's explaining to the 21 jury the basis of her opinions. This is something that we've 22 litigated already. 23 THE COURT: It's a little different than what was 24 presented in the Daubert. Just in this moment, that is to say, 25 it's appropriate to describe generally the nature of her SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012334",
