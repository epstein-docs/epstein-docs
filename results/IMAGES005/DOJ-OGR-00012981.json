Yes, sir.\n4 Q. So getting back to the day of the first execution of the first warrant, that would be July 6th of 2019; is that correct?\n5\n6 A. Yes sir, it is.\n7 Q. And I believe the search started roughly around 5:30, 5:40 in the evening; is that right?\n8\n9 A. Yes, sir. I believe we approached the residence shortly after 5:30 and then actually entered the residence approximately 5:45, did the protective sweep, and I believe the search started at 6:15 p.m., approximately.\n10\n11 Q. In the evening?\n12\n13 A. Yes, sir.\n14\n15 Q. And I think you were there executing that and the second warrant you got on July 7th all the way through the night; isn't that right?\n16\n17 A. Yes, sir, that's correct.\n18\n19 Q. And I think the search ended early in the morning, around 6:30 a.m., is that right?\n20\n21 A. Yes, sir, it is.\n22 Q. But it's safe to say for those first two warrants, I'm not talking about the one when you came back with the CDs, but for the times -- the warrants you executed when you took the photographs were on July 6th, 2019, July 7th, 2019; right?\n23\n24\n25\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00012981",
