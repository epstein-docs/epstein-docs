  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 749 Filed 08/10/22 Page 21 of 236 925 LBUCmax1 through this witness, there is the massage table itself and the costumes. I think we agreed or the government represented that they do not intend to introduce the massage table itself, just photographs of the massage room where the table was present; is that right? MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. We'll be offering photographs of the massage room, we're not offering the physical massage table itself. THE COURT: But the photograph contains an image of the massage table? MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. There are a number of photographs of the massage room, those photos depict the massage table. We're not offering the table itself in evidence. MR. EVERDELL: I'll get to the photographs in a second, your Honor. The last physical item is the costumes themselves, I believe it's a box of five costumes, cosplay costumes that were found in the residence. Obviously, your Honor, this search took place in 2019, that's 15 years after the last year of the conspiracy charged in this case. We don't have any testimony up to this point about anybody involved in costume play, cosplay, dressing up. There may be some later, I don't know, your Honor, but the fact that these costumes are found 15 years later in the residence does not seem to be relevant or SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
