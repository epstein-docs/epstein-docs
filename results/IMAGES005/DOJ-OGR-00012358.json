PAGLIUCA: Yes. 3 THE COURT: And explore her expertise on those other reasons? 4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, she's being proffered as an expert in psychology, to begin with, and trauma. And the interplay between trauma, psychology, and delayed disclosure is simply not you're close to somebody and, therefore, you don't disclose or you feel embarrassed about something and you don't disclose. There are other things, and they relate to other facts in this case. And I think that we're entitled to bring those things out on this expert who is testifying as a blind expert. It's just fair game for cross-examination. 5 THE COURT: I think there's two questions. There's scope of direct and, I agree, to the extent that she's testified for a reason about delayed disclosure, you can cross her as to whether she's aware of other reasons for delayed disclosure. 6 I think the question is whether there is a version of that which is then seeking to solicit, sort of, not just I'm aware of other reasons. Are you aware of this kind of literature? Are you aware of that kind -- but to actually have SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00012358",
