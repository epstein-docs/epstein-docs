In other words, you cannot talk to anyone on the phone or in person, correspond with anyone or electronically communicate with anyone about this case. You can only discuss the case in the jury room with your fellow jurors during deliberations. Along the same lines, you may not try to access any information about the case or do research on any issue that arose during the trial from any outside source, including dictionaries, reference books, or anything on the internet. In our judicial system, it is important that you are not influenced by anything or anyone outside of this courtroom. Your sworn duty is to decide the case solely and wholly on the evidence that was presented to you in the courtroom. Instruction No. 4. Statements of counsel and Court not evidence; jury's recollection controls. You must determine the facts by relying upon your own recollection of the evidence. The case is not to be decided on the rhetoric of either the attorneys for the government or the attorneys for the defendant.

You should weigh and evaluate them carefully; but you must not confuse them with the evidence.
