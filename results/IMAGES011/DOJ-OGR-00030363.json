However, a sexual offender:\n\n(a)1. Who has been lawfully released from confinement, supervision, or sanction, whichever is later, for at least 25 years and has not been arrested for any felony or misdemeanor offense since release, provided that the sexual offender's requirement to register was not based upon an adult conviction:\n\na. For a violation of s. 787.01 or s. 787.02;\n\nb. For a violation of s. 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10);\n\nc. For a violation of s. 800.04(4)(b) where the court finds the offense involved a victim under 12 years of age or sexual activity by the use of force or coercion;\n\nd. For a violation of s. 800.04(5)(b);\n\ne. For a violation of s. 800.04(5)c.2. where the court finds the offense involved unclothed genitals or genital area;\n\nf.

For a violation of similar law of another jurisdiction,\n\nmay petition the criminal division of the circuit court of the circuit in which the sexual offender resides for the purpose of removing the requirement for registration as a sexual offender.\n\n2. The court may grant or deny relief if the offender demonstrates to the court that he or she has not been arrested for any crime since release; the requested relief complies with the provisions of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 and any other federal standards applicable to the removal of registration requirements for a sexual offender or required to be met as a condition for the receipt of federal funds by the state; and the court is otherwise satisfied that the offender is not a current and potential threat to public safety. The state attorney in the circuit in which the petition is filed must be given notice of the petition at least 3 weeks before the hearing on the matter. The state attorney may present evidence in opposition to the requested relief or may otherwise demonstrate the reasons why the petition should be denied. If the court denies the petition, the court may set a future date at which the sexual offender may again petition the court for relief, subject to the standards for relief provided in this subsection.\n\n3. The department shall remove an offender from classification as a sexual offender for purposes of registration if the offender provides to the department a certified copy of the court's written findings or order that indicates that the offender is no longer required to comply with the requirements for registration as a sexual offender.\n\n07/26/17 Page 10 of 114 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00030363",
