FLAGLER DRIVE, SUITE 300 PAVILION\nWEST PALM BEACH, FL 33401\n(561) 447-4011 * (561) 802-4121 (Fax)\nSENT VIA FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION\nApril 17, 2006\nLanna Belohlavek\nAssistant State Attorney\nOffice of the State Attorney\n401 N. Dixie Highway\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401\nRe: Jeffrey Epstein\nDear Lanna:\nI am in receipt of your letter, of today's date, confirming the offer of settlement in the Jeffrey Epstein matter. Please allow this response to serve as my acceptance with the following clarifications:\n1) You have agreed to allow Mr. Epstein to enter a Guilty Best Interest Plea. Additionally, you have agreed to review authority I provide concerning the effect a \"guilty\" plea has on a civil matter and in good faith consider allowing Mr. Epstein to plea \"No Contest.\"\n2) Regarding, the supervised contact, your letter refers to an \"approved\" adult. In our meeting today, you did not mention that the supervisor had to be approved. I agree that the supervision must be by an adult, other than Ms. Marcinkova and Ms. Kellen, with knowledge of the underlying facts. Additionally, I need to confirm that Mr. Epstein may be with his goddaughter without supervision.\n3) You agreed not to object to my selecting a duly licensed and experienced psychologist to conduct the evaluation.\n4) I accept the provision for payment of the cost of investigation for the Palm Beach Police Department as long as the cost is reasonable.\n5) Although your correspondence does not mention travel, I am confirming your agreement to allow Mr. Epstein to travel for business purposes. In line with our discussions, I request that you agree to allow Mr. Epstein to travel for philanthropy as well.\n07/26/17 Page 41 of 131 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00030508",
