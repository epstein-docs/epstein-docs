Sexual offenders have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public's interest in public safety and in the effective operation of government. Releasing information concerning sexual offenders to law enforcement agencies and to persons who request such information, and the release of such information to the public by a law enforcement agency or public agency, will further the governmental interests of public safety. The designation of a person as a sexual offender is not a sentence or a punishment but is simply the status of the offender which is the result of a conviction for having committed certain crimes.\n\n(13) Any person who has reason to believe that a sexual offender is not complying, or has not complied, with the requirements of this section and who, with the intent to assist the sexual offender in eluding a law enforcement agency that is seeking to find the sexual offender to question the sexual offender about, or to arrest the sexual offender for, his or her noncompliance with the requirements of this section:\n\n(a) Withholds information from, or does not notify, the law enforcement agency about the sexual offender's noncompliance with the requirements of this section, and, if known, the whereabouts of the sexual offender;\n\n(b) Harbors, or attempts to harbor, or assists another person in harboring or attempting to harbor, the sexual offender; or\n\n(c) Conceals or attempts to conceal, or assists another person in concealing or attempting to conceal, the sexual offender; or\n\n(d) Provides information to the law enforcement agency regarding the sexual offender that the person knows to be false information,\ncommits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.\n\n(14)(a) A sexual offender must report in person each year during the month of the sexual offender's birthday and during the sixth month following the sexual offender's birth month to the sheriff's office in the county in which he or she resides or is otherwise located to reregister.\n\n(b) However, a sexual offender who is required to register as a result of a conviction for:\n\n1.
