ATTN POLICE CLERKS: Please add the following names and their information into the system. Marie Alessi, W/F, DOB 10/27/46, 1515 South Flagler Dr., Apt. 1901, West Palm Beach, Florida 33407.

Invest.Cont. *************************NARRATIVE # 8 ************************* GREENE Reported By: MELNICHOK, THOMAS C. 11/12/03 Entered By.: GREENE, LINDA C. 11/12/03 On 10/08/03, Officer Weiss advised me that he had located Juan Alessi, the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the Towers Condominium. Officer Weiss further advised that Alessi's vehicle was a Ford Explorer, dark in color, bearing Florida tag U72UGL. On 10/13/03, I was advised by Sgt. Trylch that Epstein had met with Alessi and had reached an agreement to pay back the money taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time. I was also advised that Det. Dawson had interviewed Alessi and had obtained a full confession on the theft of the money but had denied taking the Glock hand gun. In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the books behind his desk. The surveillance video does not show Alessi taking the hand gun and Alessi denies taking the gun. On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with mailing the original back to me for my case file. At 1500 hours, Det. Recarey removed the video surveillance equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brillo. Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met with no response from his staff. It should be noted that Epstein had personally met with Capt. Elmer Gudger and at that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute Juan Alessi for the burglary and theft from his residence. ATTN POLICE CLERKS: Please show a full recovery of the U.S. Currency. Please do not show the Glock hand gun as stolen. 07/26/17 Page 64 of 95 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00031061",
