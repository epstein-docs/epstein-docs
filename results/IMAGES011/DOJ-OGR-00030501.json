I met with who stated she has two juvenile daughters. Tonight she noticed they went across the street to a vacant house with some boys. When she went to check on them she caught the boys drinking alcohol. She knew the boys were juveniles so she took the alcohol (tequila) from them she said a couple of the boys ran off. Juvenile one got in his silver Mitsubishi and went to the end of the street. He then stopped in front of her house. The juvenile stated he wanted his tequila back and he would come back at midnight. is concerned juvenile one might return and damage her guests vehicles. Mrs. asked her juveniles who the subject was and they were unfamiliar. I gave Mrs. a case card. I returned into service with no further incident. I informed morning watch of this address for an extra patrol for tonight only.
