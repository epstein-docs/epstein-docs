  "full_text": "7. Mr. Epstein will submit to any urinalysis, breathalyzer, blood tests, or any other testing requested by his pretrial intervention officer.\n8. Mr. Epstein, subject to the approval of the pretrial intervention agreement shall be permitted to report to his pretrial intervention officer by mail.\n9. As special conditions, Mr. Epstein agrees to be polygraphed by George Slattery & Associates at his own expense at intervals to be determined by the State Attorney's Office upon two weeks notice on any issue that the State Attorney's Office deems appropriate. These polygraph examinations will occur no more frequently than every two months. The results will be provided to the State Attorney's Office and will not be disclosed unless the State Attorney's Office determines that there has been a violation of the pretrial intervention agreement and the State Attorney's Office gives notice and consults with the defense before taking any action.\n10. As an additional special condition, at periodic intervals of six months, twelve months, and ten days prior to the termination of the pretrial intervention agreement, Mr. Epstein shall engage in sessions with Dr. Stephen Alexander at his own expense. Mr. Epstein specifically waives any privilege of confidentiality to the State Attorney's Office concerning the sessions. This waiver of confidentiality is limited to the State Attorney's Office. The results of the sessions with Dr. Alexander will not be disclosed unless the State Attorney's Office determines there has been a violation in the agreement and the State Attorney's Office gives notice and consults with the defense before taking any action.\n11. An additional special condition, Mr. Epstein will have no contact with specified individuals to be identified by the State Attorney's Office.\nFinally, Mr. Epstein will provide an admission that will be maintained in the State Attorney's Office file admitting that he knowingly, intentionally, and willfully solicited women for prostitution on three occasions as contained in the Indictment in Case No. 06-9454 CF A99. This admission will be provided to the State Attorney's Office to be used only in the unlikely event that there is a violation of the pretrial intervention agreement and the case is referred to the court system for prosecution.\nI believe this letter carefully and fully sets out the agreement reached at our meeting on Friday, July 21, 2006. If you should have any questions, please feel free to contact me.\nVery truly yours,\nJack A. Goldberger\nJAG/slm\n07/26/17\nPage 114 of 114\nPublic Records Request No.: 17-295",
