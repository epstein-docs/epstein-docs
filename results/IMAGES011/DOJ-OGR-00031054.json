  "full_text": "Date: 9/01/06 Time: 13:38:06 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Incident Report Page: 5 Program: CMS301L 1-03-001498 (Continued) told me that he had purchased a spy camera from a store on Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was in a clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it. Epstein then placed $4,000. in U.S. currency, one hundred dollar bill increments and left the bag on his desk as he always does when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up and twice to have $100. missing from the bag and the suspects image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there were thirteen one hundred dollar bills still in the white envelope and that nothing else in the house appeared to be disturbed by the suspect. Epstein took me to the computer room where he showed me a computer monitor that was displaying a still frame of the suspect. The computer indicated a time of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into the office area, walked behind the desk, opened the hand bag, and then opened the center drawer to the desk. It appeared as though the suspect was familiar with the house and the desk. Epstein told me that he did not know who the suspect in the photo was but thought it might be his former houseman because of his size and shape. Epstein also pointed out that the suspect in the video was wearing moccasin type shoes like his former houseman did due to his back injury. The suspect was a white male who was 5'10\" in height, 250 lbs., wearing tan pants, white shirt, and a hat. Epstein provided me with the former houseman's information which was Juan P. Alessi, DOB 02/12/50, living at 1515 South Flagler Dr., Apt. 1901, West Palm Beach, Florida. I advised Epstein that I would need to obtain a copy of the surveillance video from his computer hard drive in order to have in hands. Epstein told me that he had limited working knowledge of the system but he would contact the company who had installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday. Epstein told me he would call when he had more information. Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry into the house from the sliding glass doors on the south side of the house but not the west side of house because he had personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house. It is believed that the suspect also left the house by the same sliding door that was unlocked as there were no pry marks or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee Blvd. to obtain the information Crime Scene Manager Greg Parkinson processed the crime scene and collected the envelope that the money had been taken out of. 07/26/17 Page 57 of 95 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00031054",
