Juan said he worked for Mr. Epstein from January 1991 to until September 2002, as the house manager. Juan said he was very familiar with Epstein's schedule and the lay out of the house. I asked Juan if he took money and a gun from Epstein in the past weeks and Juan said he did not take the gun but did take money from Epstein's house. Juan explained approximately six weeks ago he became very depressed about his break up with his wife along with a cancerous medical condition he was fighting. Juan advised he became suicidal and decided to steal a gun from Mr. Epstein in order to kill himself. Juan said he knew Mr. Epstein had a gun in his office because he helped Mr. Epstein put it there. Juan described the gun as a silver revolver with a medium barrel that was holstered. Juan did not know the exact date, but he said it was approximately six weeks ago at about 0500 hours on a Sunday morning, he decided to enter Mr. Epstein's house at 358 El Brillo Avenue, in an attempt to steal the gun. Juan said he drove his white Caravan and parked it in the driveway of the house through an unlocked sliding glass door located near Epstein's office. Juan said he entered the office and attempted to locate the gun. Juan said he searched the office but could not find the gun. Juan said he then went into Epstein's briefcase and removed approximately $1900. in one hundred dollar bills from a white envelope. Juan said after taking the money he immediately left the house. Juan said on Sunday morning, 10/05/03, at approximately 0500 hours, he decided to return to 358 El Brillo in order to steal money once again from Epstein. Juan said he once again drove his white Caravan to the house and parked in the driveway. Juan entered the house through the sliding glass door and entered the office. Juan said he opened the briefcase and removed $5600. in one hundred dollar bills from a white envelope. Juan said he left through the same glass door and drove away. Juan said he believed he wore a creme colored loafers, light colored pants, a short sleeve shirt, and a baseball hat. Juan said he did not wear gloves on his hands. Juan said he needed the money to pay for his girlfriends immigration papers. I asked Juan if he was still suicidal. Juan said he was not and that he was seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis. (this was verified by Juan's son, John Alessi) Juan once again denied taking a gun from Epstein's house. Juan said he had a talk with Mr. Epstein on 10/12/03, and they agreed Juan would pay Epstein back for all the money that was taken.) 07/26/17 Page 63 of 95 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00031060",
