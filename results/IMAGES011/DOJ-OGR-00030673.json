Sworn taped statements were taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who in turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein's bedroom to provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims vaginas.
