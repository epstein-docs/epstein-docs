I'm livin Park, Fl, until January when I'm moving to Tallahassee to attend FSU. I was born in Ft. Lauderdale, Fl on the 30th, 1986. I eventually moved to Cooper City, north of Ft. Lauderdale. In ninth grade I moved with my grandparents. (I love them.) Anyway, (GO CLASS OF 2005!) I moved with my boyfriend to Orange Park in northern Fl, near Jacksonville. I'm excited to go to college that I can hardly wait! FSU is awesome! I'm really lucky because I got a scholarship. Otherwise, I'd have to bust my ass, and I'm not one of those people that like to work. Anyone who smokes understands that, LOL. I love all types of music that sounds awesome to me. My favorite band is Slipknot. (I'm pretty laid back. I go with the flow. I miss my friends back home but I know that I'll move on; If I don't, then how am I supposed to love my friends and I love my family. And Will my life. I love to party and smoke weed.
