Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was soooooooooo cool! There was 400 bikes. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I donated a football and a Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to. Bye! 4:18 PM - 0 Comments - 0 Kudos - Add Comment Tuesday, November 15, 2005 BUMMER MAN Current mood: crushed Category: School, College, Greek I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for FSU on Jan. 5. I'm packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal with it. 5:02 PM - 1 Comments - 2 Kudos - Add Comment http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.listAll&friendID=20425686&MyspaceID=12/21/2005 DOJ-OGR-00030854",
