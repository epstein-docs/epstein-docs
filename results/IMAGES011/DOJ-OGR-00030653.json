SG stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone number. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred dollars that day for bringing her.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson's cellular telephone 561-308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, \"the more you do, the more you get paid.\" Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an appointment for SG to go to Epstein's house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from SG's voice mail.\n\nBased on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein's residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG's name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein's house.\n\nOn October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson's residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm Beach Police Department.\n\nUpon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became acquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, she was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.\n\nThe foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed before me this 1st day of May, 2006 by Det Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.\n\nState of Florida\nCounty of Palm Beach\n\nSignature of Police Officer (F.S.S. 117.10)\n\nSignature Arresting Officer\nDate: 05/01/2006\n\n07/26/17 Page 3 of 22 Page 55 of 120 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00030653",
