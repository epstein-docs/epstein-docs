Epstein's assistant Sarah would telephone her every time Epstein was in the Town of Palm Beach and would place appointments for her to visit and work for Epstein. Each time something new was introduced, additional monies were produced and offered for AH to allow the acts to happen. AH consented to perform all these acts but was adamant that there was an understanding with Epstein that no vaginal penetration would occur with his penis. AH explained that Epstein's penis was deformed. AH explained that his penis was oval shaped. AH claimed when Epstein's penis was erect, it was thick toward the bottom but was thin and small toward the head portion. AH called Epstein's penis \"egg-shaped.\" AH stated Epstein would photograph Marcinkova and her naked and having sex and proudly displayed the photographs within the home. AH stated during one visit to Epstein's house in which she provided a massage to Epstein, his female friend, Nada Marcinkova, was also present. AH provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her would fondle each others breasts and kiss for Epstein to enjoy. Towards the end of this massage, Epstein grabbed AH and turned her over onto her stomach on the massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. AH became upset over this. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued to pump inside her. She screamed \"No!\" and Epstein stopped.
