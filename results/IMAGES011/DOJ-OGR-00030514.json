You and your client are invited to appear before the Grand Jury in the Palm Beach County Courthouse on March 7, 2006 at 9:00 AM, or as soon thereafter as they are able to hear you.\nThe invitation is extended to provide an opportunity for your client to present any personal testimony you may think proper. You should understand, however, that anything your client testifies to may be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.\nIn the event you and your client wish to present evidence or testimony of other witnesses you must submit a written list of names and addresses of potential witnesses by February 16, 2006 and make them available by February 21, 2006 for a sworn statement at the State Attorney's Office. Copies of potential physical evidence must be supplied by February 16, 2006. Keep in mind that only evidence that is relevant to the incident will be presented to the Grand Jury.\nThis invitation to your client is not an offer of immunity nor is it an effort to compel your client to participate in the Grand Jury proceedings in any way. Any participation on his part must be entirely voluntary, and a decision not to participate cannot be used to raise an unfavorable presumption against your client.\nThank you for your cooperation in this matter.\nSincerely,\nLanna Belohlavek\nAssistant State Attorney\nGrand Jury/Crimes Against Children\nlb/lb\nxc: Clerk's File\nSAO File\n07/26/17 Page 47 of 131 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00030514",
