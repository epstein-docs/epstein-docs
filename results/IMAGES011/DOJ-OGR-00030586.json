  "full_text": "Alberto,\n\nI received your short letter with great disappointment. Unfortunately, today, I cannot accept your \"resignation\". I'm sorry, but it is not that simple to abandon a \"family member\", no matter how frustrating or good-looking he may be.\n\nIf my appreciation for both you and your talent has not been adequately expressed as you and I have not spoken directly, I apologize.\n\nI am sure you have forgotten, but you had initially assured me that the island project would be done for last Christmas. I have always been both gracious and generous in forgiving things that have slipped by. You and I have, I think, a unique understanding.\n\nThe project would be completed by the end of July, when in fact, for example, the still wooden packing crates for side tables in the living room, has been sitting in the garage. Projects were supposed to arrive, but even until today, I have not been told when and where to expect the balance.\n\nAlberto, it is your right to take on only jobs you want. It is both unfair, unfriendly and unprofessional to simply leave a job undone in the middle. This is not your way. I don't believe that you would treat a like friend or client with the same disregard.\n\nI would hope that you will remember the big house island project. As you know, we have bought many things for the kitchen and have incurred great expense to get permits and allowances in a Morrocan style, but if you choose not to move forward, I think at a minimum, my house should not be left in the state of disrepair in which it currently sits and should be brought back to a livable condition. If Jean, who I have great respect for, does not want to complete it, then it is only an employee and as I have my total relationship not with Jean, but with Cabinet Pinto, the obligation falls on you personally. This is only right, you know it is.\n\nAs you are aware, I was told repeatedly that you would call me upon return from your vacation and finish the project. You and I have more of a friendship than my trying, in a\n\n12/26/17\nPage 119 of 131\nPinto's Request No: 17-295\nDOJ-OGR-00030586",
