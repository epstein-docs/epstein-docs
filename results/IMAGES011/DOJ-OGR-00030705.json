  "full_text": "Probable Cause Affidavit\nPalm Beach Police Department\nAgency ORI# FLO 500600\n\nbed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl always needed rides to and from the house.\n\nRodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High School after AH high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and direction to extend the rental contract.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated the encounters with AH, AD, Beale and during the time frame the girls stated they occurred.\n\nPursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein's private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein's plane at Palm Beach International airport. These records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen This comparison found that all the phone calls Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein was in Palm Beach.\n\nTherefore, as Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these incidents was fifty one years of age, did have vaginal intercourse either with his penis or digitally with AH, ML, CL and , who were minors at the time this occurred, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Jeffrey Epstein with four counts of Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor, in violation of Florida State Statute 794.05(1), a second degree felony. As Epstein, who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did use a vibrator on the external vaginal area of SG, a fourteen year old minor, there is sufficient probable cause to charge him with Lewd and Lascivious Molestation, in violation of Florida State Statute 800.04 (5), a second degree felony.\n\nThe foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed before me this 1st day of May, 2006 by Det Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.\n\nState of Florida\nCounty of Palm Beach\n\nSignature/Arresting Officer\nDate: 05/01/2006\n\nSignature of Police Officer (F.S.S. 117.10)\n\n07/26/17 Page 24 of 22 Page 107 of 120 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00030705",
