Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to \"work\" for Epstein. Robson stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson's house and leaves messages.\nSgt Frick entered the room and explained to Robson that based on her own statements, she had implicated herself by bringing underage girls to Epstein's house.
