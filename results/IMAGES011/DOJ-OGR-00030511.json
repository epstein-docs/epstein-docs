Dixie Highway\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401\n\nRe: Jeffrey Epstein\n\nDear Lanna:\n\nPlease allow this letter to serve as formal notice that I represent Mr. Jeffrey Epstein in regard to the investigation your office is conducting of Mr. Epstein. Additionally, Alan Dershowitz, Esq., who is a close friend of Mr. Epstein's, is serving as counsel to me in my representation of Mr. Epstein. Mr. Dershowitz is working closely with me on this matter and, in the event charges are filed, will likely petition to enter an appearance Pro Hac Vice along with other counsel.\n\nI appreciate the dialogue you have permitted throughout this investigation. I trust you will still invite me for a pre-filing interview in the event the State decides it has enough evidence to charge Mr. Epstein with a crime.\n\nI look forward to continuing to work with you on this matter.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nGuy P. Fronstin, Esq.\nGPF/mw\n\n07/26/17 Page 44 of 131 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00030511",
