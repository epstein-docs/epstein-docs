  "full_text": "Woman sues billionaire investor, says they had sex when she was 16 The Associated Press NEW YORK — A billionaire investor, already facing jail in Palm Beach County on charges of soliciting underage prostitutes, is being sued by a young woman who says he had sex with her when she was 16 and had sought his help becoming a model. The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in Manhattan's state Supreme Court, says financier Jeffrey Epstein had the teen perform a sex act when she brought photographs of herself for him to review in his Upper East Side mansion sometime in 2000. Epstein, 54, a money manager, told the teen he managed finances for Victoria's Secret and \"could get you into the catalog\" if she were \"nice\" to him, court papers say. The papers say being \"nice\" included massages and other favors. When the girl told Epstein, \"I am 16 years old and just want to model,\" he replied, \"Don't worry, I won't tell anybody,\" court papers say. Epstein, said by London's Mail on Sunday to be a close friend of England's Prince Andrew, has been indicted in Palm Beach on charges of soliciting underage prostitutes. That case is pending. \"The girl visited Epstein several times over the several months and engaged in bizarre and unnatural sex acts\" while she was a minor, the lawsuit says. Epstein \"repeatedly requested that [the girl] return with her 14-, 15-, and 16-year-old girlfriends, stating, 'Come by with your friends your age next time. Don't bring Sherrie (a mutual friend in her 40s). I love girls your age.'\" The young woman, now 23, kept returning to Epstein because she has \"mental issues,\" said her lawyer, William J. Unroch. She refused to elaborate, but court papers say she was \"disabled as a result of severe mental disease and defect.\" Epstein's lawyer in New York, Gerald Lefcourt, said, \"The girl has admitted she is insane, but she can read a newspaper and recognize the word 'rich.'\" Lefcourt also said the statute of limitations has expired for the woman's case criminally and civilly, and will almost certainly be dismissed. He refused to comment on Epstein's Florida charges. Meanwhile, Unroch, 57, also acknowledged that his client was living with him and was at the center of a $10 million lawsuit he filed last year against a neighbor who said he was having sex with underage girls. That case is pending. \"What she was doing at 22 is irrelevant to what happened to her when she was 16,\" Unroch said Wednesday. He went on to say he hoped Epstein would agree to \"do right\" by his client and resolve the case out of court.
