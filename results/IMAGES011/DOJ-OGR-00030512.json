FLAGLER DRIVE, SUITE 300 PAVILION\nWEST PALM BEACH, FL 33401\n(561) 447-4011 * (561) 802-4121 (Fax)\n\nSENT VIA HAND DELIVERY\n\nFebruary 17, 2006\n\nLanna Belohlavek\nAssistant State Attorney\nOffice of the State Attorney\n401 N. Dixie Highway\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401\n\nRe: Jeffrey Epstein\n\nDear Lanna:\n\nThank you for meeting yesterday and allowing Alan and me to address your investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. Pursuant to our discussion, I am enclosing an Incident Report from Victoria Secret outlining three (3) recent incidents of theft committed by [REDACTED].\n\nI am submitting this Incident Report with the express understanding that it will be kept in strict confidence. Specifically, since the Report only concerns [REDACTED], I believe there is no good faith reason, in any contact you may have with the store to mention Mr. Epstein's name or the investigation (especially in light of reports from multiple witnesses indicating Detective Recarey is providing damaging mis-information). Please let me know if you have any questions about the report and I will do whatever I can to immediately resolve your concerns.\n\nAdditionally, I am enclosing a credit card receipt (with non-relevant information redacted) confirming the purchase of the strap-on dildo that [REDACTED] purchased at Guys and Dolls. It will make clear that when the dildo was purchased [REDACTED] was over 18 years old and she charged the purchase on Nadia Marcinkova's credit card. Ms. Marcinkova had never before been to Guys and Dolls and was taken there by [REDACTED] who indicated it was her favorite sex shop.\n\n07/26/17 Page 45 of 131 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00030512",
