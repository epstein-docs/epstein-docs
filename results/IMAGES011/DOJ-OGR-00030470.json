  "full_text": "smoking, and having sex; (3) being observed by the police as clearly on drugs; and, (5) running away to an unsafe drug location. With this background, it has certainly taken a while to sort things out, but, the agreed to facts of this case are that: (1) this girl, was driven to my clients' home with the express and sole purpose of providing a topless massage; (2) she told my client she was 18 years old; (3) she received her agreed upon two hundred dollars; (4) before leaving she wrote down her phone number and stated next time she wanted to bring her twin sister along; (5) my client never saw her again; and, most importantly (6) no sex occurred. It was only several MONTHS later, that we are led to believe, one of her parents, both of whom have criminal records for fraud, contacted the police.\n\nFinally, as you consider your options, I quite frankly think it unfair to give much weight to the pressure being brought to bear by law enforcement. Their comments which have been brought to my attention certainly indicate, at a minimum, a lack of objectivity. With all this in mind, I believe that it is only just, especially now that we are both certain there was no sex involved, that your office opt NOT to prosecute this case. However, given the totality of the circumstances, coupled with the fact that a \"Google search\" is now a \"forever\" reference on any job application, I believe that the girls involved, my client, and all concerned would be better served with at worst an informal resolution of this matter. Certainly it seems preferable to filing a charge that we all currently concede would likely not succeed if brought to trial. I appreciate the personal attention you have given to this matter, and look forward to you response.\n\nVery truly yours,\nJACK A. GOLDBERGER\n\ncc: Lanna Belohlavek, Esquire",
