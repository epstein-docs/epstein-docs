  "full_text": "33. Under Defendants' plan, scheme and enterprise, Defendant Epstein paid Defendant Robson to repeatedly find and bring him underage girls, who were delivered to Epstein by Defendants Robson and Kellen, in order for Epstein to solicit, induce, coerce, entice, compel or force such girls to engage in acts of prostitution and/or lewdness. 34. Plaintiff Jane Doe was the victim of Defendants' plan, scheme and enterprise. Defendant Robson took Jane Doe to Epstein's home under the pretense that Jane Doe would be paid to give Epstein a massage. Defendant Kellen delivered Jane Doe to a room with a massage table and told that Epstein would be in shortly. Jane Doe was alone in the room when Epstein arrived. Epstein told her to remove her clothes and left the room. When Epstein returned he was wearing only a towel. He removed his towel, and laid down on his stomach on the massage table. Epstein again told Jane Doe remove her clothes. In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane Doe complied, removing her clothes except for her panties and bra. Shortly after starting to rub Epstein's back, Epstein told Jane Doe to sit on his back. Jane Doe, out of fear and trepidation, complied. After a period of time Epstein got up from the table and went behind the door. For several minutes Jane Doe heard loud noises and moans and believes that Epstein was masturbating. Thereafter Epstein, naked, returned to the massage table and laid face up on the table. Epstein then told Jane Doe to continue with the massage and told her to sit on top of him. Out of fear and trepidation, she complied. As Jane Doe rubbed Epstein's chest, Epstein began to use a vibrator on Jane Doe's vagina. Thereafter, Epstein began to digitally stimulate and attempt to penetrate Jane Doe's vagina. At this same time, with his other hand, Epstein was masturbating. Upon reaching orgasm, Epstein got up from the massage table and told Jane Doe to write down her name and phone number and then left the room.
