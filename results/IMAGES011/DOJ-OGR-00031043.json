Recarey and I went to 358 E1 Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal assistant Sarah Kellen in regards to obtaining the video footage of the suspect burglar.\nDet. Recarey obtained a video of the footage starting at 0426 hrs, and ending at 0430 hours. The before mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein residence moving a duffle bag and opening a desk drawer. A copy of this video footage was captured onto a compact disk and was placed into evidence via a property receipt.\nAt 1400 hours, Det. Dawson and I went to the Towers Condominium, 1515 South Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed several video cameras on the outside of the building and a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the building.\nAt 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager Greg Parkinson that he had located fingerprints for the suspect Alessi from a Town of Palm Beach identification card application.\nAt 1630 hours, I called the Towers Condominium and spoke with the manager of the condominium who verbally identified himself to me as Donald Dement. Dement gave me his direct business number 561-833-8170, and his home phone number 561-624-2892. Dement told me that he was familiar with the name Alessi but he advised he wouldn't recognize him. Dement told me that they had several video cameras and that they did record the surveillance camera but the recording system had broken on Sunday night and he didn't have anything on the tapes.\nDement told me that the condo does have a midnight doorman who stands duty at the desk in the lobby and anyone coming in the building regardless of what door they come in, would have to pass the doorman. Dement told me that the desk man for Sunday morning, 2300 to 0700 hours was Greg and he next worked on Wednesday, 10/08/03. Dement was not familiar with what Alessi drives or which parking spot was his but he advised that he would check and call me back in the morning.\n07/26/17 Page 46 of 95 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00031043",
