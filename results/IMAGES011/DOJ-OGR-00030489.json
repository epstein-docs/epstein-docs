Conclusion Under the circumstances of this case a plea to felony aggravated assault is both unwarranted and presents a grave risk the client will be brandished a sex offender, bearing the attendant burdens inherent with that classification. In light of this, and the credibility issues presented by the complaining witnesses, combined with the client's two psycho-sexual evaluations and lie detector tests, we believe that at the very most, a misdemeanor plea to solicitation is appropriate. Very truly yours, Gerald B. Lefcourt 07/26/17 Page 22 of 131 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00030489",
