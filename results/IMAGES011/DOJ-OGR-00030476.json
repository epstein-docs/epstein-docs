It was reached, however, with the clear and joint understanding that the client would not be subjected to sex offender registration requirements in any state or foreign jurisdiction. Moreover, the limited time provided did not allow for an opportunity to conduct an even cursory investigation or research into the ramifications. Were any charge to be brought, having now learned of the serious danger a plea to felony aggravated assault presents with regard to sex offender registration, coupled with the facts presented at our meeting and outlined below, we strongly believe that a plea to misdemeanor solicitation is the more appropriate resolution. As we discussed, this could include an agreed upon allocution, as we are mindful of your concern about labeling the girls \"prostitutes.\" In this regard, as we discussed, the law and relevant statute are clear that the complaining witness need not be a \"prostitute\" in order to satisfy the elements of the offense.\n\nPage 9 of 131",
