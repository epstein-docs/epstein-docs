Dixie Highway West Palm Beach, FL 33401 Re: Jeff Epstein Third Party Attorney Fee Payment Dear Ms. Belohlavek: As you know I represent Mr. Jeff Epstein. Mr. Epstein's house manager, Yanush Banasiak, was asked to speak with your office regarding the matter that I represent Mr. Epstein on. In anticipation of Mr. Banasiak's meeting with your office he decided to retain legal counsel. Yesterday, he met with and retained, attorney Michael Salnick, who will be attending Mr. Banasiak's statement in your office today at 1:30 p.m. Since your questioning of Mr. Banasiak concerns information that he may have that arises out of his employment with Mr. Epstein, Mr. Epstein will be paying Mr. Banasiak's attorneys fees. I felt it important to notify you of this third party attorney fee payment structure and confirm that you have no objection. Mr. Epstein would like to wire the payment for Mr. Salnick's representation to Mr. Salnick as soon as possible. Therefore, I would appreciate your getting back to me today on this issue.
