Pagan and I went to 1515 So. Flagler Drive, Apt. #1901, West Palm Beach, Florida, in an attempt to locate suspect Juan Alessi. As we were getting into the elevator on the ground floor, we came in contact with Alessi's wife, Marie Alessi. I explained to Marie why we were there and she agreed to speak to us. Marie said she and her husband, Juan Alessi, have been separated for approximately two months and they are going through divorce proceedings. Marie said Juan no longer lives with her at this address and she has a court order which states Juan is to have no contact with her. Marie said on this date, at approximately 1100 hours, Juan drove by her as she was walking out of the Ross Department Store located on the southeast corner of Okeechobee Blvd. and Military Trail. Marie said Juan waved at her and that was the extent of their contact. Marie said she does not know where Juan is living. She said he is driving a white caravan. Marie supplied me with Juan's cell phone number, 309-5439. Marie advised Juan has been depressed lately, due to their separation. I advised Marie to be aware of her surroundings and be on the lookout for Juan and if she comes in contact with him to call the police immediately. Marie also supplied me with her son's phone number, John Alessi, 309-2645. I called Juan Alessi on his cell phone. Juan agreed to come to the Palm Beach Police Station for an interview. Juan arrived at the police department and I placed him in the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I read Juan his Miranda Rights from a prepared rights card in which he stated he understood and signed. I asked Juan what his connection was with Mr. Epstein, 07/26/17 Page 48 of 95 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00031045",
