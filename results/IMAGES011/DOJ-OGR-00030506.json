DERSHOWITZ\n1575 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE\nCAMBRIDGE • MASSACHUSETTS • 02138\n\nApril 19, 2006\n\nMs. Lanna Belohlavek\nAssistant State Attorney\n401 North Dixie Highway\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401\n\nDear Lanna:\n\nGuy has asked me to provide you with the research on why it makes a difference whether Mr. Epstein pleads \"nolo contendere\" or \"guilty\". As you can see from the enclosed statute, a plea of \"nolo contendere\" is not admissible as an \"admission against interest\" in a subsequent civil case. A plea of guilty - even a so-called \"best interest\" plea of guilty -- is admissible. That is the only real legal difference. If you need anything further, please do not hesitate to call me or Guy.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlan Dershowitz\n\nEnclosure: FL ST § 90.410\n\n07/26/17 Page 39 of 131 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00030506",
