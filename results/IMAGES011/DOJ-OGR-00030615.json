Epstein knew she was a soccer player and would be attending Lynn University. I asked ______ if Epstein knew her real age. ______ stated Epstein did and didn't care. The most recent massage she provided was on October 1, 2005. During the massage, she asked Epstein if she could borrow one of his vehicles to visit her family and boyfriend in Orlando, Florida. Epstein had told her she could borrow one of his vehicles but later stated he would rent her a car. She continued with the massage as Epstein grabbed her buttocks and caressed the buttocks cheeks. I asked ______ if she was wearing undergarments to which she replied her thong underwear. Once he tried to touch her breasts, she would pull away from him and he would stop. ______ was asked if he ever used a vibrator on her. ______ was aware of the vibrator but advised she never would allow him to use the vibrator on her.
