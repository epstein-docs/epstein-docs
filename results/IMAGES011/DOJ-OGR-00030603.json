Krischer, State Attorney Office of the State Attorney Fifteenth Judicial Circuit 401 North Dixie Highway West Palm Beach, FL 33401 Dear Mr. Krischer, Please find enclosed the probable cause affidavits and case filing packages thus far resulting from the Palm Beach Police Department's investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. The submission of these documents are both in response to Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek's request for them and to serve as the Palm Beach Police Department's presentation for prosecution. I know that you agree that it is our shared responsibility to seek justice and to serve the public interest by discharging our duties with fairness and accountability. I must renew my prior observation to you that I continue to find your office's treatment of these cases highly unusual. It is regrettable that I am forced to communicate in this manner but my most recent telephone calls to you and those of the lead detective to your assigned attorneys have been unanswered and messages remain unreturned. After giving this much thought and consideration, I must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office's handling of this matter has taken and consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases. Sincerely, Michael S. Reiter Chief of Police MSR:nt 345 South County Road • Palm Beach, Florida 33480-4443 • (561) 838-5460 • Fax (561) 835-4700 • www.palmbeachpolice.com Page 5 of 120 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00030603 07/26/17",
