  "full_text": "Probable Cause Affidavit\nPalm Beach Police Department\nAgency ORI# FLO 500600\n\nMolly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked Robson up and she was taken to Epstein's house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as Jeff Epstein's bedroom. Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah, then left the room and informed Robson Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel and laid nude on the massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated \"He tried to touch me and I stopped him.\" I asked how he tried to touch her. Robson stated that Epstein grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson told Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.\n\nAfter the massage Epstein stated to Robson that he understood she was not comfortable, but he would pay her if she brought over some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson stated that in total she only remembers six girls that she brought to see Epstein, each time she was paid $200. Robson stated she had brought the following girls: SG, , , J.S. (a16 year old female), YL (a 16 year old female) and . Robson said that at the time she brought these girls to Epstein's house they were all14 through 16 years of age. I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised SG was the youngest as she was fourteen when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when they arrived. They were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked her if SG was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew that SG wanted to make money. She approached SG and explained about going to work for Jeff, SG agreed and arrangements were made to bring her to Epstein's house on a weekend.
