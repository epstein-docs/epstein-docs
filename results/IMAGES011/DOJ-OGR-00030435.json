  "full_text": "Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per \"massage\" session - and who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan.\n\n13. Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at Epstein's mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator.\n\n14. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's mansion in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a towel.
