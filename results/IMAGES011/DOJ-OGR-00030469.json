WEISS\n*BOARD CERTIFIED CRIMINAL TRIAL ATTORNEY\n†MEMBER OF NEW JERSEY & FLORIDA BARS\nJune 22, 2006\nBarry Krischer\nFlorida State Attorney's Office\n401 North Dixie Highway\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401\nRe: Jeffrey Epstein\nDear Mr. Krischer:\nI write to you to confirm our meeting with Lanna on June 14, 2006. It is our hope that in light of the recent developments in this case which we have set forth in our letter of June 5, 2006, our meetings, and herein, in particular the fact that there is no sex alleged, this case can be disposed of with, at most, an informal agreement, or more appropriately, no charges being filed at all.\nAs you know, it was only at the June 1, 2006 meeting, after eight months of investigation, that you and I both learned, for the very first time, and I believe to our collective disbelief, that the allegation of the girl did not raise the slightest hint of actual sex. Up until that point, we had all been laboring under the assumption this girl had alleged multiple sexual encounters with my client. In fact, as you are aware, it was with this in mind that we hired George Slattery, a highly respected polygraph expert, who unequivocally confirmed our client's long held position both that there was no sex and that the girl clearly stated she was 18 years old. Since, we now know with certainty that there are in fact no allegations of sex, and no sex occurred between my client and this girl, I would ask you to consider your previous statements to the effect that you would not bring a \"touching case\" - NO sex, NO charge - in fashioning an appropriate resolution to this matter.\nAs we have discussed many times, the girl's credibility is highly questionable and has been severely undermined by her actions over the past few months in: (1) repeatedly changing her age on her web page (first 17, then 16, then 15) and posting graphic nude and suggestive photographs of herself; (2) boasting about shoplifting, underage drinking,\n250 Australian Avenue South, One Clearlake Centre, Suite 1400, West Palm Beach, FL 33401\nTelephone: 561.659.8300 Facsimile: 561.835.8691\n07/26/17 Page 2 of 3 Public Records Request No.: 17-295\nDOJ-OGR-00030469",
