Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.\n(b)(5)\nHugh\nSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone\nPage 6829\nDOJ-OGR-00025614",
