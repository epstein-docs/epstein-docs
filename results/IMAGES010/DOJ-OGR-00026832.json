Examination of the fixed brain (minus the left occipital pole, removed at the time of autopsy for possible toxicology) shows normal leptomeninges. No contusions, stigmata of herniation, or other surface abnormalities are seen. External brainstem landmarks and cranial nerves are normal. Vessels at the base are distributed normally, and have no atherosclerosis. The cerebellum is normal.\nCoronal sections of the cerebral hemispheres reveal normal cortical ribbon, white matter, and deep gray nuclei. There is no midline shift. Hippocampi are symmetrical and of normal volume. Ventricles are normal in size and appearance.\nAxial sections of the brainstem and cerebellum en bloc show the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus to be well-pigmented. The aqueduct and fourth ventricle are normal. Cerebellar cortex, white matter, and dentate are normal.\nCranial dura from the convexities, tentorium, and base shows falcine ossification (comment: common age-related finding). The venous sinuses and tributary (bridging) veins are patent.\nSpinal cord and dura from upper cervical to cauda equina levels show no abnormality, externally or on midsagittal section.\nPHOTOGRAPHS: YES\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: NO\nFINAL NEUROPATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:\nI. NORMAL BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD\n[redacted] MD\nThe information provided above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\nElectronically signed by [redacted] on Aug 20, 2019 05:41:27 PM\nDOJ-OGR-00026832",
