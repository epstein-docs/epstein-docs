  "full_text": "Page 1344 Good morning all. I apologize I was not in attendance mainline today, but Central Office called me just before mainline commenced to request some documents and information regarding inmate Epstein. I was speaking on the phone with [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] whom you both met during the suicide reconstruction. [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] informed me not to do an update to the institutional supplement for suicide watch as it is not required by policy or suggested. He stated Psychology should only be doing an institutional supplement for Psychological Observation as there is no specific policy for it. I had recently updated the Psychological Observation Procedural Memorandum which I will attach here. I have not updated the SW supplement for several years as it was noted that policy did not require or suggest one any longer. Also [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] is requesting a copy of the post orders (general orders) for suicide watch. He also asked for the sign-in sheets for the suicide post orders for staff who were sitting on Epstein during his suicide watch. Do we have a copy of this in the Lieutenant's office as well as the post orders? If there are not specific post orders, I think we should get a copy of the quarterly post orders to demonstrate that the officers who sat on inmate Epstein signed for the quarter. Thanks!
