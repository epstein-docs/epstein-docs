Subjective/Objective Presentation Inmate Epstein was in good spirits today and engaged in reciprocal conversation with this writer this morning. He smiled and remarked, \"welcome back\" when this writer arrived. b(7)(A) b(7)(A) b(7)(A) When this writer attempted to get a more detailed account from him, indicating that it would be rare to have such impairments in memory as he does not suffer from an acute cognitive disorder, he smiled and said he understood my position. Inmate Epstein did reveal he is unhappy with his current confinement in Special Housing (SHU) as he considers it \"a punishment cell.\" He said he finds the restrictions up there unfair as he has not done anything wrong. Inmate Epstein stated he feels it is dangerous in the SHU, he cannot sleep well up there due to noise from the other inmates, it smells, and it is difficult for him to work on his legal case up there. He stated he has not received the phone calls he was promised nor has he been able to recreate recreation. It was explained to him that he spends the entire day in the attorney conference room and it is likely that he has missed times when staff members have attempted to give him phone calls and recreation. Inmate Epstein also reported complaints about the attorney conference room, stating they do not take him to the bathroom frequently enough. Inmate Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality at this time, stating \"I am too vested in my case to fight it, I have a life and I want to go back to living my life.\" He denied any acute symptoms at this time. According to his log book, he has been eating, drinking, sleeping, and interacting with the inmate companions. He has also been attending his daily legal visits. Intervention(s) Inmate EPSTEIN was provided with brief supportive interventions and psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. Inmate EPSTEIN was mostly receptive to these interventions. He requested to be housed in general population rather than the SHU and stated he wanted to remain on psychological observation due to his concerns with being in the SHU. Progress/Plan In an abundance of caution, inmate Epstein will remain on psychological observation. b(7)(A) b(7)(A) Inmate Epstein will be seen daily by psychology while on psychological observation.
