I'm reaching out on a story regarding Jeffrey Epstein's death. We have found a series of posts that were made on the website 4chan prior to any public announcement of Epstein's death. The first post was made at 8:15 AM and the subsequent posts described in detail the first responders' actions. The first news report about Epstein's death was at roughly 9 AM. I've pasted one of the posts below: Anonymous ID:rPtND1Si Sat 10 Aug 2019 08:47:56 No.222520442 Quoted By: >>222520675 >>222520785 >>222521102 >>222521684 >>222522176 >>222524005 >>222524197 >>222524420 >>222524649 >>222527632 >>222519952 worked asystole arrest for 40 minutes, als intubated in the field/epi/2 liters NS infused.
