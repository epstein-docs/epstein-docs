His thoughts were organized and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial, or irrelevant content. There was no evidence of perceptual disturbance, delusional ideation, or a formal thought disorder. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. He noted having normal sleeping and eating habits. Mr. EPSTEIN explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation, planning, and intent. He was future-oriented and expressed a commitment to life and safety, agreeing to contact staff immediately should he experience suicidal ideation or psychological distress. He also denied thoughts of harming others. Risk Factors Assessed: This writer screened the inmate for a variety of empirically validated factors commonly associated with risk for self harm. The following STATIC risk factors were assessed to be present and increase the inmate's risk for engaging in suicide related behaviors: High Profile Crime, Lack of family connections, Sex offender status The following DYNAMIC risk factors were assessed to be present and increase the inmate's risk for engaging in suicide related behaviors: Current physical pain, Fear for own safety The following PROTECTIVE factors were assessed to be present and may decrease the inmate's risk of suicide:Able to identify reasons to live, Adequate problem solving skills, Denial of suicidal ideation/intention/plans, Future orientation, View of death as negative, Willingness to engage in treatment Risk Factors: (b)(7)(A) (b)(7)(A) Protective Factors: Mr. EPSTEIN adamantly denied current suicidal ideation or intent or a history of suicide attempts.

He furthered, \"I would not do that to myself.\" He denied feelings of hopelessness, although did report being \"depressed\" and \"unhappy\" about his current legal situation. He previously denied a history of childhood abuse. He reported he is sleeping adequately now that he is no longer in the SHU. He appear future-oriented as he endorsed an interest in being housed in general population. Weighing of Risk and Protective Factors: Mr. EPSTEIN adamantly denied suicidality.
