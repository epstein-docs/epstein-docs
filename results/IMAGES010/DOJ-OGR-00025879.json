The one edit I suggest based on PDS is to delete the text I colored red and replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from court and was assessed the next morning.\n>>> Hugh Hurwitz 8/12/2019 1:17 PM >>>\nPlease review for accuracy before I send to (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\n(b)(6);\n(b)(7)(C) here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:\n7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no plans had been established).\n7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.\n7/8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.\n7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.\nPage 10328\nDOJ-OGR-00025879",
