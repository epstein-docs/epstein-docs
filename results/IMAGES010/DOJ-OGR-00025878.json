Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no plans had been established).\n7/7/19: Warden identified him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.\n7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted.
