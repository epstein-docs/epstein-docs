It's based in large part on the timeline you sent.\nIs there any reason why this information shouldn't be released to the public?\n(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\n\nOn July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.\n\nOn July 29th Epstein was removed from suicide watch by Psychology Services Department at MCC-New York after daily interaction with him and according to established procedures. Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a requirement that he have a cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9th. In addition, the SHU confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks.\n\nOn August 9th at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein's cellmate was taken out of the institution for a Court appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not return to the institution. On August 9th, Epstein was in a legal visit with his lawyers all day until 6:45 p.m. Epstein returned to cell with no cellmate even though Epstein was on a PSYCH Alert which included a requirement that he have a cellmate. No cellmate was assigned to his cell on August 9th.\n\nOn August 10th at about 12:00 a.m., while in his cell, Epstein acknowledged a Correction Officer performing a routine check. After midnight, it appears that not all of the checks required to be performed were actually done.\n\nOn August 10th at approximately 6:33 a.m., Staff serving breakfast meal found Epstein unresponsive in his cell. Staff called for assistance and began CPR. When EMS arrived at the institution, he was transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:36am.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00025499",
