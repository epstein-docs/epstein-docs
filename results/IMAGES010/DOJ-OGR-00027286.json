Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At times, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or on a general population housing unit. On two occasions, July 26, 2019, and July 27, 2019, he described b(7)(A) himself as a coward and as someone who does not like pain. On July 28, 2019, he told b(6); b(7)(C) the toilet in his cell would not stop flushing for an extended period of time, and he then took to sitting in the corner with his hands over his ears. Mr. Epstein indicated he was agitated following this incident and was unable to sleep that night.\n\nANTECEDENT CIRCUMSTANCES\nMr. Epstein entered BOP custody on July 6, 2019, with a history of convictions for sexual offenses and allegations comprised of more serious charges. The current indictment alleged sexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July 18, 2019, Mr. Epstein's request for bail and pretrial release was denied.\nb(7)(A)\nOn August 9, 2019, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,000 pages of documents into the public domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book order receipt for titles such as SM 101: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The documents were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who alleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was Mr. Epstein's ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities. According to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days although it is unknown whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist and it is not known with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July 16, 2019, and the other on August 9, 2019. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A social call would be recorded; given the limited information known about Mr. Epstein, knowledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with him.\nb(7)(A)\n5\nDOJ-OGR-00027286",
