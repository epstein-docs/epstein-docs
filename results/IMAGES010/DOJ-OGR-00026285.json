Subjective/Objective Presentation The \"Eating/Shower Chart\" noted that yesterday he ate breakfast. He is not in the Psych Observation cell for about 12 hours per day because of being in Attorney Conference with his Attorneys, so the \"Eating/Shower Chart\" may not reflect all of his meals. He stated he was served one meal in Attorney Conference yesterday. He stated he drinks a lot water at night. The Psych Observation log noted he talked about life in general population and he slept. Earlier he had complained that his right arm was numb and hanging. Nurse (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) from Medical had seen him for this. When this writer was interviewing him, he said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. This writer notified Nurse (b)(6); (b)(7)(C). He stated last night when he flushed the toilet it kept flushing for 45 minutes. He stated he found it so aversive and upsetting that he said he sat in the corner and held his ears. He said because of this he was agitated for hours and was not able to sleep. The Lt. will be moving him to a different cell and he was informed of this. He stated the feeling he got with the noise of the toilet was similar to when he was in SHU. He said he may have something on the Autism spectrum. He said in the movie \"Rain Man,\" the person with Autism had an aversion to noise. He stated he is also really good with numbers. Current Mental Status: He exhibited a mildly anxious mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff and Inmate Companions if he starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff and Inmate Companions if he has these thoughts. Intervention(s) Supportive and educative interventions were again provided. He had not been given the Turning Point handouts yesterday that were on his cell door, so they were handed to him by staff today. Progress/Plan He will remain on Psych Observation in an abundance of caution and pending housing arrangements to be made on Monday. While on Psych Observation, he will be seen daily by Psychology.
