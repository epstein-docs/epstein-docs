Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.\n\nShirley Skipper-Scott\nAssociate Warden\nMCC New York\n150 Park Row\nNew York, New York 10007\nOffice: 646-836-6452\nBlack Berry: 646-423-0777\nsskipper-scott@bop.gov\n\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2019 9:42 AM >>>\nThanks.
