Upon my arrival, I observed staff carrying inmate Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 on a medical stretcher. At that time, as the Internal Security Officer, I escorted staff and inmate Epstein to medical on 2 Sally. As per Operations Lieutenant, I was instructed to escort EMT from the rear gate to medical on 2 Sally. When EMT was ready for departure, I escort them back to the Rear Gate. As per Operations, I was assigned as Escort Officer to conduct this emergency trip to the outside local hospital. At approximately 7:15am, we arrived at New York Presbyterian - Lower Manhattan Hospital located at 170 William Street, New York, NY 10038. When we entered the emergency room medical personnel intervened. We maintained direct supervision of the inmate as we waited for further guidance from medical personnel at the hospital. We were notified that the inmate would be transported to the morgue so we escorted the staff to the morgue. While in the morgue, we still maintained direct supervision of the inmate until approximately 12:57pm. At this time, the inmate was no longer under our direct supervision as medical staff took over. Operations Lieutenant was notified and we were instructed to report back to the institution - we arrived at 1:03pm.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00026910",
