I discussed it with (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) today.\n\nBasically following inmate Epstein's suicide, Wardens are defaulting to leaving inmates on suicide watch longer than the institutional Psychologists would advise. So the memo to the RDs seeks to remind Wardens to utilize the professional psychological expertise of the institutional psychologists in managing inmate suicide through the variety of healing strategies. (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) is in the office tomorrow, 10/18, if you want to discuss with her the best way to communicate this to the RD and Wardens and if you have any questions.\nHave a great day.
