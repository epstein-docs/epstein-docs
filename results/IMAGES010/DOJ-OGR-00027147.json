Well I guess more misleading is appropriate way of saying it (Lying through obfuscation). No one was \"on camera\" that could have went to Epstein's cell. Barr \"has watched the videos.\" What he left out is that if you know the camera's timing and locations you could easily get to Epstein's cell easily. In fact 2-3 men (F.o.R.b.illionairesl.nterests agents) could pass through the camera holes on their way to kill Epstein. So in order to debunk this \"conspiracy theory\" please release the camera type and capabilities of each camera, service records, repairs and upgrades. Can probably find this by going through your public budget/spending info, but thought this might be a quicker way. Now I understand you wouldn't want to give out location of cameras and I fully understand the need for that. Cameras pan, tilt, zoom in and could very easily create \"holes\" for people to go undetected. Yep there'd have to be some of you corrupt to pull this off and well that just adds to the credibility of my claims. Most of you are corrupt. Why was every \"news\" outlet reporting for WEEKS that two cameras were out and there was no correction to the story from anyone? Then Ag Barr claims to have watched all videos and says no one enter that area. Except you could get there without being on camera. So, technically he didn't lie, but he is trying to cover it up with completely misleading statements. Oh, and there was one camera out, the one pointed at his cell. Did he watch only a few hours, or a day or two prior? Criminals will wait and do crazy things in order to achieve their goals. I can only imagine the lengths the sick wealthy pedos in power and corrupt underlings would do to keep themselves safe. Just look at the ongoing coup by traitors. They'd do much worse than any criminal I am sure. Wait 1-?? days hidden to kill someone ABSOLUTELY!",
