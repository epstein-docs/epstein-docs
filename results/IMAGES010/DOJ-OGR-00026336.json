This is highly misleading. As you know (and AG Sessions and DAG Rosenstein were also acutely aware of), over the 5 years leading into this administration our prison population had dropped 40,000 inmates, but our staffing had gone up (and pop has continued to drop another almost 9,000 since the start of the Administration))!

I continue to point out to anyone that will listen (and have reiterated this in several Hill briefings), the problem is not our authorized staffing levels or funding, rather it is finding good candidates to come work for us in hard to fill areas. I have dozens of examples where we post jobs, get 30 applicants and only 10 end up actually coming on board. At that rate it will take a long time just to fill the vacancies we have. We are working on several new initiatives to try and make BOP more attractive to applicants (unfortunately news like this does not help).\n> Anyway, I know you know this, but also want you to know that we are working to change this narrative, but right now we are getting drowned out by the media hysteria.
