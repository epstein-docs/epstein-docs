  "full_text": "Page 2362\nnotified if suicidal ideation is apparent from the responses. Further, any BOP staff member may place an inmate on suicide watch.\nThe Suicide Prevention Program at each BOP facility is administered by a Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator. The Program Coordinator, who must be a doctoral-level psychologist, ensures compliance with suicide intervention and prevention policies, which include training, identification, referral, assessment, and intervention. In BOP facilities, suicide watch is typically a short-term and highly restrictive intervention measure. Every institution has one or more rooms designated specifically for housing an inmate on suicide watch. These areas are set aside as special cells, typically in the BOP's Health Services division, which allow staff to maintain a safe environment for the inmate without compromising the ability to observe and protect the inmate. This environment includes easy access to the room, privacy, unobstructed vision of the inmate at all times, and limited availability of objects, materials, or architectural features that would allow for easy self-injury. Inmates on suicide watch are evaluated daily by a psychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions. Once an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist following a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate.\nWith regard to staffing levels, 15,012 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and 1,654 correctional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2019. The BOP continues to work on hiring and retaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General. The BOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review. The BOP will assess any additional measures which should be taken after those processes are completed.\nThe factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors include an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a plan), motivation, and subjective feelings of defeat or humiliation.\n\n[b](6); [b](7)(C)\nPublic Information Office\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n(202) 353-[b](6); [b](7)(C)\n>> [b](6); [b](7)(C) 10/22/2019 11:39 AM >>>\n[b](6); [b](7)(C)\nThe USA Today's top reporter (who's written front page stories on the BOP) is asking if BOP is \"designating specific officers to regularly monitor surveillance video in segregated housing units and other locations where inmates are at some risk for suicide.\"\n\n[b](5) [b](6); [b](7)(C) [b](6); [b](7)(C) [b](6); [b](7)(C) [b](6); [b](7)(C)\nThanks,\n[b](6); [b](7)(C)\n[b](6); [b](7)(C)\nPublic Information Office\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n(202) 353-[b](6); [b](7)(C)\nPage 13892\nDOJ-OGR-00026051",
