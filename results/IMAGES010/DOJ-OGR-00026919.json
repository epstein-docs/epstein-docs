Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Prisons Metropolitan Correctional Center 150 Park Row, New York, NY August 10, 2019 MEMORANDUM FOR FILE METROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER FROM: [b)(6); (b)(7)(C) Unit Manager SUBJECT: Inmate Epstein, Jeffery Reg. No. 76318-054 This memorandum is in regards of inmate Epstein, Jeffery Reg. No. 76318-054. On August 9, 2019, I spoke with inmate Epstein concerning him making a call to his family. I told inmate Epstein I was leaving the facility around 7:00 p.m. Inmate Epstein agreed to shorten his attorney visitation to make his social call. I escorted inmate Epstein to Special Housing Unit around 7:00 p.m. I placed inmate Epstein in the shower on (G) Tier and escorted the phone for him to make a social call. I placed the phone in the first jack to the left on G tier. Inmate Epstein explain to me that he didn't have his phone set up to use his Pac and Pin number. I asked inmate Epstein who he was calling, he stated his mother. I remember dialing a number starting with 347, but the number was note notated. Inmate Epstein began talking on the phone. I told the staff to end inmate Epstein's call after 15 minutes. They complied. DOJ-OGR-00026919",
