He stated it is here and he will be able to start using it tonight. He discussed how he does not think he will be able to sleep in SHU and how he does not like SHU because of the noise. He discussed issues on not getting some medication with Medical today.\n\nThe \"Eating/Shower Chart\" indicated yesterday he ate breakfast and dinner, drank liquids, and took a shower when offered and so far today it noted he ate breakfast and drank liquids. The Psych Observation Log noted he slept, drank water, went to legal, and talked to an Inmate Companion about investments.\n\nCurrent Mental Status: He exhibited a neutral mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no indication of disturbed thought process or content. Intellectual ability appeared to be above average. Personal hygiene was adequate. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff if he starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff if he has these thoughts.\n\nIntervention(s)\nSupportive and educative interventions were provided. When asked about the Turning Point handouts for coping in SHU, he stated he already knows these strategies before he read the handouts and had tried them when he was in SHU the last time. He stated with the noise in SHU, he said the strategies will not work. He was encouraged to try them.\n\nProgress/Plan\nThe Chief Psychologist was consulted. Psych Observation will be discontinued. Mr. Epstein was educated about both routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology staff. He will be seen in follow up by Psychology tomorrow to monitor his mental status and to provide further intervention if needed and he was informed that he will be seen by Psychology tomorrow. In the meantime, he was encouraged to self-refer to Psychology if needed to which he agreed and seems capable of doing. If he remains in SHU, he will be seen by Psychology in SHU Rounds and in SHU Reviews. The SHU Lt. was informed that Mr. Epstein needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\n\nCompleted by [b(6); b(7)(C)] PsyD on 07/30/2019 13:54\n\nGenerated 07/30/2019 13:54 by [b(6); b(7)(C)] PsyD Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page 1 of 1",
