Skipper-Scott Date 2019/07/24 02:41 Subject: Inmate Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. 76318-054 Attachments: TEXT.htm Good Morning: I would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmate's meals be delivered from the housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference? Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom every hour without being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate? Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other inmates who are in attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch which is sent up from food service every morning. Please provide a response. Thank You, \"I don't cheat to win, I'd rather lose.\" - Serena Williams (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) MCC New York 150 Park Row New York, New York 10007 (646) 836 (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) Page 12135 DOJ-OGR-00025997",
