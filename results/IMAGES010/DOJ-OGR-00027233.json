Skipper-Scott 2019/07/29 10:02 Subject: Epstein Update Attachments: TEXT.htm Good morning: Same presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his neck) may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is aware he will be returning to SHU, but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in his arm. He requested to have one good night of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate tomorrow. (b)(7)(A) I told him he can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good night’s sleep, but that he would be returned to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues precluding him from returning to SHU tomorrow and that we could not house him in the SW/Hospital area because (b)(7)(A) or more comfortable for him. (b)(7)(A) He will remain on psychological observation today and will transition to the SHU tomorrow. Thank you (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) Psy.D.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) saw him. He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell. Thanks, (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)",
