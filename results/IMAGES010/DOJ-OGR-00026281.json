On 7/23/19, inmate Epstein was charged with code 228 (Tattooing or Self-Mutilation). These infractions were assigned incident report number 3282555.\n\nBackground Information\nAccording to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by [b(6); b(7)(C)] \"Inmate Epstein denied any history of mental health treatment, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Inmate Epstein denied any treatment in the past or present with psychotropic medication. He also denied any mental health symptoms at this time.\"\nAccording to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by [b(6); b(7)(C)] \"Inmate Epstein denied any past or present suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He denied ever engaging in any suicide attempts or self-injurious behavior in the past.\"\n[b(7)(A)]\n\nClinical Interview and Mental Status Exam\n[b(7)(A)]\nCurrent Mental Status: He exhibited a neutral mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no indication of disturbed thought process or content. Intellectual ability appeared to be above average. Personal hygiene was adequate. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff if he starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff if he has these thoughts.\n\nClinical Impression\nAccording to his last Diagnostic and Care Level Formulation Note dated 7/09/19 by [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] \"No Diagnosis, No Dx - Current.\"\n\nFindings\nThe determination of whether an inmate is competent to proceed with the disciplinary process is based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's (1) ability to understand the nature of the proceedings, and (2) their ability to assist in their own defense. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, one of three findings can be made: (1) the inmate is COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process; (2) the inmate is NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT but could be restored to competence with treatment; or (3) the inmate is NOT COMPETENT and is unlikely to become competent.\n\nRecommendations Regarding Sanctions\nIn the case of inmate Epstein, after a review of available psychological and psychiatric records as well as information pertaining to the offense conduct, it is determined that this inmate is:\n(X) COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process.\n( ) NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT, but could become competent with treatment; it is recommended that the inmate for an updated competency assessment in 30 days.\n( ) NOT COMPETENT and not likely to become competent.\n\nGenerated 07/30/2019 12:33 by [b(6); b(7)(C)] PsyD\nBureau of Prisons - NYM\nPage 1 of 2\nDOJ-OGR-00026281",
