However, to the extent the defendant puts these materials at issue at trial either through the defense case or cross-examination, the Government reserves its right to use these materials, for example, to cross-examine the defendant, or to offer prior consistent statements of witnesses, should it be appropriate to do so. In addition, the Government further reserves its right to use these materials at trial for any purpose that would be permissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, even assuming these materials were suppressed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Attorney\nBy: /s\nAlison Moe / Maurene Comey\nLara Pomerantz / Andrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Attorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)",
