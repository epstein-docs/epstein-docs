Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nAugust 18, 2021\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to footnote 1 of the Court's Opinion and Order denying the defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's supplemental pretrial motions.\n(Dkt. No. 317). In that footnote, the Court noted that the defendant's motion for a bill of particulars included a request that the Government identify her unnamed co-conspirators, as did her position in the parties' joint letter regarding the disclosure schedule.\nThe Court wrote that, because the Government had not objected, it \"presumes the Government intends to disclose this information to Maxwell at the same time that . . . it discloses Jencks Act material.\" (Id. at 12 n.1).\nTo be clear, the Government objects to any requirement that it provide an exhaustive list of co-conspirators, whether in a bill of particulars or otherwise, and does not intend to do so absent further order of the Court.1\n1 The Government has opposed the defendant's requests for such a list as part of its opposition to the defense motions for a bill of particulars.\nIn the parties' joint letter regarding the disclosure schedule, the defendant sought early disclosure of both the identities of unindicted co-conspirators and their statements.\n(Dkt. No. 291 at 7-8, 10-13). The Government took the position that the defense could \"receive notice of any co-conspirator statements through Jencks Act materials and marked exhibits.\" (Id. at 5).\nThe Government also noted that \"[t]he cases cited by the defense all DOJ-OGR-00004994",
