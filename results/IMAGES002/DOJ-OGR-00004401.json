At this time, things don't look promising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft, they changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from solicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to forcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense).

Please try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay.\" Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafaña that he believed the defense would want to go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafaña sent the revised plea agreement to Lefkowitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the defense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to him on September 17, 2007, would control.\n\n120 The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this \"hybrid\" plea agreement had substantially diverged.\n\n121 The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the name of the U.S. Attorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give \"the trial team\" an opportunity to voice any objections because \"if it's something they don't feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn't go forward with it.\"\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-00004401",
