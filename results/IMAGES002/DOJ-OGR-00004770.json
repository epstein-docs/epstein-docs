I also neglected to mention that I would ask the Court to strongly suggest to the Bureau of Prisons that Ms. Days be allowed to continue with any of her drug treatment. She's taking drug treatment programs, as well as any vocational or educational programs that she is allowed to participate in. I think it will only help. She is going to try to get into any program she can as much as she can, but -- THE COURT: It is my recommendation that she be incarcerated at Danbury, but as close as possible to the New York City Metropolitan area in order to have facilitate family visitation, which as a result of the pandemic, she has been denied for over a year. It's my recommendation that Ms. Days be considered for the RDAP program. It's my recommendation that Ms. Days be given continuing drug treatment, and as Ms. Days has proven that she is someone who benefits from coursework and from being put in a position to assist other inmates, it is my hope that the Bureau of Prisons will take note of that and make sure that she has plenty to do, both education-wise and mentoring-wise. MR. DONALDSON: Thank you. THE COURT: Ms. Days, when you are released, you will have 72 hours to report to a United States probation officer here at the courthouse on the sixth floor, and for four years you'll meet on a regular basis with your probation officer.
