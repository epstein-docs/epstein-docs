CHIUCHIOLO: No, your Honor.\n3 THE COURT: Ms. Days, you're required to pay $100 in court costs. That will be taken out of your prison wages at the rate of $25 per calendar quarter, or 50 percent of your gross monthly earnings if you're in a Unicor grade one through four program.\n4 I should interrupt myself to say that Ms. Days has done two very admirable things. First of all, she's accomplished a pretty impressive record, under pandemic circumstances, of coursework; and, second, she has completed this Court's Focus Forward program, run by our pretrial division, and I'm a big fan of that program. It was started on my watch, and I'm a big supporter of that program.\n5 I'm glad, Ms. Days, that they let you into the program, and I'm proud of you for having completed the program. I believe that it is one of the best tools that you will have going forward.\n6 Mr. Donaldson, did you have any recommendation for place of incarceration?\n7 MR. DONALDSON: Yes, your Honor. We are asking for as near to New York City as possible, and I would say that one very near, but that has problems sometimes; so I say the nearest one to New York City as possible. I'm sure, hopefully, at some point, Tiff will start getting some family visits so\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00004769",
