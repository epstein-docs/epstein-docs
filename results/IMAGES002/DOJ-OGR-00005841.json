(Order at 1, Dkt. No. 297). This order did not expressly require the Government to specifically identify co-conspirator statements within its other productions.\n\nIn the defendant's second round of pretrial motions, she asked the Court to order the Government to disclose a series of information about the Indictment. That list contained a renewed request for the Government to identify uncharged co-conspirators, but it did not contain a new request for the Government to separately identify co-conspirator statements within its discovery production. (Mem. of Law at 23-24, Dkt. No. 293). On August 13, 2021, the Court denied the defense's motion, but in a footnote, explained that it \"presume[d] the Government intends to disclose\" the \"identi[ties of] the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment,\" since the Government had not previously opposed that request. (Op. & Order, Dkt. No. 317 at 12 n.1). The order said nothing about identifying co-conspirator's statements. (Id.).\n\nThe Government filed a letter opposing the request for the Government to \"identify [the defendant]'s unnamed co-conspirators.\" (Letter at 1, Dkt. No. 320). The defendant filed a new letter in response, raising \"two issues.\" (Letter at 1, Dkt. No. 331). First, the defendant sought the identities of co-conspirators. (Id. at 1-2). Second, the defendant took a third bite at the apple, once again seeking \"disclosure of the purported co-conspirator statements [the Government] intends to offer at trial.\" (Id. at 3). The defendant also argued that the Court's scheduling order had already required the Government to specifically identify co-conspirator statements. (Id. at 3-4).\n\n57\n\nDOJ-OGR-00005841",
