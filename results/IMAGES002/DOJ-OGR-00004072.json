COMEY: Your Honor, I would just note, given the volume, we would certainly make a first production seven weeks out from trial. But as is typical in preparing for trials, especially trials that involve so much material, there may be rolling productions after those seven weeks. And as is typical with trials in this district, it is possible there may be supplemental motions in limine after the date that the parties have proposed for motions in limine in this case.\n4 \n5 We would absolutely make our best efforts to meet the seven-week deadline as opposed to the six-week deadline, but I did want to be candid with the Court about our estimations of how quickly we'll be able to complete those disclosures thoroughly and carefully.\n6 \n7 THE COURT: Okay. I mean, I'm likely to adopt the seven weeks, given that, and urge the government to do what it needs to do to be ready for that. And to the extent that there is some additional supplementation that has to be done after that date, we can consider that. But the government's proposing six weeks. I think we're coming to agreement on seven weeks. So, there is a lot to do for everyone, and we'll get it done.\n8 \n9 MS.
