Villafaña further cautioned that, although she was planning to file charges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, \"then we all need to meet with the victims, the agents, and the police officers to decide how the case will be resolved and to provide them with an explanation for the delay.\" Because the Department's Criminal Division did not conclude its review of Epstein's appeal by May 6, however, Villafaña did not file charges that day.\n\nVIII.

The contemporaneous communications confirm that in 2008, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department's policy regarding the issue.\n\nUnrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April 18, 2008, Acosta and Sloman received a citizen complaint from an attorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the Florida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The attorney asserted that the CVRA guaranteed him \"an absolute right to meet\" with USAO officials because he believed that he was the victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division Chief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2005 Guidelines, \"our obligations under [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.\" On April 24, 2008, the Appellate Division Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had \"confirmed with DOJ that [her] reading of [the 2005 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not triggered until a case is filed.\"343\n\nOn May 7, 2008, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim's\n\n342 The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the initiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department's statutory obligations to the victim.\n\n228\nDOJ-OGR-00003430",
