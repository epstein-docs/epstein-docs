He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an assessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.81 Sloman added that he did not know how a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either state or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall how the two-year term was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the defense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by Acosta following \"extended consideration, research, and discussion,\" among Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and Villafaña.82\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or who reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR, however, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges, Epstein would have felt he had \"nothing to lose\" and \"undoubtedly\" would have chosen to take the case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial, and in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to testify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years \"as a fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,\" and \"if we . . . felt we could have gotten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.\"\n\nAcosta told OPR that \"I had decided and endorsed\" the two-year resolution \"at some point,\" and that it resulted from \"back and forth\" discussion \"over the course of some days or a week or two.\" As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO's role in this case merely as a \"backstop\" to the state's prosecution, which he explained to OPR was \"a polite way of saying[, ']encouraging the state to do a little bit more.[']\"83 Acosta said that he understood two years' imprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges that PBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.84\n\nthe attorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in its determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar with the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable to his or her case. In discharging these duties, the attorney for the government should . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information upon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n\n81 In Sloman's view, Menchel and Lourie were \"two of the finest trial lawyers\" in the USAO.\n\n82 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were \"two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta's] front office who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.\"\n\n83 In commenting on OPR's draft report, Acosta's attorney asserted that OPR's use of Acosta's quote, \"a little bit more,\" \"unfairly minimized\" Acosta's and the USAO's efforts to achieve justice in this case.
