(Barry Williams/for New York Daily News) A legal battle is also brewing over a 2016 meeting — first revealed by the Daily News — between Manhattan federal prosecutors and attorneys for Epstein accusers.

Isabel Maxwell, Ghislaine Maxwell's sister, right, leaves Manhattan Federal Court Friday, April 23, in New York. (Barry Williams/for New York Daily News) Maxwell now cites that meeting as evidence that prosecutors and victims' lawyers were improperly in cahoots. Manhattan federal prosecutors say they opened an investigation of Epstein and Maxwell in response to investigative reporting by the Miami Herald in late 2018. Sources familiar with the meetings said victims' lawyers were frustrated by prosecutors' failure to take action following the outreach — rebutting Maxwell's claims of collusion. https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-ghislaine-maxwell-arraignment-20210423-b3aza5eh7bddna7r247px2yb7e-story.html 7/10 DOJ-OGR-00004971",
