The government knows that it \"is under no obligation to turn over that which it does not have,\" United States v. Upton, 856 F.

Mendez v. Artuz, 303 F.3d 411, 414 (2d Cir. 2002). For the reasons articulated in Ms. Maxwell's ex parte submission, the EVCP Materials directly contradict the \"motive theory\" that will be advanced by the prosecution at trial - that Ms. Maxwell was the procurer of underaged women for Epstein.\nIn addition, even if the materials were deemed \"impeachment only\" they would remain discoverable by a subpoena as exculpatory evidence. Where, as here, the government's proof depends almost entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of the accusers, \"impeachment\" evidence is material and discoverable in advance of trial. As discussed in Poventud v. City of New York, No. 07 CIV. 3998 DAB, 2015 WL 1062186, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2015),\n[I]mpeachment evidence constitutes exculpatory evidence that must be disclosed.
