In Requests 3 through 5, the Defendant seeks all communications between BSF and its co-counsel in a civil litigation against Maxwell (Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv-07433-LAP) \"between 2015 and the date of this subpoena about any meeting with the United States Attorney concerning Ghislaine Maxwell or _____.\" Certainly, some of these communications, if they exist, may fall under the work product umbrella if they were internal discussions with co-counsel. Moreover, BSF and its co-counsel have a common interest protection in their communications. The Defendant's overbroad Requests make it impossible for BSF to determine how many responsive communications would be protected and why. Again, it is the Defendant's burden to demonstrate that all of the communications she seeks would be relevant and admissible, and it is not BSF's burden to review broad swaths of material to determine what the Defendant is entitled to under Rule 17.\nC. Communications Between BSF and the Government Are Procurable from the Government.\nEven if Requests 1 through 5 could overcome Nixon's three hurdles, however, Requests 1 and 2 would still fail to the extent that they ask for communications with the Government, which the Defendant can procure from the Government.
