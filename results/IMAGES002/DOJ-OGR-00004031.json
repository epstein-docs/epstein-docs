As you are aware, the policies set forth for MDC Brooklyn legal visits do not allow for passing of any material during a legal visit. Due to our policy and procedures, the additional documents that were provided to Ms. Maxwell were confiscated. Those materials were put in an envelope and will be returned to you tomorrow upon your arrival to the institution.
