The USAO letters described the case as \"under investigation\" and stated that the victim would be notified \"[i]f anyone is charged in connection with the investigation.\" The letters stated that, in addition to their rights under the CVRA, victims were entitled to counseling, medical services, and potential restitution from the perpetrator, and that, upon request, the government would provide a list of counseling and medical services.278 Lastly, the letters advised that investigators for the defense might contact the victims and those who felt threatened or harassed should contact Villafaña or the FBI case agent.\n\nAlthough the USAO letters did not contain any language limiting CVRA rights to the post-arrest or indictment stage, Villafaña told OPR that she did not intend for the letters to activate the USAO's CVRA obligations, which she believed attached only after the filing of a criminal charge. Villafaña told OPR that she did not think that victims potentially receiving both an FBI letter and a USAO letter would be confused about their CVRA rights because the USAO letter \"was coming with an introduction from the agents [who were hand delivering them].\" Later, in the course of the CVRA litigation, Villafaña stated that she and the investigative team \"adopted an approach of providing more notice and assistance to potential victims than the CVRA may have required, even before the circumstances of those individuals had been fully investigated and before any charging decisions had been made.\"279\n\nVillafaña informed Lourie and Sloman about the letters, but the letters were not reviewed by any of Villafaña's supervisors, who considered such correspondence to be a non-management task.

The USAO's Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein's victims, and OPR's examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI's VNS data concerning the Epstein investigation.
