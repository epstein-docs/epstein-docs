I am working on that, and I'll address those issues in an order soon. In the meantime, I see the government agreed to make expert disclosures today, and the parties have agreed to dates for supplemental briefing of pretrial motions based only on what pertains to the S2 indictment, and I am fine with those proposals, and I think that's what you need in the immediate. With that, Ms. Comey, is there anything else the Court can address at this time? MS. COMEY: Nothing from the government, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim? MS. STERNHEIM: May I have a moment? THE COURT: You may. (Counsel conferring) MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, if I might ask that Mr. Pagliuca speak on one issue concerning the schedule. THE COURT: Okay. MR. PAGLIUCA: Good afternoon. THE COURT: Good afternoon. Just pull a little closer to the mic so I can hear you. MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor. This only has to do with what's been submitted to the Court as an agreed-upon motion in limine schedule. I want the Court to understand that SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
