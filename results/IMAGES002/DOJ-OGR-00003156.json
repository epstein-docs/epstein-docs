Moreover, the Rules do not describe—much less limit—what matters may be heard by what grand jury. Cf. SDNY Business Division Rule 6 (describing proceedings after an indictment has been returned). Rather, the Rules provide only that once an indictment is returned, \"[t]he U.S. attorney designates on the criminal cover sheet that the case is to be assigned to White Plains if the crime was allegedly committed in whole or in predominant part in the Northern Counties.\" SDNY Business Division Rule 18(b)). Furthermore, the Rules specifically contemplate that cases may be reassigned from one courthouse to another. SDNY Business Division Rule 19. Consistent with these Rules, it is common for cases to be indicted by grand juries sitting in the White Plains courthouse and tried in the Manhattan courthouse. See, e.g., United States v. Israel, 05 Cr. 1039 (CM), Dkt. No. 25; United States v. Cromitie, et al., 09 Cr. 558 (CM), Dkt. No. 183, 200; United States v. Annabi, 10 Cr. 07 (CM), Dkt. No. 45; United States v. Arici, 12 Cr. 24 (LAP), Dkt. No. 115, 117; United States v. Reeves, et al., 16 Cr. 372 (VEC), Dkt. No. 51; United States v. Guerrier, 18 Cr. 284 (JSR), Dkt. No. 98.\n\n2. The SDNY Jury Plan\n\nThe Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. § 1861 et seq. (the \"JSSA\"), provides the structure for the selection of juries in federal district courts. The JSSA requires each district to \"devise and place into operation a written plan for random selection of grand and petit jurors . . . .\" 28 U.S.C. § 1863(a). Each district in New York selects grand and petit juries pursuant to a plan adopted by the judges of the district and approved by the Judicial Conference of the Second Circuit. Id.; see also United States v. Bahna, 68 F.3d 19, 23 (2d Cir. 1995). The plan for the Southern District has been in place since February 2009.
