So remember, I know very little about the Maxwell case, both because it wasn't my case and, to the shock of nearly everyone that I talk to, we're all too busy to worry about some litigation that's being handled by somebody else; and second, it seems to have been litigated entirely under seal so how could I have found out anything about it.

Literally, everything.\n6\n7 So what assurance do I have that so broad a grand jury subpoena -- given that I have these competing interests between the terms of the protective order and the government's interest in conducting an investigation, what assurance do I have that you need all that stuff, that that's all somehow going to be relevant to your investigation?
