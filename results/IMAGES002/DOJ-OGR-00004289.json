(See Section I supra). The government cannot make a contrary showing. Accordingly, prosecuting Epstein for Counts Five and Six would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. And because Epstein negotiated immunity for Ms. Maxwell and any other \"potential co-conspirators\" as part of the terms of the NPA, Ms. Maxwell cannot be prosecuted for those crimes either. See United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 609 F.2d 603, 637 (2d Cir. 1979) (\"If [the defendant's] earlier plea is found to bar prosecution of him because of double jeopardy, since concededly the plea included an agreement to drop the charges against [his wife], the instant prosecution of [his wife] will also be barred.\") Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment must therefore be dismissed.\n\nIII. Counts Five and Six Are Time-Barred.\n\nCounts Five and Six should also be dismissed because they are time-barred by the applicable five-year statute of limitations under 18 U.S.C. § 3282. In its previous motions related to the S1 Indictment, the government asserted that the Mann Act counts (Counts One through Four) are timely because they are governed by 18 U.S.C. § 3283, which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations period for \"offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse ... of a child under the age of 18 years\" to \"during the life of the child.\" (Dkt. 204 at 24-26, 36-41). Ms. Maxwell argued that 18 U.S.C. § 3283 did not apply to the Mann Act offenses because they do not \"necessarily entail\" the sexual abuse of a minor and therefore are not \"offense[s] involving\" such conduct.
