In United States v. Dient, 775 F.3d 714 (5th Cir. 2015), the court found that 18 USC §3283's \"any offense involving sexual or physical abuse of kidnapping\" included the sexual exploitation offense at 18 U.S.C. §2251(a). To reach the finding the court avoided §3283's plain language and instead relied on a sexual abuse definition at 18 USC §3509(a)(8). Fifth Circuit \"under the definitions in §3509(a) using children to engage in sexually explicit conduct, including 'exploitation in the form of child pornography, constitutes \"sexual abuse\" of a child. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3509(a)(6), (a)(8).\" Since the plain language does not include Exploitation they use the sexual abuse definition at (a)(8) which includes the phrase \"other form of exploitation,\" as a work around. This solution however causes \"exploitation\" to be superfluous at the §3509(a) child definition, which keeps sexual abuse and exploitation separate. See United States v.
