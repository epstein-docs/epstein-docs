Bakhtiari, 913 F.2d 1053, 1057 (2d Cir. 1990) (\"This procedure enabled [the Court], upon finding that the defense failed as a matter of law, to preclude the evidence and thereby avoid unnecessary jury confusion.\"). If there is a question of whether a defense is sufficient as a matter of law, the Court may conduct a hearing. See Bakhtiari, 913 F.2d at 1057. But if the Court finds a defense insufficient as a matter of law, the Court is under no duty to allow the defendant to present the evidence, or advance the defense, to the jury. See Miles, 748 F.3d at 489; United States v. Paul, 110 F.3d 869, 871 (2d Cir. 1997) (citing United States v.
