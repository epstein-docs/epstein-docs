Villafaña and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges That They “Try to Work It Out”\n\nIn the late afternoon of Wednesday, September 19, 2007, Villafaña expressed her increasing frustration to her supervisors. She emailed the defense redline version of the plea agreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions she had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into the agreement.” (Emphasis in original). Villafaña opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.” Lourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”\n\nLourie immediately emailed Acosta the following:\n\nI looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkowitz] and I must agree with Marie. Based on my own conversations with him, his draft is out of left field. He claims to orally agree to our terms and then sends us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply tell him that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move forward with our case.\n\nAcosta replied:\n\nWhy don’t we just call him. Tell him\n\n1. You agree, and then change things.\n2. That’s not acceptable, and is in bad faith. Stop it or we’ll indict.\n3. Try to work it out.\n\nIt seems that we are close, and it[’]s worth trying to overcome what has to be painfully . . . annoying negotiating tactics.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he recognized,\n\n[t]his negotiation was a pain, but if it was the right position, the fact that you’ve got annoying counsel on the other side doesn’t it make it less of a right position. You tell them stop being annoying, you try to work it out, and if not, then you indict.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He also forwarded to Acosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafaña had sent to Lefkowitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafaña earlier that afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Villafaña sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft message she proposed to send to Lefkowitz with her objections to the defense revisions, explaining, “I know that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on\n\n76\n\nDOJ-OGR-00003278",
