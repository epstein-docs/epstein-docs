I wish that the Attorney General, whoever, head of the Bureau of Prisons and the leader of the Congress, would have heard that presentation. The single thing in the five years that I was chief judge of this court that made me the craziest was my complete and utter inability to do anything meaningful about the conditions at the MCC, especially at the MCC and the MDC, two federal correctional facilities located in the City of New York that are run by morons, which wardens cycle repeatedly, never staying for longer than a few months or even a year. So there is no continuity, there is no leadership, there is no ability to get anything done. They lurch from crisis to crisis, from the gun smuggling to Jeffrey Epstein, none of which is the fault of Ms. Days or any of the other inmates I have sentenced or will sentence. It is the finding of this Court that the conditions to which she was subjected are as disgusting, inhuman as anything I've heard about any Colombian prison, but more so because we're supposed to be better than that. So if I could, Ms. Days, I would say you've been punished enough, and I would send you home, but I can't. The law doesn't allow me to sentence you to less than five years. Some of what you've endured has been endured by prisoners even in well-run facilities, some of it. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00004766",
