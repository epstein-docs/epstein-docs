That estimate may change after the defense has had an opportunity to review the Government's witness and exhibit lists which were made available to defense counsel last night after the close of business.2 Additionally, as a general matter, the defense believes that the length of cross-examination is determined by the scope of the direct examination, not its length.\nJoint Position: Accordingly, the parties jointly request that the Court seat only jurors with availability beyond the Christmas holiday.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Attorney\nBy: /s\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Attorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (212) 637-2324\nCc: Defense counsel (By ECF)\n2 Ms. Maxwell has not yet been provided a copy of the Government's late-night disclosures because the Government was unwilling to hand-deliver a copy of their disclosures to MDC on the due date. The Government has informed defense counsel that that Ms. Maxwell may receive the materials some time later this week via mail. After the defendant has had an opportunity to review the disclosures and confer with counsel, the defense can update the Court with any anticipated changes to its defense-case projections.\nDOJ-OGR-00005204",
