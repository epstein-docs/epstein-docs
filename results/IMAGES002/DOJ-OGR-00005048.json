  "full_text": "Likewise, based on the Pottinger-Kramer emails and Relentless Pursuit details, it appears that Mr. Pottinger and Mr. Edwards were attempting to present [REDACTED] as a cooperator against Ms. Maxwell. Because the government's account of its interactions differs from the accounts of Mr. Edwards in his book and Mr. Pottinger in his emails, Ms. Maxwell seeks documents from these two attorneys concerning their interactions with the U.S. Attorney's Office, which we believe will directly rebut the government's claims made in their response to Ms. Maxwell's pre-trial motions. Likewise, Ms. Maxwell believes that Mr. Pottinger or Mr. Edwards is the \"source\" quoted in the NY Daily News concerning these meetings with the government, so she seeks their communications with the press concerning only Ghislaine Maxwell or any meetings with the US Attorney's Office. Items 6-9: Physical Evidence Concerning the Alleged Victims Mr. Edwards has identified himself as the attorney representing [REDACTED], [REDACTED]. At the February 29, 2016, meeting with Ms. Kramer, it appears that Mr. Edwards discussed both [REDACTED], as well as [REDACTED]. According to AUSA Kramer's notes of that meeting, Mr. Edwards referenced [REDACTED] by name and gave an account of [REDACTED] allegations that made no mention of Ms. Maxwell and was substantially different from the account contained in the Indictment. For example, the summary of [REDACTED] account is that she was [REDACTED]. Mr. Edwards also shared all of his \"notes\" with Julie Brown of the Miami Herald.",
