Oct. 12, 2021 Tr. at 7:14-8:1, United States v. Parnas, 19 Cr. 725 (JPO) (denying defense's request for a second day of jury selection to allow time for background research on potential jurors; no juror questionnaire used). Here, the time between the administration of the jury questionnaire, oral voir dire, and the start of trial is significantly more extended in light of, among other things, COVID-19 precautions.\nAs the Court has noted, the purpose of the jury questionnaire process is to streamline challenges for cause. Juror identities are not necessary for that process. The Government submits that having identifying information for jurors for weeks in advance of selection would be unusual, and is not necessary, because \"the purpose of the voir dire is to ascertain disqualifications, not to afford individual analysis in depth to permit a party to choose a jury that fits into some mold that he believes appropriate for his case.\" United States v. Barnes, 604 F.2d 121, 138 (2d Cir. 1979) (citations omitted). For similar reasons, the Government respectfully requests that peremptory challenges be exercised at the conclusion of voir dire and not on November 29, 2021, the day that trial is scheduled to commence.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court clarify for the parties when during the jury selection process the parties will be provided with the names of prospective jurors.\nDOJ-OGR-00005381",
