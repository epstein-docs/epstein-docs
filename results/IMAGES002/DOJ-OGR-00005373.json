(o) Do you know, or have you had any dealings, personal or business, with Jeffrey Epstein, or with any of his relatives or friends? [If Yes/Unsure, question privately] (p) Do you know, or have you had any dealings, personal or business, with Ms. Maxwell, or with any of her relatives or friends? [If Yes/Unsure, question privately] Requested Instruction Following Impaneling of the Jury 65. From this point until the time when you retire to deliberate your verdict, it is your duty not to discuss this case, and not to remain in the presence of other persons who may be discussing this case. The rule about not discussing the case with others includes discussions even with members of your own family, and your friends. 66. If at any time during the course of the trial, any person attempts to talk to you or to communicate with you about this case, either in or out of the courthouse, you should immediately report such an attempt to me through my deputy clerk. In this regard, let me explain to you that the attorneys and defendant in a case are not supposed to talk to jurors, not even to offer a friendly greeting. So, if you happen to see any of them outside this courtroom, they will, and should, ignore you. Please do not take offense. They will be acting properly by doing so. Commented [A20]: GOVERNMENT OBJECTION: The Government objects to Questions 65(o) and (p) proposed by the defendant on the grounds that the questions are duplicative of questions included in the proposed questionnaire. Jurors should be asked follow-up questions during voir dire as necessary, but need not be asked the same questions again. Commented [A21R20]: DEFENDANT RESPONSE: The defense responds that (a) the Court has not yet ruled on the admissibility of the questions on the questionnaire, and (b) asking the questions live when the jurors reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by the parties will aid in the selection of an impartial and fair jury. 15 DOJ-OGR-00005373",
