I might have missed something, but I think I've got 4 it fairly well under control. I would be pleased to hear 5 anything anybody wants to tell me in addition to what you've 6 already given me. 7 MS. MCCAWLEY: Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley. I 8 would like to start, if it's convenient with the Court, with 9 the pro hac vice motions that are pending because we would like 10 counsel to be able to anticipate in these proceedings. Would 11 that be all right if I started with that? 12 THE COURT: I don't care. 13 MS. MCCAWLEY: Thank you. Your Honor, you have before 14 you two pro hac vice motions. My client, Virginia Giuffre, 15 would like to have counsel of record in the case be added as 16 Professor Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards. We have presented 17 those pro hacs to your Honor. This is the first time in my 18 years of practice that I've had a contested one, so I've looked 19 at the case law surrounding that and I think it is very clear 20 that a client is entitled to counsel of choice in a case. 21 In this matter she has selected these lawyers. They 22 have been working with her. They had been working on this 23 matter for many months now. We need them as counsel of record 24 in the case now because we are going to have depositions 25 throughout the country where, for example, Professor Cassell is SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
