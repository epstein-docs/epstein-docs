NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. As detailed in the subpoena and Maxwell's moving papers, she seeks authorization to serve a subpoena to the law firm of Boies, Schiller and Flexner LLP. BSF has filed a letter in opposition to the subpoena request. Additionally, the Government submitted a letter requesting that it be given notice of all pending and future subpoenas applications, an opportunity to challenge them, and copies of any documents produced. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Maxwell's motion as to Requests 1 through 8 and Request 12 and reserves judgment on Requests 9 through 11. The Court also denies the Government's requests, though it will direct the Government to notify the Court of its views as to Requests 9 through 11.\n\nI. Legal Standard\n\nRule 17(c) permits subpoenas ordering the production of \"books, papers, documents, data, or other objects.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). When the subpoena seeks the production of personal or confidential information about a victim, it may be served on a third party only by court order. Fed. R. Crim.
