The names of persons who complete and return the questionnaire and are found to be qualified as a juror, unless granted an exception from jury service, are then placed on the qualified jury wheel from which potential jurors are summoned.\n23. What in this process could cause the difference in the percent African American and percent Hispanic between the benchmark and the qualified jury wheel? Below is a list of all likely possible causes of such a difference. In considering the differences, I view the process as moving sequentially from the voter registration lists to the qualified jury wheel, and I compare the absolute disparity in the percent African American and Hispanic at each step with that of the community.\n24.
