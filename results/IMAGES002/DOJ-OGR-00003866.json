Dkt. No. 207. The Court also granted severance as to the perjury counts. Both the denial of the motions to dismiss and the severance of the perjury counts are relevant to the requests for a bail hearing and for an adjournment of the trial date. The Court addresses both in this Order.\n\nFirst, the request for a renewed bail hearing is denied. The Court held an original bail hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive argument and presentation of information, the Court found that no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance as required, determining as a result that Maxwell was a flight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Dkt. No. 23. The Court based its conclusion on the presumption in favor of detention, 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3), and its weighing of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, the weight of the evidence, and Maxwell's history and characteristics. Since that time, Maxwell has twice sought reconsideration of the Court's original bail determination and offered different bail packages and proposed conditions of release. The Court carefully considered those requests and denied them in written Orders, concluding that none of the new information had any material bearing on the Court's original conclusion and that the Government again met its burden of establishing that Maxwell poses a substantial risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance as required. Dkt. Nos. 106, 169.\n\nMaxwell now seeks a new bail hearing at which \"witnesses [would] testify regarding the purported strength of the government's case.\" Dkt. No. 192 at 3. The request is denied. The S2 Indictment raises no issues that warrant reconsideration of the Court's prior bail determinations.\n\nOn the contrary, the new charges contained in the S2 indictment as well as the Court's resolution\n\nDOJ-OGR-00003866",
