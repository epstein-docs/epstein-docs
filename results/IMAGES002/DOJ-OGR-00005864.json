The ongoing relationships between the defendant, Epstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims' accounts of these events are necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.

(Def. Mot. 11 at 2). That is a non sequitur. Indictments are not documents that contain all of the Government's evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling argument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To the extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for sexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the defendant with conspiracies to arrange for \"sexual activity\" (Indictment ¶¶ 12, 18) and \"a commercial sex act\" (Id. ¶ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 403 balancing, because evidence of a rape is \"highly emotional and inflammatory.\" (Def.
