And I wasn't sure that that was specific enough in the submission that we made. But, we don't think it's tenable to stick to the motion in limine schedule based on the government's proposed disclosures. THE COURT: You're essentially seeking four weeks from disclosure to briefing on in limine. MR. PAGLIUCA: Exactly. THE COURT: And the government is proposing to give you two weeks. MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct. And it's less for the exhibits, because we only have, under the government's proposal, three days to respond with any motions in limine to exhibits. So, that's the difference that I wanted the Court to be aware of. THE COURT: I do see that. Thank you. Ms. Comey, there will undoubtedly be briefing. Counsel needs time to review whatever the volume of that material will be, the Court needs time to resolve the motions. Is the government amenable to eight weeks for that disclosure? MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the reason we've proposed 45 days is because, assuming the trial goes forward on July 12 as scheduled, the government wants to make sure that we have time to be careful and thorough in reviewing our files and making S O U T H E R N D I S T R I C T R E P O R T E R S, P.C.
