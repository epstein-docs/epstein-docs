It also has no physical abuse because as explained physical abuse is a part of 109A. This solution leaves all 2252/3 terms accounted for. Lockhart supra. Summary Whether or not the §3509(a)(e) definition of sexual abuse is used, child pornography / exploitation offenses are not included, and the repercussion of this should not be understated. There is compelling evidence showing the Justice Department has always been aware of it. As demonstrated, sexual exploitation is not included in \"sexual or physical abuse\" and sexual exploitation was removed from the proposals! Adding child pornography offense via §3509(a)(e) causes superfluity. Repose is mandated by Supreme Court precedent, if precedent means anything at all.
