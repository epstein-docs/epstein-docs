Given the number of other items that need to be taken care of between now and 45 days before trial, we proposed 45 days before trial because we are confident that we can complete a thorough review of voluminous files to make sure we have satisfied our disclosure obligations by that date. THE COURT: If we split the difference, they're saying eight weeks, you are saying six weeks. How about seven? MS. COMEY: Your Honor, whatever your Honor directs, we would certainly make our absolute best efforts. Our estimate is based on the volume of files that your Honor is aware we need to review. It is that we are confident and comfortable that we can make the disclosure 45 days before trial. THE COURT: I'm thinking of splitting that difference. The government has a lot to review to make sure it's making those disclosures fully. Whatever the volume of that material is, the defense has to have time to review it. This schedule, assuming trial stays in July, this is the schedule. If trial were to move, this is the same schedule. So, they don't get any more time to review the material, whatever happens with the trial date. And as I say, everyone should assume July. But I think, sounds like the government would be agreeable to a seven-week disclosure date. MS. COMEY: May I have a moment, your Honor? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
