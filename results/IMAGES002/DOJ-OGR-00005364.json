Do you understand that the prosecution has the burden of proof in this as in every other criminal case and that Ms. Maxwell has no burden of coming forward with any evidence to establish his innocence, but rather the prosecutor has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the truth of the allegations charged?\na. On the other hand, the defense may also produce evidence. Would you be able to follow the Court's instructions that even if Ms. Maxwell or her lawyers introduce evidence, the burden of proof never leaves the prosecution, and it is always the prosecutor that must prove the Ms. Maxwell guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?\nb. Do any of you believe evidence is more compelling or a case is more persuasive if it is presented by the federal government rather than a private party?\n16. The law provides that Ms. Maxwell, as the defendant, does not have to testify. Our laws further provide that if Ms. Maxwell does not testify, you may not consider that for any purpose in deciding her guilt or innocence. Is there anyone on this jury panel who, because of personal feelings or otherwise, would not be able to follow that rule?\n17. Does any member of the jury panel feel that if a defendant does not testify that she may be hiding something?\n18. Do any of you believe that a witness can swear to tell the truth and nonetheless not be completely truthful?\n19. Would any of you consider the testimony of a government agent more credible than that of an ordinary person?\n20. Would you be inclined to believe or disbelieve a witness solely because the witness is an FBI or law enforcement officer?\n6\nDOJ-OGR-00005364",
