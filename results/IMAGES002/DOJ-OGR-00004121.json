NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Court has considered the parties' proposals regarding the commencement of trial.\nDkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the Government's letter, the Court will request\nNovember 29, 2021 from the Clerk's Office as the trial start date—that is the date (pending\napproval from the Clerk's Office consistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening\nstatements will be made to the jury. However, the Court will also request from the Clerk's\nOffice that jury selection occur during the week of November 15. Counsel shall plan\naccordingly.\n\nThe Court grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2021.\nThe Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2021, outweigh the\ninterests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to\npermit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding\nindictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to\nmake and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allow adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. §\n3161(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2021.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00004121",
