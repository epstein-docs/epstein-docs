  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 112 of 349\n\nagreement. I know that Andy promised Chief Reiter an update when a resolution was achieved. . . . [The West Palm Beach manager] is calling, but [he] knows not to tell Chief Reiter about the money issue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and the amount of time that has been agreed to. [He] also is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafaña about this email. She explained that she generally kept confidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that \"the way that the [Epstein] case was resolved\" needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what happened because by the NPA's terms, they needed to know what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafaña emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter \"the good news\" but \"leave out the part about damages,\" and explained that she wanted to meet with the victims herself to explain how the damages provision would work. Villafaña also told him that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD Detective who had led the state investigation of Epstein. 129 Villafaña forwarded to Acosta, Lourie, and the West Palm Beach manager Lefkowitz's email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA from becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement \"already binds us not to make public except as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],\" and asked, \"[W]hat more does he want?\" Villafaña replied, \"My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.\" Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafaña, and the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss \"who we tell and how much,\" adding, \"Nice job with a difficult negotiation.\"\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his attorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafaña, contained the following pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment, plus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a registrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 30-month sentence divided as follows: consecutive terms of 12 months and 6 months in the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing and without community control or probation, followed by 12 months of community control, consecutive. 130\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims' status as victims. The USAO would provide to Epstein a list of individuals\n\n129 The West Palm Beach manager told OPR that he called Chief Reiter, who was \"fine\" with the outcome.\n\n130 Withholding adjudication or sentencing referred to a special sentence in which the judge orders probation but does not formally convict the defendant of a criminal offense. See Fla. Stat. § 948.01 (2007).\n\n85\n\nDOJ-OGR-00004409",
