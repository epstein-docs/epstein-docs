In the S1 Indictment, the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three were confined to a four-year period from 1994-1997, which the Court found was not covered by the NPA. (Dkt. 207 at 6-7). In the S2 Indictment, by contrast, the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three cover a much broader timeframe from 1994-2004 because they incorporate the same conduct from 2001-2004 involving Accuser-4 charged in Counts Five and Six. As previously discussed, the NPA bars the government from prosecuting Ms. Maxwell for these offenses. Hence, as currently charged, the government could offer inadmissible evidence excluded by the NPA as proof of Counts One and Three. It would be impermissible for the jury to consider such evidence in connection with Counts One and Three and any guilty verdict based on proof related to Accuser-4, or any other conduct covered by the NPA, might require reversal.
