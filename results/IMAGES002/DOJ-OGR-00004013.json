Requests 10 and 11: Boots and Photographs As to Requests 10 and 11, for boots that Epstein and the Defendant purchased for Annie Farmer and various photographs, the Defendant complains that \"the government has scrupulously avoided actually obtaining\" this evidence. Resp. Ltr. at 11. But, as explained above, Rule 17 is not a tool that can be used to circumvent discovery disputes with the Government. BSF is a private entity with no Brady or other constitutional obligations to the Defendant, and a subpoena to BSF cannot be used to replace discovery appropriately aimed at the Government under Rule 16 or to avoid resolving discovery disputes with the Government. In any event, the photographs are not \"admittedly relevant\" and the Defendant has not explained how they would be relevant and admissible as trial. Resp. Ltr. at 11. The photographs do not portray any event described in the indictment. Instead, the photographs depicted in Exhibit C to the Subpoena that the Defendant seeks are as follows: AFARMER00010470; AFARMER00011691; AFARMER00011692 Photographs of Annie Farmer prior to a high school dance, produced in Farmer v.

AFARMER00011688; AFARMER00011690 Photographs of Annie Farmer in Thailand, produced in Farmer v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10475 (LGS-DCF). AFARMER00011689; AFARMER00011693; AFARMER00011694 Photographs of Annie Farmer and a friend in high school, produced in Farmer v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10475 (LGS-DCF).
