May - June 2007: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submitted the prosecution memorandum, Villafaña intended to file charges by May 15, 2007, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafaña, however, had not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to analyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging strategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that the FBI was planning a press conference for May 15, Sloman advised Villafaña that \"[t]his Office has not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.\"\n\nOn May 10, 2007, with Menchel's concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafaña's prosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterbaan, who in turn sent it to his deputy and another CEOS attorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and describing it as a \"highly sensitive\" case involving \"a high profile, very rich defendant.\" After CEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterbaan responded to Lourie with an email stating that the memorandum was \"exhaustive\" and \"well done\" and noting that Villafaña \"has correctly focused on the issues as we see them.\" He summarized CEOS's analysis of the application of key facts to the statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafaña's assessments but noting that further research was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant's knowledge of victims' ages. Oosterbaan offered to assign a CEOS attorney to work with Villafaña on the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterbaan's email to Menchel and Villafaña.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails show that Lourie, at least, was already considering an early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.

After the federal investigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2006, Epstein largely stayed away from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\n39 Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterbaan was an AUSA at the USAC for about ten years and was good friends with Lourie.\n\n40 In her prosecution memorandum, Villafaña argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it \"may undermine our arguments for pretrial detention.\" Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening a bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n\n27\n\nDOJ-OGR-00004351",
