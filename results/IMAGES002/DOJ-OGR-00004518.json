In particular, the 2005 Guidelines required the responsible official to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims' views about, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2005 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to \"consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the victim's] views\" in light of various factors such as \"[w]hether the proposed plea involves confidential information on conditions\" and \"[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant's right to a fair trial.\" Lastly, the 2005 Guidelines stated that \"[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather than withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.\"\n\nThe \"corrections stage\" involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration following a conviction.
