Later that day, Villafaña met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 31 individuals the government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\nIn her 2015 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, \"I did not have any reason to attend that hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI's investigation of Epstein's abuse of me.\" She stated that she \"would have attended and tried to object to the judge and prevent that plea from going forward,\" had she known that the state plea \"had some connection to blocking the prosecution of my case.\" Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 stated that \"no one notified me that [Epstein's] plea had anything to do with my case against him.\"\nAn attorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had subpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 30, 2008, in order to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of one of his clients.
