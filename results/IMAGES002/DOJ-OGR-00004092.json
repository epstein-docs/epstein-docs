Based on prior discussions with defense counsel and the U.S. Attorney's, the MDC Brooklyn is only permitted to accept external hard drives which were loaded and certified by the U.S. Attorney's Office. However, after internal discussions, we are not opposed to accepting the external hard drive from defense counsel. It is our position that there is no need for an Order, as MDC will be working with Defense on acceptance of the hard drive. We will be in contact with defense counsel in coordinating acceptance of the delivery. Please let us know if the Court requires any additional information, which we will be happy to provide.
