Eye masks are not available for purchase in commissary and are not issued to inmates and, therefore, are considered contraband. The defendant is permitted, however, to use non-contraband items to cover her eyes at night.\nShould the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic, the Government will promptly confer with legal counsel at MDC and provide additional information.\nRespectfully submitted,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Attorney\nBy: s/\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Attorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nCc: Defense Counsel (By ECF)\n1 The MDC has determined the defendant's current housing assignment based, in part, on her concerns about being housed in the general population and as an alternative to her being housed in the SHU.
