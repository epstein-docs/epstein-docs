The parties have conferred in accordance with the Court's April 16, 2021 Order. The parties do not seek any redactions as to Reply Briefs 1 and 5 and, accordingly, the defense will file those reply briefs on the public docket. As to Exhibit A to Reply Brief 1, the Government respectfully submits that the exhibit should be filed entirely under seal in order to protect the privacy interests of victims and third parties. The defense has indicated that it has no objection to filing Exhibit A on the public record. As to Reply Brief 3, the Government respectfully requests that the Court adopt the redactions the defense had originally proposed on page 3 on March 15, 2021, which are narrowly tailored to cover information implicating the personal privacy interests of victims and third parties.
