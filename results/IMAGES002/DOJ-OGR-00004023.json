Nothing in Ms. Maxwell's legal papers was given to her by me or by Leah Saffian, Esq. Both Ms. Saffian and I dispute these allegations in the strongest terms.\nToday, Ms. Saffian and I met with Ghislaine Maxwell for a scheduled legal visit- under the gaze of 5 guards and a portable camera recording audio and video.\nAfter the legal visit concluded and Ms. Saffian and I left the visiting area, guards accused Ms. Maxwell of possessing documents obtained from counsel. The guards seized confidential documents from her, including documents she had previously received in legal mail delivered to the MDC and given to her by MDC staff. After seizing \"highly confidential\" documents (subject to a protective order that your staff is not authorized to review) and work product, the guards began reading the documents and have not returned them to Ms. Maxwell.\nAt no time did the guards, who were assiduously watching and filming the legal conference, bring any concern to my attention, so it is quite telling that you have been contacted when counsel are told that legal staff are unavailable during the weekend.\nNo documents were given to Ms. Maxwell for her retention. Demand is hereby made for an immediate identification of the documents you claim were not in Ms. Maxwell's possession upon entering the legal visiting area in advance of the arrival of counsel, a list of all guards present during the visit, and a copy of the video recording.\nPlease immediately return the confiscated legal documents to Ms. Maxwell. They are her documents, not mine. The confiscation of these documents has deprived Ms. Maxwell of her time and seriously impaired her ability to review legal documents and prepare for an upcoming trial, adding to an already difficult situation.\nThis matter is being reported to the Court and legal action will be initiated.\nRegarding tomorrow- I have received 15 different confirmations and cancellations regarding the scheduled visit for tomorrow, which will be attended by Ms. Saffian alone.\nI am sorting through these emails to determine what time period is permitted for tomorrow's visit.\nBobbi\n\nBOBBI C.
