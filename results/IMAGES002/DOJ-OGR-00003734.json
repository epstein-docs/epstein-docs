Petitioners do not contend that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4's \"participation in this case\" can only be achieved by listing them as parties.\n\nAs it stands under the original petition, the merits of this case will be decided based on a determination of whether the Government violated the rights of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all \"other similarly situated victims\" under the CVRA.
