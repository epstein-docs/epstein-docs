That is not a prejudicial simplification—that is the trial.\nThere is nothing unreliable, irrelevant, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio's opinion on coercion and attachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the relevant literature, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand witness testimony. That is all Rule 702's gatekeeping requirements demand.\n2. Dr. Rocchio's Opinion on the Relationship Between Trust and Victim Awareness of Their Abuse is Admissible\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio's testimony about how victims process their abuse and how that can prevent or delay disclosure. As the Government set forth in its expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\nThe relationship of trust and attachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 1 at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio's other opinions about the relationship between attachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop relationships of trust and attachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion. This opinion adds that, as part of this relationship, victims may not recognize that they are experiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this relationship, and therefore may not disclose their abuse or recognize the consequences of their abuse until later in life. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio's opinions about coercion and attachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at 12). Just as those are reliable, so is this one.\n22\nDOJ-OGR-00005806",
