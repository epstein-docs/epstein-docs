Among the multitude of rationales for the rule, rarely, if ever, will a lawyer be able to effectively serve as an advocate and give testimony:\n\nA lawyer who intermingles the functions of advocate and witness diminishes his effectiveness in both roles.

Testimony from Colorado Counsel would likely include their knowledge about the many false statements made by Giuffre and the actions of her lawyers including discovery abuses. But operating in a dual capacity, lawyer and witness, would create confusion, subject Ms. Maxwell's lawyers to cross-examination, and potentially constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, courts in this Circuit do not allow attorneys to function in this dual role, even if the defendant is willing. See United States v.
