Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\n\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allow the Government to prosecute her now for conduct that occurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the power to set a lengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the difficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a defendant's interest in repose. Maxwell's fairness argument is a gripe with Congress's policy judgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that ยง 3283 allows her prosecution now.\n\nB. The Government's delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n\"As the Supreme Court stated in United States v.
