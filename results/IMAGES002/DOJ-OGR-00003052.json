Aside from rank speculation loosely premised on an anonymously sourced news report, the defendant offers nothing to support her assertion that “Boies Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution” (Def. Mot. 3 at 2) (emphasis in original), or that AUSA-1’s February 2016 meeting with Boies Schiller (as it actually occurred) undercut the accuracy of the Government’s representations to Chief Judge McMahon, or played any role in the Government opening its investigation in November 2018.\n91\nDOJ-OGR-00003052",
