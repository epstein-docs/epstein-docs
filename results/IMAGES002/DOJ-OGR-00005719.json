The documents contain an unexplained notation, \"P.B., 2004-2005\" the only potential (hearsay) date referenced in the documents. There is no evidence to suggest that these documents were created or maintained by Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, there is no evidence to suggest that these documents were created or maintained by anyone. It is entirely probable that whatever the documents are they were manipulated or manufactured by Mr. Rodriguez in an effort to get a $50,000 payday. United States v.
