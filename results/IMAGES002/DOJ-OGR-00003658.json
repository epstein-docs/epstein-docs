While the government cites several cases in which courts have applied the 2003 Amendment to pre-enactment conduct, the only court to do so after analyzing congressional intent under the two-step framework required by Landgraf v.

No court has applied the Landgraf framework, considered the legislative history, and still concluded that Congress intended the 2003 Amendment to overcome the presumption against retroactivity, as the government asks this Court to do.\n\nBecause Congress' clear rejection of a retroactivity provision in the 2003 Amendment constitutes an express prescription of the amendment's temporal reach, the 2003 Amendment does not apply retroactively, and the Landgraf analysis ends at step one.
