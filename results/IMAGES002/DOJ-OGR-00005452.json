We have requested that within a month of commencement of trial, government disclosures be hand delivered to the MDC to alleviate delivery delays. The government has declined this request, again claiming resource issues. There is no assurance that Ms. Maxwell will receive legal mail - critical to trial preparation - in a timely manner. This is yet another example of how pretrial detention is encumbering Ms. Maxwell's ability to prepare for trial and interfering with her ability to effectively communicate with counsel. This should undermine the Court's confidence that Ms. Maxwell and her attorneys will be fully able to prepare for trial.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n/s/\nBOBBI C.
