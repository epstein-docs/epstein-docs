Alex and I believe that this is as far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB tomorrow . . . .\"\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkowitz sent Acosta a three-page letter reiterating the Epstein team's disagreements with the USAO's interpretation of the NPA. Lefkowitz noted, however, that Epstein had \"every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,\" and that the defense letter was not intended to be \"a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].\" Lefkowitz added:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during our October 12 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with regard to this matter, and assured me that your Office would not intervene with the State Attorney's Office regarding this matter; or contact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this matter; and that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long as Mr. Epstein's sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the Agreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the letter to Villafaña, commenting, \"Wait [until] you see this one.\" Villafaña replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret this agreement.\n\n. . . .\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence far lower than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry [Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in entering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an attorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don't do that, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected attorney to \"cold call\" the girls.\n\n146 The defense raised issues concerning the attorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and inclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-00004416",
