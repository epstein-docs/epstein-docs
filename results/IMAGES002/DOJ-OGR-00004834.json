He later testified that he did not have any specific recollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be surprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made this type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that in a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Attorney's office, someone would attempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil case. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he intended to prosecute the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm that he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was unable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a second, signed press release on February 17, 2005. Mr. Castor testified that he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand's attorneys in order to bind the Commonwealth so it \"would be evidence that they could show to a civil judge that Cosby is not getting prosecuted.\" The press release stated, \"After reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham Detectives, the District Attorney finds insufficient, credible and admissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Mr. Castor testified that this language made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be prosecuted, \"[s]o I used the present tense, [exists], . . . So I'm making it absolute. I said I found that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and admissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby] could be sustained. And the use of 'exists' and 'could' I meant to be absolute.\"\n\nThe press release specifically cautioned the parties that the decision could be revisited, \"District Attorney Castor cautions all parties to this matter that he will reconsider this decision should the need arise.\" He testified that inclusion of this sentence, warning that the decision could be revisited, in the paragraph about a civil case and the use of the word \"this,\" was intended to make clear that it applied to the civil case and not to the prosecution. Mr. Castor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if they criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms. Constand's actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper her civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not viable \"I operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up the dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to testify.\" He included the language \"much exists in this investigation that could be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-100-2020]- 21\n\nDOJ-OGR-00004834",
