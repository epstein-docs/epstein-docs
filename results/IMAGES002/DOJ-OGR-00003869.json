Does defense counsel continue to seek an adjournment of the July 12th start date for trial on the non-perjury counts?\n\n2. If the answer to question 1 is yes, what is the specific request being made as to length of adjournment? In particular, is the request for a 90-day adjournment? An adjournment until January 2022? Or something else? The Court requires a specific request be made and justified or it will not be considered.\n\nIf Maxwell continues to seek an adjournment, the Government may submit any response by 5:00 pm on April 22, 2021. The Court will consider the submissions and resolve expeditiously. As noted, however, unless and until an adjournment is specifically requested and granted, the parties shall assume that the Court will request a jury selection date as close to July 12th as possible and shall plan accordingly.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDated: April 20, 2021\nNew York, New York\n\nALISON J.
