At the time, Villafaña was notified by the AUSAs handling the matter that they \"had never heard of\" Epstein and he was providing \"absolutely no cooperation\" to the government. In 2011, Villafaña reported to senior colleagues that \"this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of it is true.\" Villafaña told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New York was \"completely false.\" Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein cooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an \"intelligence asset.\"244\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record attesting that Epstein was not a cooperating witness in a federal matter, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating witness or \"intelligence asset,\" or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR's investigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a basis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein's purported cooperation, or even a suggestion that he had assisted in a different matter, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense counsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have omitted any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR's investigation provided Epstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal investigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for cooperation in any matter.\n\nV.
