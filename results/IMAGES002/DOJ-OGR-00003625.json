Thus, the decision to not draw a proper random sample accounts for 0.68% of the absolute disparity between the actual master jury wheel and a random sample master jury wheel for African Americans and 0.82% of the absolute disparity for Hispanics. 8. Based on the geocoding of the master jury wheel, it is evident that the percentage of African Americans and Hispanics of the actual White Plains master jury wheel is similar to the estimate of the percentage of African Americans and Hispanics in the White Plains community. The percent African American of the master jury wheel is 1.25 percentage points lower than that of the community, (12.45% versus 11.20%) and the percent Hispanics of the master jury wheel is 1.15 percentage points lower than that of the community (14.12% versus 12.97%). 9. Mr. Martin notes that the disparity between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel is impacted by a clerical error in transcribing the individual's mailing address. This clerical error affected every county except Westchester. However, the impact of this clerical error on the absolute difference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for the African American percentage is negligible, and the error actually reduced the absolute difference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for African Americans and Hispanics. 10. In sum, as (i) the voter registration lists and the master jury wheel created from these lists reasonably mirror the representation of the community (an absolute disparity equal to or less than 1.25%), but (ii) because African Americans and Hispanics were less likely to respond to the questionnaire used to determine if the potential juror was qualified, and/or (iii) because African Americans and Hispanics who responded were less likely to be found qualified, and/or (iv) because African Americans and Hispanics who were found qualified were more likely to be excused, the absolute disparity between the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the White",
