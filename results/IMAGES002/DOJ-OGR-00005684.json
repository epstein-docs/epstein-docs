In the alternative, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court (1) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a \"minor\" or asserting that she was a \"minor\" at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from representing that she was \"sexually abused\" by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction concerning Accuser-3's testimony that includes the points discussed above.\n\nDated: October 18, 2021\nNew York, New York\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n/s/ Christian R.
