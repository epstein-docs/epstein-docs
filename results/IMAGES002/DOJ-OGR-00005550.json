AK doesn't recall ever affirmatively following up with Sean, but she took the radio silence to mean that the FBI agents in Florida did not express dissatisfaction.\n\n* No investigation was opened as a result of the February 29, 2016 meeting.\n* No investigation into Epstein was opened while AK was the Human Trafficking Coordinator and Project Safe Childhood coordinator.\n* AK never met with any other Boies Schiller attorneys. AK does not recall ever speaking with David Boies at any point.\n* AK never met with the attorneys from the February 29, 2016 meeting again.\n* When asked what, if any, communications AK had with the attorneys, AK noted that she sees an email from May 2016 with Stan Pottinger. AK believes it's possible Stan called AK, but she does not remember that.\n* AK does not recall any further conversations re Epstein in SDNY until much later when the Miami Herald series was published.\n\nAK confirmed she has read the Daily News Article LP sent\n\n* AK indicated that the article did not accurately describe AK's interactions with attorneys for Virginia Roberts.\n* AK's recollection is not that attorneys urged SDNY to open an investigation into \"the duo.\" They were focused on Epstein. Maxwell was mentioned in passing, not as a target.\n* AK did not participate in a second meeting with anyone. Had there been a meeting on this subject in the summer of 2016 in SDNY, AK would have known about it in her capacity as Human Trafficking Coordinator.\n\t* AK had been in that role since approximately 2010, and if someone came in to meet with a unit chief about a potential human trafficking matter, AK would get contacted about the meeting. AK met with chiefs to gather information about any cases they had that touched on human trafficking so that AK could coordinate. So if a second meeting had taken place with a supervisor in the office, AK would have known about it. Dan Stein also would have brought AK in if he learned of a second meeting.\n\t* AK would have made a record if there had ever been a second meeting. AK would remember if there were a second meeting. She has no record and no memory of any second meeting.\n* AK does not recall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life, so to her knowledge, Boies was not making any effort to persuade SDNY to investigate Epstein. AK noted it is possible Boies could have been on the phone if Stan Pottinger called AK in or around May of 2016, but AK has no recollection of such a call.\n* AK does not recall the attorney presentation being framed on highlighting Maxwell's assistance with Epstein's sexual abuse. It was not presented as a \"duo.\" AK recalls the mention of a pilot and the mention of someone having an address book, so other people were mentioned as part of telling the story of Epstein.\n\n4\nSDNY_GM_02742890\nDOJ-OGR-00005550",
