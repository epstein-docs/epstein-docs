Acosta told OPR, however, that he recognized that Villafaña and Lourie needed \"some degree of discretion to negotiate\"; that \"in the give and take\" of negotiations, they might propose a concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein ultimately pled \"captured the conduct\" in an \"appropriate\" way.\n\nAlthough Epstein's attorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county facility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein's attorneys alternately expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state resolution, the USAO and Epstein's counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence running concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge. Later that day, Villafaña sent Lefkowitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with Acosta and Sloman, and they were \"all satisfied in principle with the agreement.\"109 The next day, September 13, 2007, Villafaña sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors, identifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafaña also emailed defense counsel, stating that she had been \"spending some quality time with Title 18\"—referring to the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a \"factual basis\" for any federal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC.

Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was reduced. Villafaña and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafaña told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it going to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it going to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there was no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehow it ended up being 20 months and then it got to be 18 months.
