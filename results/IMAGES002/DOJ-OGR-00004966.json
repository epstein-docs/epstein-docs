Sternheim, second from left, along with her sister Isabel Maxwell, far left, during her arraignment on a superceding indictment, Friday, April 23, in New York. (Elizabeth Williams/AP) A thin Ghislaine Maxwell made her first in-person court appearance Friday, nearly a year after her arrest for allegedly luring victims into Jeffrey Epstein's underage sex trafficking trap. Maxwell, 59, walked stiffly into the Manhattan federal courtroom sporting a blue jail uniform. She had gray roots showing in her shoulder-length black hair. The British socialite, worth more than $20 million, chatted with her defense attorneys and stared straight ahead, showing no obvious signs of the torture she claims to be enduring in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-ghislaine-maxwell-arraignment-20210423-b3aza5eh7bddna7r247px2yb7e-story.html 2/10 DOJ-OGR-00004966",
