And, once again, the government has turned a blind eye to the existence of the journal, refusing to collect clearly relevant and exculpatory evidence.\nThis type of evidence, \"journals,\" or \"diaries\" is, without question, exculpatory material that the government would have to provide to the defense in advance of trial if it were in their possession. The government's failure to obtain the journal contravenes Second Circuit law: If the diary had contained exculpatory information or other material that would have been useful to the defense for the purpose of impeaching [the witness's] credibility, the government would have been required under Brady v. Maryland, supra, to turn over such material to the defense. See, e.g., United States v. Seijo, 514 F.2d 1357 (2d Cir. 1975). By allowing a potential source of such material to remain in the possession of the very witness whose credibility it might be used to impeach, the government created a serious risk that significant material would be destroyed or tampered with.[4]Under the circumstances, the diary should have been impounded with the court, subject to use and inspection by both sides under conditions that would protect the defendants from destruction or alteration, and the witness from unwarranted invasions of privacy or disclosure of information that might jeopardize his safety. Under no circumstances should the diary have been returned to the unsupervised possession of the witness.\nUnited States v. Cheung Kin Ping, 555 F.2d 1069, 1079 (2d Cir. 1977); see also White v. McKinley, 519 F.3d 806, 810, 814 (8th Cir. 2008) (where diary contained no entries related to the defendant's alleged sexual abuse the failure to preserve the diary deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial); United States v.
