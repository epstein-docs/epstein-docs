In August 2009, Villafaña alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of his home detention—he had been spotted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police, he claimed that he was walking \"to work\" at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafaña passed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.188 By letter dated September 1, 2009, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO's agreement to transfer supervision of the community control phase of Epstein's sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein maintained his \"primary residence.\" In response, Villafaña notified Black that the USAO opposed such a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with Dershowitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of Epstein's community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein's supervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on July 21, 2010.\n\n186 See \"Out of Prison,\" New York Post, July 23, 2009.\n187 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafaña, \"We're the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case] . . . .

We've since learned that he is pretty unsavory.\" Villafaña reported to Sloman and other supervisors that she \"just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of] New York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a low sentence because he was cooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.\" In a second email, she confirmed, \"There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.\"\n188 Black later wrote a letter to Villafaña claiming that Epstein had \"specific authorization to walk to work,\" the distance between his home and office was \"less than three miles,\" and when the matter was \"fully investigated,\" Epstein was found to be in \"total compliance\" with the requirements of his sentence.\n\n118\nDOJ-OGR-00003320",
