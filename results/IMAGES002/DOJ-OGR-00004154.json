Moreover, by the time AUSA told Judge McMahon that, for all he knew, the deposition transcripts would show \"page after page of people taking the Fifth,\" it was already a matter of public record that Maxwell had been deposed and that she had not invoked the Fifth Amendment. Ex. Q, p 1.\n\nThe government's argument also defies logic. The government was asking Judge McMahon to authorize a subpoena of Boies Schiller's entire file. At a minimum, the government had to have asked Boies Schiller about the size of the file and issues related to privilege to determine if Boies Schiller would contest the subpoena or notify either the civil court or Maxwell when the subpoena was issued and responsive documents produced. In fact, the government issued two subpoenas to Boies Schiller: the first for material covered by the Protective Order, and the second for material outside the Protective Order's reach.
