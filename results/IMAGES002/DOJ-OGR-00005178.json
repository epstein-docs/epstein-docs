NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Court is currently in the process of planning logistics for trial in this matter and requires the parties' best and current estimate of length of trial. The Court plans to have the jury sit 5 days a week from 9am until 5pm. Given that jury selection will be complete by November 19 and opening statements will occur on November 29, the Court requests that the parties provide their best estimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations. This will allow the Court to assess the likelihood that trial may continue after the Christmas holiday and therefore whether the jury may be required to sit some days during the week between Christmas and New Year's Day. Accordingly, on or before October 12, 2021, the parties are ORDERED to confer and submit a joint letter with their best and current estimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDated: October 5, 2021 New York, New York\n\nALISON J.
