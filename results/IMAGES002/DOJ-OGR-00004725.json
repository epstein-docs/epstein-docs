In her current motion, the defendant offers no additional factual claims in support of her argument that the passage of time has prejudiced her defense. She instead refers the Court back to her prior hypothetical, vague, and conclusory claims of prejudice that do not withstand scrutiny. The defendant has not remotely carried her \"heavy burden\" of proof. Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752. Her renewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment delay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\nBecause the defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the Court need not address the defendant's specious arguments that the Government's purpose in any alleged pre-indictment delay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage.

Mot. at 22). The defendant's argument that the Government acted in bad faith—to the extent she is making such an argument—is based on no evidence whatsoever, and for good reason; it is not true.\nAs the Government has previously explained (see Dkt.
