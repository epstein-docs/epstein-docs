Plaintiff's allegations were not a part of their investigation, which took place years after Plaintiff left the country. Moreover, their investigation did not involve Ms. Maxwell. Again, such duplicative and irrelevant deposition testimony speaks to the intended purpose of the ten-deposition limit, not a reason to exceed that limit.\n\nThe same holds true for Nadia Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensigton or Sarah Vickers) and Jeffrey Epstein, each of whom Plaintiff anticipates will not respond to questions and invoke their Fifth Amendment right. As discussed above, such invocation has no bearing on the issues in this matter. Moreover, it is obviously cumulative and duplicative.\n\nPlaintiff also identifies Rinaldo Rizzo and Jean Luc Brunel but fails to provide any information from which Ms. Maxwell or the Court could identify the subject matter of their expected testimony. Thus, it is unclear how these individuals have information that differs from or would add to the other proposed deponents. It is the Plaintiff's burden to explain to the Court why these depositions should be permitted if they exceed the presumptive limit, why the information would not be cumulative, and its relevance to the important issues in the action, or the importance of the discovery in resolving those issues. She simply fails to provide any information by which the Court can assess these factors, and thus should not be permitted to exceed the deposition limit based on her proffer.\n\nIII. THE TESTIMONY SOUGHT IS IRRELEVANT TO THIS SINGLE COUNT DEFAMATION CASE\n\nThis case is a simple defamation case. Plaintiff, through her counsel, filed a pleading making certain claims regarding \"Jane Doe No. #3\" - the Plaintiff - and her alleged",
