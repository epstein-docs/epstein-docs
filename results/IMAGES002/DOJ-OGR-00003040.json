Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, attempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary, the Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was not applicable, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the courts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was attempting to \"circumvent\" a case that it cited 11 times in its argument to both relevant courts. (See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in connection with its investigation and made an application to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) protective orders that precluded full compliance with those subpoenas.
