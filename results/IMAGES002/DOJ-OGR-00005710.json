United States, 353 U.S. 391, 401-02, 404 & n.16 (1957)).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, and consistent with its prior ruling on severance, the Court should exclude from evidence any statements made by Ms. Maxwell at her 2016 civil depositions and any other evidence related to the severed perjury counts. The Court should further redact from the superseding indictment the perjury counts (¶¶ 28-31) and the allegations that Ms. Maxwell provided false statements at her depositions to “conceal” her involvement in Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes (¶¶ 2 (second sentence), 10).
