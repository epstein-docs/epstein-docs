She has refused to identify when these individuals\n3 began their representations, the nature of the representations.\n4 THE COURT: There is a little confusion here, at least\n5 in my mind, as to what we are talking about. I certainly\n6 understand the two gentlemen whose applications I have just\n7 dealt with and the third person, who I take it is affiliated\n8 with the Boies firm.\n9 Obviously, over time the plaintiff has probably\n10 conferred with other lawyers. But who cares? Let's assume she\n11 has talked to 20 more lawyers. You want all those retainers?\n12 That doesn't make any sense. What is the universe we are\n13 talking about?\n14 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I certainly understand all\n15 of the members of the Boies firm that currently represent her.\n16 The third individual, if I understand correctly, is a gentleman\n17 by the name of Stan Pottinger. He is a lawyer of some renown.\n18 He is also an author of best-selling books.
