The phrases \"does not recall,\" \"does not remember,\" or some similar expression of lack of memory appear at least thirty-two times in the notes of the government’s 2021 call with AUSA . Id.\nMany of AUSA disclaimers, however, are simply not credible. For example, AUSA claimed not to “have an independent memory of the Giuffre v. Maxwell [defamation] lawsuit being mentioned” during the meeting, id. at 1, even though her notes are replete with references to the lawsuit, Ex. J. After reviewing her notes, AUSA denied that they refreshed her memory. Ex.

Take just one example. “To [her] knowledge,” AUSA said, she did “not receive[] any discovery materials from any civil case.” Ex. K, p 6. That is not correct. The government admits that AUSA received from Giuffre’s attorneys, and turned over to AUSA and others in the office, including flight records and Palm Beach Police Department Records.
