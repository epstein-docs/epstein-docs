Nobody's had visitors. People have gotten locked up all over the country in the SHU when they've gotten sick, and you had the great misfortune to not only to get Covid but to get Covid in the earliest days, when we didn't know what we were doing. And that being so, I think you've suffered triply as a result. But there is no excuse for the conditions in those two institutions. There is no excuse for the serial leadership that does not allow the office of warden to take control and get control of those facilities, that they just cycle through, most of them at the end of their careers, and it is unfair and unjust. You shouldn't have to suffer for the incompetence of the United States Department of Justice and its subsidiary agency, the Bureau of Prisons. I will do what I can to bring your situation to the people who, if they give a damn, might do something. You have committed a serious crime under circumstances that were particularly difficult for me to swallow what was done and everything, but I am convinced that no good would be served by keeping you incarcerated for one minute more than I am required to do by law. And so I conclude that a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months is hardly any different from the guidelines lower end sentence of 63 months. It is sufficient but not greater than necessary to punish you for your sins. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00004767",
