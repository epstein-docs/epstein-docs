Finally, Villafaña pointed out that Epstein's purported \"supervisor\"—who as the Foundation's vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation's president—had promised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the \"supervisor\" lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor Epstein's activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknowledged nor responded to Villafaña's letter.\n\nIn March 2009, Sloman met in Miami with Dershowitz for, as Dershowitz characterized it in a subsequent email, \"a relaxed drink and conversation,\" which included a discussion of the Epstein case. After that encounter, Dershowitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for Sloman's \"assurance that the feds will not interfere with how the Palm Beach sheriff administers\" Epstein's sentence \"as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.\" Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Attorney's Office will not interfere with how the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the sentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean that the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the terms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean that, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or in-home detention, we will not object. To be clear, if contacted Mr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent to PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or home detention.\n\nA week later, Dershowitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for Sloman's \"willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position on how he handled Epstein's sentence,\" as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but adding, \"[L]et's put any call off for a while.\"\n\nEpstein's sentence required that he be confined to his home for a 12-month period following his release from prison. On July 22, 2009, almost 13 months after he began serving his sentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.185 At this time, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2009, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York's investigation of investment bank Bear Stearns, and that he had been released early from his 18-month imprisonment term because of that cooperation.\n\n185 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision program. Florida Statute § 948.001(3) defines the program as \"a form of intensive, supervised custody in the community.\"\n\n117\nDOJ-OGR-00003319",
