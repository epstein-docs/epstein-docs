The Court Should Reject the Government's Attempts to Preview any Defense Case or Cross Examination\nUnless and until the prosecution has established its prima facie case, the defendant \"is not called upon to determine whether to produce documents and material normally privileged.

Moreover, the decision to prosecute someone criminally carries with it certain consequences:\nUnder our constitutional system, a criminal defendant—need not do anything at all to defend himself, and certainly he cannot be required to help convict himself.
