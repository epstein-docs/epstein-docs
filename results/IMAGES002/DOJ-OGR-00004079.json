Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of defense counsel's preservation letter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to view or receive copies of those materials as a matter of law, they should be provided. To the extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that application is denied.\n\nThe Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the opportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all relevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates in BOP custody. The isolated incident that took place on April 24, 2021, and the serious allegations leveled by MDC legal counsel and defense counsel in no way undermine the Court's conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers are fully able to prepare for trial. The Court is confident that all parties recognize the importance of this going forward and in advance of the upcoming trial.\n\nIn furtherance of this, counsel for the Government are ORDERED to confer with legal counsel for MDC to ensure that Ms. Maxwell continues to have access to confidential attorney-client communications as she prepares for trial. If any additional incidents arise, defense counsel shall promptly confer with counsel for the Government regarding those incidents and seek to resolve any such issues swiftly, responsibly, reasonably, and amicably. If that fails, the parties may write to the Court jointly indicating their views, identifying and justifying any specific application being made.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00004079",
