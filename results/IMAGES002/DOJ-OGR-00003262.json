Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are Postponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaña's Efforts to Obtain the Computer Evidence\nOn August 8, 2007, Villafaña informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterbaan, who was willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after August 21, he was willing to participate by phone in order \"to stay firm on our August 17th deadline.\" Villafaña also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein's assistants in New York and to interview some of Epstein's colleagues and former employees there. Noting that \"there was some concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a plea,\" Villafaña asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that the USAO \"stick to our deadline if possible.\" Lourie pointed out that CEOS \"has no approval authority\" and opined it was \"a bit extreme to allow the defense to keep arguing this [case] to different agencies.\" Acosta replied, \"This will end up [at the Department] anyhow, if we don't meet with them.

Villafaña was reluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl who began seeing Epstein at age 14 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant. On August 13, 2007, Villafaña advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of the litigation.
