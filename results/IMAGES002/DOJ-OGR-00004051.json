  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 254 Filed 04/29/21 Page 2 of 2\n\nOn Saturday, April 24, 2021, Ms. Maxwell had a scheduled legal visit with her legal counsel. During legal visits, attorneys may refer to and hand legal documents to their clients, so long as the documents are returned to the attorneys' possession at the conclusion of the visit. During Ms. Maxwell's legal visit, staff noted that she was in receipt of documents that were handed to her by the attorneys. Upon completion of the legal visit, the Visiting Room Officer notified the supervisor that Ms. Maxwell was in receipt of documents that were handed to her by her attorneys. Pursuant to Institutional Supplement BRO-5267.09A, Inmate Visiting Correctional Services, the supervisory staff were notified and identified the documents that staff referred to. Ms. Maxwell was returned to her housing unit and Legal staff were notified.\n\nI informed the supervisor to place the documents in an envelope, date and secure the envelope. I advised the supervisor to return the envelope to Ms. Maxwell's attorneys on Sunday, April 25, 2021, when they returned for another legal visit with Ms. Maxwell, and to tell the attorneys to place in the envelope and any future documents for Ms. Maxwell in one of the legal depository boxes in the lobby of the East and West buildings of MDC Brooklyn.\n\nIn addition, staff acted appropriate when Ms. Maxwell was escorted to the restroom. Pursuant to MDC Brooklyn policy, Institutional Supplement BRO-5267.09A, Inmate Visiting Correctional Services, inmates who use the Visiting Room restroom are escorted by staff and remain under staff's constant supervision.\n\nWe respectfully request Your Honor deny defense counsel's proposed order. Please let us know if the Court requires any additional information, which we will be happy to provide.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n/s/ Sophia Papapetru\n\nSophia Papapetru\nStaff Attorney\nMDC Brooklyn\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n\nPage 2 of 2\nDOJ-OGR-00004051",
