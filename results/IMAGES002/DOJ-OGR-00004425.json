As soon became apparent, Acosta was unable to achieve an expedited review so that Epstein could plead guilty and be sentenced by January 4, 2008, and the plea and sentencing date was rescheduled. On January 2, 2008, Sloman spoke with Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek, who confirmed that the change of plea hearing had been postponed.

January 7, 2008: Acosta and Sloman Meet with Sanchez, Who Makes Additional Allegations of USAO Misconduct\n\nOn January 7, 2008, Acosta and Sloman met with defense attorney Sanchez at her request. According to meeting notes made by Sloman, among other things, Sanchez alleged that the USAO's media spokesperson had improperly disclosed details of the Epstein case to a national news reporter, and Sanchez \"suggested that the USAO could avoid any potential ugliness in DC by agreeing to a watered-down resolution for Epstein.\" After Acosta excused himself to attend another meeting and Sloman refused to speak further with Sanchez \"without a witness present,\" she left. Later that day, Acosta and Sloman spoke by phone with Starr, Lefkowitz, and Sanchez, who expressed concern about the \"leak\" to the news media, reiterated their objections to the NPA, and pressed for the \"watered-down resolution,\" which they specified would mean allowing Epstein to plead to a charge of coercion instead of procurement, avoid serving time in jail, and not register as a sexual offender. A note in the margin of Sloman's handwritten notes of the conversation reads: \"We're back to where we started in September.\"\n\nThat evening, Villafaña expressed concern that the delay in resolving the matter was affecting the USAO's ability to go forward with a prosecution should Epstein renege on his agreement, and she outlined for Acosta and Sloman the steps she proposed to take while Epstein was pursuing Departmental review. Those steps included re-establishing contact with victims, interviewing victims in New York and one victim who lived in a foreign country, making contact with \"potential sources of information\" in the Virgin Islands, and re-initiating proceedings to obtain Epstein's computers.\n\nIn the meantime, USAO Criminal Division Chief Robert Senior performed a \"soup to nuts\" review of the Epstein investigation, reviewing the indictment package and all of the evidence Villafaña had compiled.
