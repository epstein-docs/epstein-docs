The defendants are cautioned, however, that evidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will not be admitted.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence - unrelated to the charged conspiracy - of the defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of \"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to prevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated without the knowledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to direct evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knowledge of the objectives likewise did not exist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will the defense even know, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be offered. As with the Court in Rivera, this Court should defer ruling on the admissibility of any such evidence until the time it is offered into evidence by the defense.\n\n53\nDOJ-OGR-00005516",
