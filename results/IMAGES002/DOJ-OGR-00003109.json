And, of course, in a severed trial exclusively on the perjury counts, the defendant would surely argue that a limiting instruction is necessary to prevent the jury from concluding that the defendant's statements were false based in part on the substance of Giuffre's unproven allegations. Just as a jury would set aside the substance of Giuffre's allegations for that purpose, so can the jury set aside the substance of Giuffre's allegations for Counts One through Four.\n\nThe defendant contends instead that the perjury counts require a \"collateral trial\" on the truth of Giuffre's statements and resolution of \"more than 50 substantive motions . . . pending before the District Court.\" (Def. Mot. 5 at 9-10).
