These included: (1) pleading guilty in Florida state court to one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, (2) registering as a federal sex offender, (3) paying for an attorney to represent his victims to sue him for personal injuries, and (4) waiving his right to contest any damages awarded in those lawsuits up to an agreed-upon amount.
