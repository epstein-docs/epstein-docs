POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the difficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous issues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the parties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of the attorney representative for the victims.

September - October 2007: Sloman's Concerns about Selection of an Attorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an attorney representative for the victims. Initially, Villafaña reached out to a private attorney who was one of several suggested to her for that role. Villafaña notified Lefkowitz that she was recommending the attorney to serve as the victims' representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the USAO could disclose to the attorney about the case. Villafaña told Lefkowitz that she had never met the attorney, but he had been recommended by \"a good friend in our appellate section\" and by one of the district judges in Miami.134 Over the next few days, Villafaña exchanged messages with the attorney about the possibility of his serving as the attorney representative. She also exchanged emails with Lefkowitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the attorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department's Criminal Division. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to the office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the provision authorizing the USAO to select an attorney representative for the victims, which he believed might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special master make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman's belated proposal, Villafaña conveyed to Lefkowitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the attorney representative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.135 She provided Lefkowitz with\n\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the understanding that he will do prison time.\" Dan Mangan, \"'Unhappy Ending' Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,\" New York Post, Oct. 1, 2007.
