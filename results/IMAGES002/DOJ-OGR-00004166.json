See Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1216 (\"The violation here is particularly insidious because it is difficult to uncover misrepresentations in an [ex parte submission]. The information needed to prove such assertions false is peculiarly within the hands of the government.\") Since Maxwell was not at the February 29 meeting or copied on any of the emails or communications that followed, the Response does not explain how Maxwell could possibly submit an affidavit attesting to the government's misrepresentations based on personal knowledge.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-00004166",
