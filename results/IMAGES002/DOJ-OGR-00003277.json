[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will mail everything down, we just want to get a final blessing.\"\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September 19, 2007, with Villafaña and Lefkowitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the scheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement's terms. During that exchange, Villafaña made clear to Lefkowitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by Monday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this has dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall apart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the negotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page indictment sitting on the shelf since May to engage in these negotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is Monday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week's negotiations from his new post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafaña to furnish him with the last draft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the \"18/12 split\" draft she had sent to Lefkowitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told Villafaña it was a \"[g]ood job\" but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the USAO's agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be in the plea agreement. Villafaña told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the \"insistence\" of the defense, and opined, \"I don't think it hurts us.\" Villafaña explained to OPR that she held this view because \"Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was resolved we weren't going to get the computer equipment.\"\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkowitz emailed a \"redline\" version of the federal plea agreement showing his new revisions, and noted that he was \"also working on a deferred [sic] prosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.\" The defense redline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor counts of attempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state indictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of coercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.04 (without regard to age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein would serve an 18-month sentence and a concurrent 60 months on probation on the state charges. The redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and replaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It retained language proposed by Villafaña, providing that the plea agreement \"resolves the federal criminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any criminal conduct by those persons known to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,\" but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein's assistants and the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration proceedings. It also included a provision stating the government's agreement to forgo a presentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and withdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\n\nDOJ-OGR-00003277",
