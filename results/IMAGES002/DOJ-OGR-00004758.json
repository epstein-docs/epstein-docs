Its treatment of its prisoners, the inmates, in the last 14 months have been nothing short, in my opinion, of inhumane, cruel and harsh and unreasonably unjust. If there's -- if I can say, unreasonably unjust. She has suffered immensely. She can tell you more about that, and Ms. Days is one of the few clients of mine that can articulate very well what she's experienced and what's going on in there. I firmly agree with Judge Oetken when he ruled just recently in U.S. v. Gonzalez, that we should be providing some extra time for anybody who spent time in MCC or MDC during this lockdown.

It's just been, again, nothing short of inhumane, in my opinion. And to bring that SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00004758",
