First, it claims that even though the offenses in the Superseding Indictment (\"Indictment\") are alleged to have occurred in Manhattan (to the extent they occurred in the Southern District at all), and even though the case has been assigned to and will be tried in this Court, the appropriate comparison population for purposes of the second Duren prong is the eligible juror population of the White Plains Counties, rather than that of either the Manhattan Counties or the Southern District as a whole. Second, the government argues that Ms. Maxwell has not satisfied the third Duren prong because any underrepresentation was not the result of systematic exclusion, even though the underrepresentation is attributable solely to the government's decision to indict Ms. Maxwell using a White Plains grand jury. Both arguments fail.\n\nI.
