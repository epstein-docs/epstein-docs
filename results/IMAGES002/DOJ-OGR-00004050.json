Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York 40 Foley Square New York, NY 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: I am writing in response to your April 26, 2021, Order seeking information regarding an alleged incident involving Ghislaine Maxwell, Register No. 02879-509, at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York (MDC Brooklyn) as relayed by her counsel in an April 26, 2021, letter. Pursuant to MDC Brooklyn policy, Institutional Supplement BRO-5267.09A, Inmate Visiting Correctional Services, inmates may carry legal materials to the visiting area which pertain to their current case. Visiting Room Officers inspect the legal materials for contraband. Inmates are not permitted to carry out any items other than those they were allowed to be take into the Visiting Room. Visiting Room Officers monitor inmate visits and if they become aware of any articles passed between the inmate and the visitors, or \"if there is any reasonable basis to suspect materials are being passed between inmates and visitors, the Visiting Room Officer may examine the item(s).\" Legal staff is responsible for assigning inmates and their attorneys to particular room. However, this is subject to change by the Visiting Room Officer, who is ultimately responsible for room and seating assignments. MDC Brooklyn sets forth these rules in Admissions and Orientation Handbook, which is given to each inmate upon admission to the institution.
