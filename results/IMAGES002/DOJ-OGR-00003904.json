Resp. 141. \"Similar character,\" for purposes of F.R.E. 8(a) \"means nearly corresponding, resembling in many respects or having a general likeness.\" United States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922 (2d Cir. 1980).

The Perjury Charges Do Not \"Concern\" the Mann Act Offenses.\n\nNor do the Perjury Counts \"concern\" the Mann Act Counts as claimed by the government. Resp. 143. The government cites the supposedly \"settled law in this Circuit that joinder of 'underlying substantive crimes with perjury counts' is appropriate 'where . . . the false declarations concern the substantive offenses.'\" Id. (citing United States v. Potamitis, 739 F.2d 784, 791 (2d Cir. 1984)). But it is wrong on both the facts and the law.\n\nThe cases cited by the government involve a distinct fact pattern: the defendant allegedly made a materially false statement that relates directly to the underlying crime and the crime is temporally related to the false statement. The Potamitis case that the government relies upon primarily for this proposition is a good example. In that case, the defendant was charged with making false statements to FBI agents, committing perjury before the grand jury, and obstruction of justice because he lied to the FBI agents and the Grand Jury about the underlying crimes for which he was being investigated and questioned.
