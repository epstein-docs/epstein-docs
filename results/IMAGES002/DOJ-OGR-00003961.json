Mollo Building One Saint Andrew's Plaza New York, New York 10007 April 23, 2021 BY ECF The Honorable Alison J. Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's Order dated April 21, 2021, which directed the Government to submit any requests for redaction of information contained in filings regarding the defense's proposed Rule 17(c) subpoena. (Dkt. No. 226). After reviewing the relevant filings, the Government seeks a limited number of redactions, which are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of third parties. In particular, the Government respectfully requests that the Court permit the redaction of the names and identifying information of particular third parties referenced in the defense's response to the objections of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (\"BSF\") to the defense's proposed Rule 17(c) subpoena, BSF's reply, and the April 19, 2021 joint letter addressing the redactions to those same documents. Today the Government is submitting to the Court by email its proposed redactions to those documents, which the Government respectfully requests be filed under seal. These proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although these documents are judicial documents that are subject to the common law presumption of access, the DOJ-OGR-00003961",
