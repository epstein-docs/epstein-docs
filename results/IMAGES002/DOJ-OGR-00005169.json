PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\n\nThe Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that has been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\n\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the Program. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This Protocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and representatives of the Estate.\n\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknowledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and offer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\n\nThe Program is governed by the following non-exclusive guiding principles:\n\n- The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have unless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.\n\n- The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or overseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submitted to the Program. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to determine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim. Decisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to review or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\n\n- There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to compensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the Administrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.\n\n1 | Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-00005169",
