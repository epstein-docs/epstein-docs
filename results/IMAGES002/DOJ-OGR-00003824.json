Tell me if I have\n7 failed in my effort to do so. Yes, ma'am.\n8 MS.

MENNINGER: The problem is, we have asked through\n15 interrogatory what were the names of the medical providers\n16 because they have not disclosed who her medical providers were.\n17 So there is no way for us to tell whether the records in fact\n18 have been sought from and produced with respect to each of\n19 those medical providers. I will say that other records in the\n20 possession of plaintiff lists other doctors who they have not\n21 asked for records from or releases.\n22 THE COURT: Let's see if we can clear that up.\n23 MS.
