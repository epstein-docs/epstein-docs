Inappropriate touching of the child (e.g., excessive tickling, hugging, wrestling, sitting on lap).\n5. Bribes for inappropriate contact (e.g., bribes for nonsexual or sexual touching or bribes to meet the adult secretly).\n6. Threats related to not participating in inappropriate contact.\n7. Inappropriate isolation of the child (e.g., trips where the offender and victim are alone that are not part of the normal adult-child relationship. It is permissible for a father to drive a child to school), or inappropriately discouraging the child to play with friends or be with family. For parents or other caretakers, the threshold for what is considered inappropriate behavior is higher than for other adults.\n8. Favoritism directed toward the child (e.g., the child is treated much better than siblings or classmates, particularly when this is intimate or isolating).\n9. Boundary violations such as inappropriately bathing the child, clothing the child, sleeping with the child, the adult being in underwear around the child, the adult acting like a child, or the adult sharing private information with the child, particularly sexual or relationship information (e.g., \"my wife and I are not having sex\"). Again, for parents, family members or caregivers the threshold is much higher for defining a boundary violation than for others.\n10. Asking the child to keep secrets, particularly about their contact (e.g., the mother's Christmas present would not be regarded as a problematic secret, whereas asking the child to not tell that she was with the offender would be).\n11. Providing the child drugs or alcohol (note: although this behavior is already abusive, it is not sexually abusive; thus, it can be considered a grooming behavior as it is inappropriate and serves to facilitate compliance with the intended sexual abuse).\n12. Misstating moral standards regarding touching, contact, or sex, particularly when these relate to adult-child sexual contact or sexualizing a situation.\n13. Repeated violations of the child's privacy (e.g., walking into bathroom when child is in there, watching her get dressed, etc.).\nThe more of these features present, the more likely the individual's behavior represents grooming. To further clarify the grooming definition, it may be helpful to also look at a few specific exemplars of nongrooming behaviors that may be misinterpreted:\n1. Purchasing appropriate gifts for the child (e.g., for birthdays).\n2. Engaging in appropriate hand-holding (e.g., to cross the street).\n3. Bathing a young child by a legitimate caregiver without any inappropriate touching.\nDOJ-OGR-00005882",
