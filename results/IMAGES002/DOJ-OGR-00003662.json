Thus, it is not anomalous at all that Congress would \"exempt[] all past offenders\" from the new limitations period, as the government asserts (Opp. 31); to the contrary, the law presumes that past conduct is exempt from legislation.

Cases applying the 2003 Amendment retroactively are readily distinguishable.\n\nWhile the government cites several cases that have applied the 2003 Amendment retroactively (Opp. 26-27), most of those cases analyzed the issue under the Ex Post Facto Clause and gave little, if any, consideration to congressional intent regarding retroactivity (as opposed to the intent of the amendment itself). In all but one of those cases, no Landgraf analysis was performed, and it does not appear that Congress' explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision was considered or even raised.3 But the government does not dispute that Landgraf is the appropriate framework—nor can it, given the Second Circuit's acknowledgment that the retroactivity of the 2003 Amendment must be analyzed under Landgraf.
