Epstein apparently had dozens of victims, and it's not clear if/when his criminal conduct stopped. The facts are complicated, there are several related civil cases, and Epstein entered into a non-pros with the SDFL USAO in 2007 that is limited but obviously something to take into account.\n\nAll that said, there are aspects of the facts here that are intriguing and I'd like to talk it over with you. I'm free next week Tuesday afternoon and all day Wednesday. Do you have time to meet then?\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Attorney's Office\nSouthern District of New York\n\n\n\nSDNY_GM_02742759\nDOJ-OGR-00004192",
