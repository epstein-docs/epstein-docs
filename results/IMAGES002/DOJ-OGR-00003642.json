While the issues raised by Mr. Martin are valid, he never actually measures their impact to determine if they meaningfully impact the demographics of the qualified jury wheel. If he had done so, as I actually did and report above, he would have found the issues about which he raises concerns explain relatively little of the absolute disparity in the representation of African American and Hispanic individuals between the qualified jury wheel and the community.\n\n43. Mr. Martin's declaration expends much effort in defining populations of persons in the community who are not or cannot be in the master jury wheel (i.e., reason 2 above). This is of little value. The issue is only whether and to what extent they are different, what is causing them to be different, and to what extent it causes them to be different. Thus, the issue is not whether someone is left out. For example, clearly persons in the community in 2020 who were too young to register to vote on November 2016, or persons who moved into the area after November 2016 are not on the November 1, 2016 voter registration lists. However, the issue is not who is on the current voter registration list but was not on the November 1, 2016 voter registration list. Rather, the question is what is causing the difference between the qualified jury wheel—that is based on the November 1, 2016 voter population—and the benchmark for the community—which is based on the 5-year ACS. Persons who move into White Plains are also not in the benchmark computation. If we are to update the voter registration lists to match the current community benchmarks (an impossible task) we would also need to update the community benchmark. Mr. Martin presents the difference in the wheels based on the November 2016 voter registration lists and the benchmark based on the community demographics between 2014 and 2018. The relevant question is what factors cause the difference he presents, and to what extent these factors cause the absolute disparity between the community benchmark and the\n\n22\n\nDOJ-OGR-00003642",
