Awadallah, 349 F.3d 42, 64 (2d Cir. 2003).

Canfield, 212 F.3d 713, 718 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\nTo determine whether alleged errors and omissions are material, a court should revise the affidavit (adding alleged omissions and correcting alleged errors), and determine whether the revised affidavit supports a finding of probable cause.
