He argued that the defense \"should have a right to review and make objections to that submission prior to it being sent to any alleged victims.\" He also insisted that if any notification letters were sent to \"victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein has entered his plea\" and that the letter should come from the attorney representative rather than the government.

In a November 30, 2007 reply letter to Lefkowitz, Acosta did not address the substance of Lefkowitz's arguments, but accused the defense team of \"in essence presenting collateral challenges\" delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was dissatisfied with the NPA, \"we stand ready to unwind the Agreement\" and proceed to trial. Shortly thereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by letter that he had directed prosecutors \"not to issue victim notification letters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time to review these options with your client.\" In the letter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that Villafaña had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary damages, stating that \"the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during the investigation phase of this matter.\"\n\nOn December 5, 2007, Starr and Lefkowitz sent a letter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman and Assistant Attorney General Fisher, \"reaffirm[ing]\" the NPA, but taking \"serious issue\" with\n\n312 On November 28, 2007, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafaña that only 15 of the then-known victims had received victim notification letters from either the FBI or the USAO.
