I accept and adopt as my findings the described offense and offense conduct, the calculation of the guidelines. The total offense level is 25. The defendant's criminal history category is II. I accept and adopt as my findings the description of the offender characteristics as are set forth beginning at paragraph 56 of the presentence report.\n8 I want to thank Mr. Donaldson for his eloquent memorandum. I'm not going to put all of the details on the record, but it is pretty clear to me that Ms. Days' life might have been very, very different if she had not been subjected to the abuse she was subjected to as a young teenager. I have no reason to believe that she was on that path.\n14 I have considered all of the section 3553(a) factors, and I conclude that the mandatory minimum sentence meets the parsimony goals of the statute and is sufficient to provide deterrence to this defendant and to punish her for the crimes committed.\n19 Accordingly, under docket number 19 CR 619, a total offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of II, I hereby sentence you, Tiffany Days, to the mandatory minimum term of 60 months' imprisonment, to be followed by a term of four years' supervised release. I am not imposing a fine. The defendant has no ability to pay. Restitution is not applicable.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00004768",
