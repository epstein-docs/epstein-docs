None of this is relevant.

Plaintiff seeks testimony from witness who she claims will testify to experience similar to her stories and this will Motion at 15-16. Such evidence is prohibited by FRE 404(b), which states \"Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\" Furthermore, no other witness has claimed as Plaintiff does that Ghislaine Maxwell sexually abused them, sexually trafficked them, or that she partook in daily sex with any underage girls. Plaintiff's claim stands in isolation because it is fictional.\n\n7 This \"circumstantial evidence\" has no bearing on the truthfulness of the stories published by Plaintiff. It is equally likely to show that Plaintiff became aware of the allegations of others and decided to hop on the band wagon. She then made up similar claims for the purpose of getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the media for publicizing her allegations and identifying well know public figures whose names she has seen documents that she reviewed or other stories she had read.\n\n8",
