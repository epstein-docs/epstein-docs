(Indictment ¶¶ 22-27). During that time, Minor Victim-4 personally interacted with the defendant—for instance, the defendant paid Minor Victim-4 following Minor Victim-4's sexual encounters with Epstein. (Id. 25(a)).\n\nIn 2007, Minor Victim-4 was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In that interview, she described meeting “an older lady with short black hair and an unknown accent”—a description that is consistent with the defendant's appearance—at her first meeting with Epstein. In , Minor Victim-4 was deposed, during which she explained that she sometimes called the house to get work, and she would talk to an employee or “Maxwell.” Later in the deposition, she added that the same employee or “Maxwell” would contact her when Epstein wanted her to come.\n\nThis Office first interviewed Minor Victim-4 in July 2020. During that meeting, Minor Victim-4 spoke about her many interactions with the defendant. She did so again at the Government's meetings with her in August 2020, and at multiple meetings in January 2021.\n\nThe Government met Minor Victim-4 again in June 2021 for several meetings. During one of those meetings, the Government showed Minor Victim-4 a photo book containing 20 photos. The Government asked Minor Victim-4 to review each photograph in the book and to indicate whether she recognized anyone in the book. The Government explained that just because someone is in the book, it does not mean that Minor Victim-4 knowns that person or that the person is in trouble. The Government instructed Minor Victim-4 just to let the Government know if she recognized anyone.\n\n64\n\nDOJ-OGR-00005848",
