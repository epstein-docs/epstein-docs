(United States superseding state limitation) see Miller v. United States, 2021 U.S. Dist. Lexis 17485 (Dist. of Maine, 2021) (Struggling with 3283's Preclusion language) Section 3283's \"Offense Involving\" Section 3283's \"offense involving\" language therefore applies to the repeated offenses, chapter 109A offenses, and possibly 18 use §113(a). The 109A offenses include sub-offenses, and 10 U.S.C. defines sex act and sexual contact. Section 3283 is limited to territorial and maritime jurisdictions, which is why 18 USC §3277 was enacted. This is obvious. Several court however have found that §3283 applies to any and all statutes where the offense \"conduct\" involves sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping. See United States v. Kepler, 2021 U.S. Dist. Lexis 2820 (N. Dist. of Ok., 2021) (Considering applying §3283 to assault with deadly weapon; citing United States v.
