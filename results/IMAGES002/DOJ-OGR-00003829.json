The statement from a\n5 mediator doesn't mean anything to me. Something that has a\n6 court sign to it. That I understand. But the mediator saying\n7 that it's settled doesn't work for me.\n8 MR. CASSELL: Your Honor, maybe Mr. Edwards could\n9 briefly explain Florida procedure. The case has been\n10 dismissed, but it does not require a Court's signature.\n11 Mr. Edwards can elaborate more fully on that.\n12 MR. EDWARDS: Sure. If I may. There are two ways in\n13 which a case can be dismissed in Florida. One is by way of a\n14 court order. The other is by way of a stipulation. That is\n15 what was done. There was a stipulation of dismissal signed by\n16 both parties, that being the plaintiff and the defendants and\n17 counsel, that has been done and that was dismissed.\n18 THE COURT: That's filed in the case.\n19 MR. EDWARDS: That's filed in the case and filed in\n20 the court.\n21 THE COURT: Do you have a copy of that?\n22 MR. EDWARDS: I can get a copy of it immediately.\n23 THE COURT: Give it to the defense. If they have any\n24 problems, they will let me know. That sounds all right to me.\n25 What do I know about Florida except that it's flat and hot.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00003829",
