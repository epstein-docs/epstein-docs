Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI's January 10, 2008 letter stating that the case was under investigation; however, according to the case agent, Wild and two other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2007, that the case had been resolved. In her 2015 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI letter, she believed that the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told \"about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have objected.\" In Villafaña's 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña recalled interviewing Wild on January 31, 2008, along with FBI agents, and Villafaña told OPR she \"asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.\" Villafaña recalled Wild responding that she \"hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to testify.\"335\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 31, 2008, Villafaña described for Acosta and Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview twice . . . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming after her and she started to break down again so we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . was very upset about the 18 month deal she had read about in the paper.336 She said that 18 months was nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.337\n\nVillafaña closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman attend the interviews with victims scheduled for the following day, but neither did so.338 Acosta told OPR that it \"wasn't typical\"\n\n335 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild's intentions.\n\n336 See Dareh Gregorian, \"Tycoon Perved Me at 14 - $50M Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,\" New York Post, Jan. 25, 2008.
