Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\nRe: Deadline for Filing Motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nI write to confirm that November 15, 2021 is the deadline for Ms. Maxwell to file a motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, which governs the admissibility of evidence of an alleged victim's sexual behavior.\nUnder this Court's pretrial scheduling order, motions in limine are due on October 18. A motion in limine is a \"pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or offered at trial.\" Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).\nA motion under Rule 412 is not a motion in limine. Rather, it is a motion seeking permission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive motion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, consideration, and determination. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under its terms—14 days before trial. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(1)(B) (providing that a defendant must file her motion \"at least 14 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, sets a different time\").\nDOJ-OGR-00005226",
