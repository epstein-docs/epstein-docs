If the language is ambiguous, legislative history can be helpful to determine congressional intent.

Dodge, 597 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2010).\nThis guidance was ignored entirely by the Fifth Circuit. First, the court ignored the fact that the statute of limitation was mistiled for complitly unknown reasons as the first sentence of civil stay language at 33509(6) in 1990. Several proposals targetted the limitations, Chapter (213) from the start. see Lavine H.R. 4882, may 4, 1990, Dewine No. R 3752 Feb 6, 1990.\nDOJ-OGR-00005186",
