Any defense expert that relates to the testimony of the accusers or 404(b) witnesses cannot possibly be disclosed before Ms. Maxwell has even been provided access to that testimony.\n\nTo illustrate the point, one need look only at the government's expert disclosure. The proposed testimony for the government's expert, although purportedly not based on a review of the facts of this case, nevertheless appears to have been crafted by the government with full knowledge of the accusers' specific allegations. For example, the government proffers that their expert will testify that \"minor victims . . . may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood.\" Clearly, the accusers must have represented facts to support these contentions or else there would be no grounds to admit this \"blind\" expert opinion testimony. Ms. Maxwell cannot be expected to hire experts and divine what would be relevant to this case before she is provided the statements by these accusers, whose credibility will be the central question for the jury in this case.\n\nThe Court originally ordered the defense expert disclosures four weeks before trial and\n\nDOJ-OGR-00004262",
