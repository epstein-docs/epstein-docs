We will of course not sit on federal holidays, including Christmas Eve and Christmas and New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. The questionnaire will explain the estimated schedule more fully and you will get to that in a moment.\n\nBut first, I want to tell you a little bit about the case. As I mentioned, this is a criminal case. The charges against the Defendant are set forth in an indictment. An indictment is a formal method of accusing someone of a crime. It is not evidence of any kind. It is the Government's burden at trial to establish a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis case is brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York against Ghislaine Maxwell. The indictment against Ms. Maxwell alleges that she conspired with and aided and abetted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNow, as some of you may have already figured out, there is going to be significant press coverage of this trial. Some of you may have already heard about this case in the media, and that is OK. But from this moment on, I instruct you that you are not to read or watch or listen to\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-00005319",
