STERNHEIM\nindictment\" which provided the narrative for Ms. Strauss's choreographed press conference. Ms. Strauss exceeded the text of the indictment and went off-script, as did members of law enforcement involved in the investigation whom Ms. Strauss invited to speak. Collectively, these members of the government, who were directly involved in the investigation and prosecution of this case, purposely villainized Ms. Maxwell and gave the accusers - the individuals who will testify before a jury - the imprimatur of credibility. The press conference was the government's unbridled opportunity to deliver an extrajudicial opening statement in the court of public opinion and the media has followed its lead ever since.\nSimilarly, counsel for undisclosed Accusers 1 to 4 have made numerous public statements without any reprisal or public reprimand by the government. They have participated in countless podcasts, documentaries, and other media and print publications espousing personal opinions regarding Ms. Maxwell's \"guilt or innocence\" and the \"merits of the case,\" commenting on her \"character and reputation,\" the \"possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense,\" and continually jeopardizing her right to a fair trial.2\nUndersigned counsel wrote to the government expressing concern about a particular counsel's public remarks as that counsel has (we believe) previously represented one of the accusers. The government responded that \"[t]o our knowledge, [that lawyer] does not represent any of the witnesses the Government expects to call at trial in this case. Because this individual does not represent any witnesses in this case, we do not see a need to raise this issue with the Court.\" Now, the government asserts that the Court needs to know about a lawyer who is not representing any witnesses.\n2 Ms. Maxwell previously brought to the Court's attention violations of Local Crim. R. 23.1 by David Boies, Esq. and his law partner, Sigrid McCawley, Esq., each having filed a notice of appearance as intervenors for accusers, as well as Bradley Edwards, Esq. (See Dkt. 27 at 4.) Many of their public and incendiary comments occurred after this Court \"warn[ed] counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the fact of violations of any relevant rules.\" (Dkt. 28) (July 23, 2020).\n2\nDOJ-OGR-00004953",
