Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nApril 22, 2021\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's Order dated April 20, 2021, which permitted the Government an opportunity to submit a response to the defense request for an adjournment of trial in the above-referenced case. (Dkt. No. 221). As previewed in its April 9, 2021 letter (Dkt. No. 199), the Government strenuously opposes any adjournment of the July 12, 2021 trial date in this case. Given both the recently granted severance and the Government's intention to present a streamlined case focused primarily on the experiences of four victims, trial on the non-perjury counts in indictment S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the \"S2 Indictment\") will not be materially lengthened by the addition of new charges. As previously noted, the Government has made and will continue to make significant efforts to ensure that the defense is able to prepare for trial as scheduled. Moreover, delay of the trial would prejudice the victims in this case, multiple of whom oppose any adjournment. Should the Court nevertheless grant the defense's request for an adjournment, however, the Government respectfully requests that trial be scheduled for March 2022 to ensure continuity of Government counsel at trial.\nDOJ-OGR-00003943",
