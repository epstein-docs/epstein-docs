  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 397 Filed 10/29/21 Page 26 of 84 testimony that \"sexual assault can result in severe, long-lasting and wide-ranging psychological consequences and related difficulties\"). The defendant argues that this evidence is nonetheless prejudicial because it will inflame the passions and emotions of the jury. (Def. Mot. 3 at 14). The Minor Victims, however, will be the ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or cross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether the jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—testimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal connection whose reliability the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about this expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the probative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. 4. Dr. Rocchio's Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is Admissible As noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that \"[t]he presence of other individuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.\" (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 1 at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio will explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators appear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim that sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr. Rocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence of a woman. The defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay matter \"which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert's help.\" (Def. Mot. 3 at 14 25 DOJ-OGR-00005809",
