STERNHEIM\n\nIn the face of the Epstein's death on the BOP's watch, the MDC would not risk a repeat of the debacle that occurred in the MCC. There can be no doubt that the MDC was following directives from Attorney General William Barr and the Director of the BOP in determining that Ms. Maxwell should not be placed in general population, not Ms. Maxwell. Regardless, the MDC would never risk security to Ms. Maxwell or the institution by placing her in general population, knowing the difficulties it would face in protecting Ms. Maxwell from assault and extortion by other inmates given that they do not protect her from physical abuse by guards. But that decision does not justify the degree to which the MDC overmanages Ms. Maxwell's detention and its detrimental effect on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for trial.\n\nWe have repeatedly expressed our concern for Ms. Maxwell's health and the impact her conditions of confinement are having on her health and well-being, her ability to prepare for trial, and the overall impact the severe conditions will have on her stamina to withstand trial, which we moved to the fall. With each passing day, it becomes increasingly more obvious that Ms. Maxwell's extreme conditions of detention will not be improved and health deteriorate commensurate with the unprecedented conditions of confinement unparalleled in the MDC.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBobbi C.
