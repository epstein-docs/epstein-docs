The twenty-second and twenty-third questions, however, inquired about convictions (one about \"traffic convictions,\" the other about \"other convictions\"). Manapat answered in the negative to both question twenty-two and question twenty-three, and these answers became the basis for his prosecution for \"knowingly and willfully\" making false statements to any department or agency of the United States. In affirming the district court's decision to dismiss the indictment, the Eleventh Circuit stated:\n\nAlthough the single statements \"Record of traffic convictions,\" or \"Record of other convictions\" may not be ambiguous standing alone, they become quite confusing when buried in a list headed \"Medical History\" and purportedly concerned with medical conditions....
