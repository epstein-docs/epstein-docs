[T]hey weren't acting unethically. I just disagree with the outcome . . . but the point is they weren't trying . . . to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . . you can let the victims weigh in on this and maybe it doesn't sway you. You still do what you're going to do but . . . it's hard to say it was a complete, completely clean exercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn't really know what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, \"I don't think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point in terms of notifying victims. . . .

SEPTEMBER 24, 2007 - JUNE 30, 2008: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE USAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafaña and the case agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation. However, the emails also show that the USAO was unclear about how much information could be given to the victims in light of the NPA's nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein's defense counsel regarding victim notifications.296 As a result, although the expectation in the USAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision, and the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense attorneys, who strongly objected to the government's notification plan. In addition, Villafaña and the case agents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision would damage the victims' credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In the end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Attorney's discretion whether to notify the victims about the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not provided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2008.\n\n295 Oosterbaan stated that, in retrospect, \"maybe I should have been more aggressive with how . . . I dealt with [the USAO].\"\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: \"The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process commanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.\"\n\n206\nDOJ-OGR-00004530",
