You've got to tell your probation officer within 72 hours. This is a big important one. You must not own, possess or have access to a firearm, ammunition, destructive device or any dangerous weapon. There are no excuses. And you can't act or make any agreement with law enforcement to act as a confidential informant or a human source without getting the permission of the Court. Was there an appeal waiver in the plea agreement? MR. DONALDSON: Yes, there was. MR. CHIUCHIOLO: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: So, Ms. Days, do you recall that at the time you took your plea of guilty, you also signed a letter of agreement with the government? It's dated April of last year. THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: Okay. In that letter it says that if I sentenced you to 78 months or less in prison, you wouldn't take an appeal from your sentence or file a lawsuit challenging the legality of your sentence. Do you recall that? THE DEFENDANT: Yes. THE COURT: Did Mr. Donaldson explain to you before you signed the letter that you were giving up your right to take an appeal, as long as I didn't sentence you to more than 78 months?
