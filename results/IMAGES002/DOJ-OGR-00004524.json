USAO and FBI Letters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications \"at the time that we met [with] the girls.\" The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO letters and FBI letters to some victims following in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a victim with a letter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to that set forth in the FBI letters.280 The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered \"a few\" letters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI letters to victims and she provided some FBI letters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\nNevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she \"did not sit there and go through every right\" with the victims.
