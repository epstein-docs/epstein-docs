This deadline will also allow the Government adequate time in the coming weeks to finalize its witness list for trial, review its files for all Giglio and Jencks Act materials, and prepare those materials for production. The Government is prepared to provide the defense with notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) by May 28, 2021, or 45 days in advance of trial. Consistent with the motion in limine schedule set forth above, this proposed deadline will provide the defense with adequate time to review the disclosure and file any appropriate motions. This deadline will also allow the Government adequate time to finalize its determination of what evidence it will seek to introduce at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). The Government is prepared to provide the defense with its proposed exhibit list and marked exhibits by June 11, 2021, or one month in advance of trial.
