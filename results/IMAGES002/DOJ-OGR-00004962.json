NATHAN, District Judge: The Government has moved for an order requiring David Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1 following an op-ed that he authored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 309. Mr. Markus is plainly a lawyer associated with the defense in this case. His formal representation has involved handling at least one pre-trial issue for Ms. Maxwell—in particular, appeals to the Second Circuit of this Court's bail-denial determinations. Dkt. No. 173; see also United States v. Maxwell, Nos. 21-58-cr(L), 21-770-cr (2d Cir.). Beyond that, he has held himself out as Ms. Maxwell's attorney in press related to the current trial stage, including in the op-ed at issue in the Government's letter application, which describes him as “Maxwell's appellate counsel.” He has also attended a proceeding in this matter and spoken on Ms. Maxwell's behalf to the press afterwards while identified as Ms. Maxwell's attorney.
