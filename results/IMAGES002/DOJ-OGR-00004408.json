Shortly after midnight on Monday, September 24, 2007, Acosta sent Villafaña \"[s]mall edits\" to the \"final\" NPA she had sent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the State Attorney's Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, \"I'm not comfortable with requiring the State Attorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation\" or \"requiring a State court to stick with our timeline\" for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly, Acosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing recommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his \"best efforts\" to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafaña to restore a reference to Epstein's wish \"to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.\" Lourie, who had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with Lefkowitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafaña.
