H at 9). \"That knowledge,\" the Court explained, \"goes directly to the truth or falsity of the alleged defamation, a key element of Plaintiff's claim.\" (Id.). The Court therefore ordered the defendant to answer the questions related to her sexual activity with or involving (1) Epstein, (2) Giuffre, (3) underage girls known to Epstein or who she thought might become known to Epstein, or (4) involving massage with individuals the defendant \"knew to be, or believed might be, known to Epstein.\" (Id. at 10). The Court further ordered the defendant to answer questions about her knowledge of the sexual activities of others in the same four categories. The Court added that the \"scope of Defendant's answers are not bound by time period, though Defendant need not answer questions that relate to none of these subjects or that is clearly not relevant.\" (Id.). The defendant sat for a second deposition on July 22, 2016, before the case settled.\n\nAs discussed more fully below, the Indictment charges the defendant with two counts of perjury, one arising from statements made during the April 2016 deposition and one arising from statements made during the July 2016 deposition.
