Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated letter, the letter requested the victims' \"assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.\"\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafaña also drafted a notification letter concerning the June 30, 2008 plea and the 18 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were to be hand delivered along with the FBI's letters.
