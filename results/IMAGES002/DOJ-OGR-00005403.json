Mot. at 1, Kelly, No. 19 Cr. 286 (E.D.N.Y. July 10, 2021), Dkt. No. 121.

The Government also explained that two of the victims had \"not spoken publicly about their experiences,\" and while a third had done so, \"her anticipated testimony at trial will be more fulsome than her prior public disclosures and will include sensitive information that has not been previously publicly revealed.\" Id. at 11.
