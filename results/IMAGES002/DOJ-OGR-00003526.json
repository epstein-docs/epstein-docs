  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE    Document 204-4    Filed 04/16/21    Page 2 of 6\n\n- LP directed AK to \"they will send me affidavits and depositions\" on page 8 of AK's notes and asked if AK recalls what that line refers to and whether the attorneys sent AK any such materials.\n  - AK does not recall what that line refers to.\n  - AK does not recall if the attorneys sent her any such materials after the meeting.\n  - AK does not believe the attorneys provided her any materials during the meeting.\n  - AK has a vague memory that the attorneys sent her something by email, but does not recall what it was.\n    - One of the emails LP sent to AK was an email from Skinner to AK the evening of February 29, 2016 after the meeting sending AK documents. AK does not remember the particular documents she received. AK does not recall receiving any additional documents.\n- AK remembers the mention of several people, including Ghislaine Maxwell as either in the context of who had benefited from the Florida NPA or who the people were that had worked for or helped Epstein. AK doesn't recall much specifics about Maxwell. Maxwell was not a focus of the meeting.\n- AK does not recall the attorneys saying anything about what charges the office could bring. Related to that, AK recalls asking questions to understand what kind of charges they were proposing because it was not clear. The attorneys did not present particular statutes that might be pursued.\n- AK recalls trying to understand what prior statements of Virginia Roberts existed in the context of assessing how much of a record there already was. AK recalls that the information about civil lawsuits came up when AK asked the attorneys what record there was of Roberts's statements about Epstein, either in the context of the Florida case or otherwise.\n  - AK's notes don't jog AK's memory of what she learned about Virginia Roberts's prior statements.\n  - AK does remember that there was some civil litigation, including CVRA litigation and some other civil case, and not just involving Virginia, but also civil litigation involving other potential witness or witnesses. AK's takeaway was that there was a large and potentially complicated record of civil litigation that would have to be at some point parsed through in assessing what any potential witness had said. It wasn't only that there was civil litigation involving Virginia, but there was also some person in Europe involved in litigation. AK felt this was a situation where there would be a lot of material to gather and read before talking to witnesses.\n- AK doesn't remember being told any specific allegations victims had made against Maxwell. AK generally remembers Maxwell being mentioned as someone who had worked for Epstein.\n  - Notes reflect that Maxwell was \"head recruiter,\" but AK does not recall that description being attributed to any particular witness\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-00003526",
