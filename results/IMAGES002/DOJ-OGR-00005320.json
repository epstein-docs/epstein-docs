You are not to discuss this case among yourselves, you are not to discuss it with anyone, including your family, friends, anyone. You may say that you are part of the jury selection process in a criminal case in federal court, but that is all you may say. Moreover, you are not to do any research through any means about the case or anyone involved in it. That includes the defendant, it includes the judge, it includes the lawyers, and it includes any other names you hear about today.\nAnd it means, among other things, that you are not to chatter about it on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tiktok, Snapchat, or any other social media services. You are not to read anything about it online or in the paper. You are not to watch or listen to anything about it on television, the radio, or on podcasts. You are not to do a Google search or any other kind of search. You may not do any of that and that is very important. As I am sure you understand, we must ensure that we have a jury of citizens who will decide the issues in this case based only on the evidence that is presented in court during the trial.\nBecause this is a high-profile case AND because we are still in the age of COVID, I want to assure you that the Court will take a number of steps to protect your privacy and safety. First, when you are filling out the questionnaire and as we go through the later stages of the process, I ask that you please not identify yourself by your name or identify anyone you are associated with by name. Throughout the selection process and if you are selected as a juror, although the lawyers and I will know your names, we will only refer to you in Court by your juror number. This will protect your privacy.\nSecond, due to COVID and to ensure easy access into and out of the Courthouse, the Court will arrange and provide transportation for selected jurors to and from the Courthouse every day of trial.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-00005320",
