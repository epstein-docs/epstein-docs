Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nMay 6, 2021\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully submits this letter to supplement its letter of May 4, 2021 (Dkt. No. 269) regarding Requests 9 through 11 of the defendant's requested subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP.\nAs noted in the Government's letter, the Government has produced to the defense copies of the photographs sought in Request 11. (Dkt. No. 269 at 8). The Government has now determined that, for a subset of the photographs requested by the defendant, the Government previously provided the defense with scanned images of this subset of photographs from the FBI Florida file. The original photographs are currently in the FBI's possession. Accordingly, because some of the original photographs are currently in the Prosecution Team's possession, the Government will make them available to the defendant for inspection upon request. Request 11 is therefore moot as to those photographs.\nDOJ-OGR-00004105",
