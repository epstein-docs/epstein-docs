Stat. 800.04(4);\n(b) solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, in violation of Fl. Stat. 796.03; and\n(c) engaging in sexual activity with minors at least sixteen years of age, in violation of Fl. Stat. 794.05.\n\nEpstein and the State Attorney's Office make a joint, binding recommendation that Epstein serve at least two years in prison, without any opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing; and without probation or community control in lieu of imprisonment.\n\nEpstein agrees to waive all challenges to the information filed by the State and the right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agrees that, if any of the victims identified in the federal investigation file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 2255, Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida over his person and the subject matter.

The contemporaneous emails show that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered multiple counter-proposals to the USAO's stated terms, and alternated between working out the state plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement. The emails make clear that as the negotiations intensified in September 2007, the prosecutors became increasingly frustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and provisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.
