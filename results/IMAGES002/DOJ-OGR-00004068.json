THE COURT: Have you had time to review it with your attorney? THE DEFENDANT: I have, your Honor. THE COURT: You have a right to have the indictment read to you here in open court or you can waive the public reading. Do you waive the public reading? THE DEFENDANT: I waive the public reading. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, how does your client wish to plead? MS. STERNHEIM: She enters a plea of not guilty. THE COURT: Thank you. With that I note that we do have a number of scheduling issues pending. I have received the parties' briefing on the defense's request for a continuance of the trial date until either the fall or winter. I'm considering that request and gathering information. I will provide resolution as soon as I can, and I believe it is important to do so quickly. As I've stated, however, unless and until you hear further from me, you must assume that I will request a jury selection date as close to the planned July 12 date as possible. I have also received the parties' proposed schedules SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00004068",
