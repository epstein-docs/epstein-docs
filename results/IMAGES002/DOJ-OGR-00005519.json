If the topic of \"charitable works\" comes up in the government's case, then topics of Ms. Maxwell's \"charitable works\" may become relevant.

One wonders if the government is suggesting these topics because it intends to try to elicit some testimony on these topics and then preclude Ms. Maxwell from responding. If that were the case, then the government should have said so in their Motion. Regardless, there is no reason for the Court to enter any orders on this topic.
