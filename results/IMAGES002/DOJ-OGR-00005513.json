The Government Cites No Authority for Requiring Pre-trial Notice of Such Evidence.\n\nAt the outset, this Court can deny the government's motion for a simple reason: There is no authority requiring Ms. Maxwell to provide the government with notice of the evidence she intends to offer at trial. To the contrary, when such notice is required, the Rules of Evidence or Procedure make the requirement express. Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(b), for example, imposes a duty on Ms. Maxwell to make certain disclosures, particularly as they regard expert witnesses and opinions. But the Rule does not require her to identify evidence of her \"absence when Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government's case-in-chief' and then \"explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be admissible.\"\n\nNor does Rule of Evidence 404(b) require notice from the defendant. In fact, the government's invocation of Rule 404(b) actually undermines its motion. In a criminal case, that Rule imposes on the government a duty to provide advance notice of any other-acts evidence it desires to admit at trial. Fed. R.
