Is there any expectation\n9 that these materials would be used to commence criminal proceedings against either of the parties to the libel case?\n10\n11 MR. ROSSMILLER: I can say that just as a general matter, that any materials that we gather in any part of any\n12 investigation that appear to give rise to criminal liability for individuals implicated in those materials could cause us to\n13 proceed with an investigation of any such individual. That's a little broad, your Honor, obviously, but --\n14\n15 THE COURT: Oh, no. I understand what you're saying.\n16 And I think Judge Sweet had some concerns about that.\n17\n18 MR. ROSSMILLER: But I don't think that there's any additional protection for the parties of the lawsuit as opposed\n19 to nonparties' information.\n20\n21 THE COURT: They're the ones who relied on the protective order.
