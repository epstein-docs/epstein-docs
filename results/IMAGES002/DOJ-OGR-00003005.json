Sprouts, 282 F.3d\n1037, 1041 (8th Cir. 2002)).\nThe vast majority of pre-indictment delay cases fail on the first prong. See, e.g., Marion,\n404 U.S. at 324-25 (fading witness memories insufficient; \"no one suggests that every delay-\ncaused detriment to a defendant's case should abort a criminal prosecution\"); United States v.\nSnyder, 668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. 1982) (death of a defense witness three years before indictment\ninsufficient prejudice); United States v. Iannelli, 461 F.2d 483, 485 (2d Cir. 1972) (unavailability\nof witnesses insufficient prejudice); United States v. King, 560 F.2d 122, 130-31 (2d Cir. 1977)\n(death of witness and missing documents insufficient prejudice); Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043140,\nat *4-5 (death of a defense witness and defendant's own memory issues insufficient prejudice).\n2. Discussion\nThe defendant points to at least four ways in which she claims the passage of time\nprejudiced her defense, but none of her hypothetical claims of prejudice withstand scrutiny. In\nparticular, she contends that, as a result of the passage of time, four witnesses have died, unnamed\nEpstein employees have been \"lost,\" unspecified witnesses now have \"failed or corrupted\"\nmemoires, and records have been lost or destroyed. She further contends that these collectively\ndemonstrate actual prejudice. (Def. Mot. 7 at 8-14). None has merit, individually or collectively.\nWith respect to the first three arguments, the fact that certain witnesses cannot testify\nbecause of their deaths or failed memories does not compel a finding of actual prejudice. \"Faded\nmemories or unavailable witnesses are inherent in any delay, even if justifiable. To merit dismissal\na defendant must demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself.\"\n44\nDOJ-OGR-00003005",
