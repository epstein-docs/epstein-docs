The Court will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See Transcript at 10-11. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrowly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at 12.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November 19 or November 29.\nThe Court implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID-19 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings.\nAlso for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-00005275",
