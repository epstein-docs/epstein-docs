Like anyone accused of a crime in this country, Ms. Maxwell is, and must be, presumed innocent of any and all charges made against her unless and until the government proves her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Indictment is only an accusation and is not proof or evidence of anything.\nThe government and only the government has the burden of proving each of the essential elements of each crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The purpose of the trial is to determine whether the government has met this burden.\nA defendant in a criminal trial never has to prove innocence. Every defendant is presumed innocent of the charges in an indictment, unless and until during your deliberations you determine that the government has met its burden of proof.\nFour rules apply in every criminal case that you must keep in mind.\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00005359",
