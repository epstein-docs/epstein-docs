In connection with this matter, I have received and reviewed the presentence sentence investigation report prepared by United States Probation Officer Sandra Vella Garcia. It was filed with the Court on October 15, 2020. I have a letter on the stationery of the United States Attorney's Office dated March 27, 2020. That looks to me like the plea agreement. So I have a copy of the plea agreement. I have a memo dated April 22nd, 2021, on the stationery of the United States Attorney's Office, which is in the nature of a sentencing memorandum from the government. I have a sentencing memorandum filed on April 21st, 2021 from Mr. Donaldson. Aside from the waiver, which we'll talk about in one minute, is there anything else I should have seen in writing prior to today's proceeding? I should note that Mr. Donaldson's memorandum has, I believe, some attachments to it. No, it doesn't. It does not. That's the other one. Okay. Is there anything else I should have seen in writing prior to today's proceeding from the government? MR. CHIUCHIOLO: Not from the government, your Honor. THE COURT: From the defense? MR. DONALDSON: No, I don't believe so, your Honor. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00004750",
