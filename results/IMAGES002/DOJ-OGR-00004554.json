It is also my practice not to talk about status before the grand jury.\n\nIn her 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña explained that during these exchanges, Villafaña did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she \"did not know whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court guilty plea that would trigger the NPA.\"350 Villafaña told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\n\nalso had interactions with other victims' attorneys. For example, another attorney informed OPR that he spoke to Villafaña two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under investigation. The attorney noted, \"[W]e never got any information out of [Villafaña]. We were never told what was happening or going on to any extent.\" Villafaña's counsel told OPR that Villafaña did not have any interaction with the attorney or his law partner until after Epstein's state court plea hearing, and that in her written communications responding to the attorney's inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation that Villafaña's communications with the attorney occurred prior to June 30, 2008. Villafaña also had more ministerial interactions with other victims' counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March 2008, one victim's attorney informed Villafaña of his representation of a victim and requested that the government provide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein's airplane. Villafaña responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep her updated about the civil litigation.\n348 Villafaña later stated in a July 9, 2008 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited Edwards to provide her with information, \"[n]othing was provided.\"\n349 Edwards did not respond to OPR's request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other attorneys who were representing victims.\n350 The government later admitted in court filings that Villafaña and Edwards \"discussed the possibility of federal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.\" Doe, Government's Response to Petitioners' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at 14, ¶101 (June 6, 2017).\n\n230\n\nDOJ-OGR-00004554",
