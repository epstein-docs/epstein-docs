Thus, \"[i]n the absence of a specific showing that disclosure [of a witness list] [is] both material to the preparation of [the] defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding [the] case,' the request for a witness list should be denied.\" United States v. Russo, 483 F. Supp. 2d 301, 309 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Bejasa, 904 F.2d at 139-40). \"Courts in the Second Circuit typically deny motions for the early disclosure of witness lists where, as here, Defendants have not made a specific showing of need.\" United States v. Rivera, No. 16 Cr. 175 (LGS), 2017 WL 1843302, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2017). The claim that \"given the complexity of the case, disclosure of the government witness list will level the playing field\" amounts to an \"abstract statement of need\" that does not justify provision of a witness list.

Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 145 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"[T]he Jencks Act prohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial disclosure of witness statements.\"); United States v.
