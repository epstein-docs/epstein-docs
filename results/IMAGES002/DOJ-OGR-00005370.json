At the conclusion of the case, your job will be to determine whether or not the defendant is guilty as charged in the Indictment. Does any juror have any difficulty with that principle, or any problem in accepting and following the instructions of the law that I will give you in this case? 49. Will each juror accept the proposition that the question of punishment is for the Court alone to decide, and that the possible punishment must not enter into the deliberation of the jurors as to whether the defendant on trial here is guilty or not guilty? 50. Will each of you accept the proposition that sympathy or empathy must not enter into the deliberations of the jurors as to whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty, and that only the evidence presented here in Court may be used by you to determine whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the crimes charged? 51. It is not a particularly pleasant duty to find another individual guilty of committing a crime. Is there any juror who feels that even if the evidence established a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he or she might not be able to render a guilty verdict for reasons unrelated to the law and the evidence? 52. It also is not a particularly pleasant duty to find another individual not guilty of committing a crime, especially if one's friends and families may disagree with that decision. Is there any juror who feels that if the government fails to establish each element of each charge against a defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, he or she might not be able to reach a not guilty verdict for reasons unrelated to the law and evidence? Commented [A15]: GOVERNMENT OBJECTION: The Government objects to this question as confusing and inappropriate. 53. Does any juror have any religious, philosophical, or other beliefs that would make you unable to render a guilty or a not guilty verdict in a criminal case? Commented [A16]: GOVERNMENT OBJECTION: The Government objects to the addition of this language as confusing. 12 DOJ-OGR-00005370",
