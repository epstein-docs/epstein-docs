AUSA responded one hour later: \"Just went through my files and found a folder w/ the notes I took and the documents they brought me.\" Id. She turned everything over to AUSA and other prosecutors in the office, including one other prosecutor on this trial team. Id. AUSA did not answer AUSA original question: \"[D]id [she] meet again with [Peter Skinner] or anyone else\" after the February 29, 2016 meeting with Giuffre's attorneys. Id. But AUSA certainly did not deny a second meeting or a subsequent phone call occurred. Id.\n\nBy the end of the day on December 6, 2018, AUSA had in his possession everything Giuffre and her attorneys provided to AUSA as well as AUSA extensive hand-written notes.

By the end of the day, AUSA had a \"complete handle on the landscape,\" just as he asked for a couple hours earlier.\n\nWhen AUSA appeared before Judge McMahon barely four months later, however, he told her none of this, unequivocally and falsely disavowing any role by Boies Schiller in fomenting the investigation and denying any contacts between Boies Schiller and his office before November 2018. Even though AUSA had a \"complete handle on the landscape,\" he painted an entirely different, false picture for Judge McMahon.\n\nII. The Government's Response to Maxwell's Motion.\n\nConfronted with evidence of AUSA misrepresentations to Judge McMahon, the government has filed a Response reluctantly admitting that the U.S. Attorney's Office had sustained contact with Boies Schiller in 2016.
