In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues that count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking conspiracy charge, is duplicative of either counts one or three. Maxwell's motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the Court's April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order.\n\nV. The Government's delay in bringing the charges did not violate due process\n\nMaxwell also renews her motion to dismiss the S2 indictment based on alleged improper pretrial delay. In its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Court denied Maxwell's motion, concluding that her efforts to show actual and substantial prejudice fell far short of the \"stringent standard\" necessary to prevail on such a claim. Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *9. Maxwell's motion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the record indicates that the Government's delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart Maxwell's ability to prepare a defense. However, it is sufficient to conclude that Maxwell does not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell contends that the Government's delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because potential witnesses have died, others have forgotten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.\n\nThe Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government's delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial shows otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due process bars the charges here.\n\n10\nDOJ-OGR-00004984",
