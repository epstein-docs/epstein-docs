B. Assuming the Government's Defenses Are Worthy of Belief, the Government Still Misled the Court. Even if the government's account were worthy of belief (which it is not), that doesn't get the government off the hook. The government would like this Court to believe that: (1) the February 29 meeting concerned a prosecution of Epstein only and not Maxwell; and (2) when Judge McMahon asked AUSA about his office's prior contacts with Boies Schiller concerning \"the subject of its investigation,\" Judge McMahon was referring to Epstein only and not Maxwell.
