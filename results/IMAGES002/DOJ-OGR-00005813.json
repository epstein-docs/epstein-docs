Taken together, Dr. Rocchio's expert testimony explains why victims of child sexual abuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and incremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the disclosure finally occurs. The defendant argues that testimony about delayed disclosure is unreliable, repeating some of the defendant's earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and how the opinion lacks an error rate. (Def. Mot. 3 at 15). Here, as with her opinions on attachment and coercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic literature. See Exhibit B.
