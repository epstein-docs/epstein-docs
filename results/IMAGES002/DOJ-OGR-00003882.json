B (sealed)), and thus had obviously learned of Accuser-2's claims regarding Ms. Maxwell now included in the Indictment. Indeed, an internal FBI document expressly names Ms. Maxwell as one of the individuals that the FBI's Miami office \"began investigating\" in 2006 as part of the investigation that led to the NPA.
