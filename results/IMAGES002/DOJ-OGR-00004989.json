NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn March 19, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell submitted a sealed and ex parte motion for an order authorizing four subpoenas pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. By sealed order dated March 22, 2021, the Court provided an opportunity for recipients of the subpoenas to respond to the requests by March 30, 2021, but it received no responses.\nIn an Opinion and Order temporarily filed under seal, the Court DENIES Maxwell's motion without prejudice. It does so after concluding that none of the proposed subpoenas conform to the factors first set out in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698-70 (1974).\nThe Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion and Order to defense counsel. By August 18, 2021, Maxwell is ORDERED to inform the Court whether she seeks sealing or limited redactions of the Court's opinion and of her original motion papers, justifying any such request by reference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). In addition, by that date Maxwell shall inform the Court whether she seeks full sealing or redactions of the original motion, again justifying any such request by reference to the Lugosch test.\nSO ORDERED.\nDOJ-OGR-00004989",
