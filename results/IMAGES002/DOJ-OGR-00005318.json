Maxwell, 20cr330\n\nPreliminary Remarks Prior to Questionnaire\nTo be video recorded and played on 11/4, 11/5, and 11/12\n\nHello everyone. Thank you so much for being here. And welcome to the Southern District of New York. My name is Judge Alison Nathan and I am the judge who will preside over the trial for which you have been summoned. I have recorded this message to you because you are spread out in different rooms and over different times as part of the District's COVID safety protocols. I look forward to seeing you in person as this process moves forward.\n\nWe are about to start the process of selecting a jury to try a criminal case. I'm going to briefly describe the process to you as it may be different than what some of you have previously experienced when summoned for jury duty.\n\nThe first part of the process is going to occur now. In a few minutes, after you've been sworn to tell the truth, you will fill out a questionnaire. The purpose of the questionnaire is for you to provide information to myself, to the prosecutors, to defense counsel, and to the defendant to assist all of us in determining whether you can be a fair and impartial juror in this case.\n\nWhen you are done filling out the questionnaire, you will return it to the Jury Department staff and you will be done for the day. Some of you will be asked to return for a phase two, which will involve in-person questioning by me. That is going to start on November 16. So you are free of jury service with respect to this case from whenever you finish the questionnaire until at least November 16. Some of those who are going to return will come in on November 16, some will come on November 17th, and possibly there will be one or two more days. You will get instructions before you leave here today about how you will find out whether you are going to return.\n\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00005318",
