As I instructed you earlier, one of the important principles of criminal law is that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed to be innocent. Like anyone accused of a crime in this country, Ms. Maxwell is, and must be, presumed innocent of any and all charges made against her unless and until the Government proves her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It is the Government's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the Government's burden of proof alone. The defendant has no burden to prove her innocence or to present any evidence. Are you able to follow these instructions?\n\n2. As I instructed you earlier, until you are excused from this case, you may not read, listen to, or watch any accounts of this case reported on television, the radio, or over the Internet or social media. Jurors are also not allowed to do any research regarding this case, whether over the Internet, on social media, or in any other manner. The case must be decided solely on the basis of the evidence presented in the courtroom. Would you have any difficulty following these rules, which are binding on every juror?\n\n3. When you filled out your questionnaire, you were told not to research, read, or watch anything about the case or learn anything about the case. Have you, even though you were instructed not to do that, done that anyway? Have you looked things up on the internet, even if you just Googled it? If you have, now is the time to tell me.\n\nGeneral Ability to Serve\n\n4. On your questionnaire, you stated that you do not have any unmovable commitments between November 29 and approximately January 15. Does that continue to be accurate?\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-00005311",
