Villafaña raised the issue in writing to her supervisors in early September, but there is no evidence showing whether her supervisors affirmatively rejected Villafaña's contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims, ignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended uncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government's plea proposal. OPR notes that its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the passage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafaña recalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and Menchel contended that Villafaña's recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred, the timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafaña about victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely.

That belief accurately reflected the Department's position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find evidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and Villafaña told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting to the agreement if they learned of it.
