This deadline will allow the defense adequate time to review and raise objections to any Government exhibits.\nDefense Disclosures\nThe Government proposes that the defense be required to provide expert witness disclosures pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(b)(1)(C) by October 4, 2021, or 8 weeks in advance of trial. This deadline will give the defendant ample time to determine what, if any, expert testimony she may seek to offer. The defense—who has had the Government's expert notice since April 23, 2021—seeks to provide expert notice 4 weeks in advance of trial, or by November 1, 2021, but such a belated disclosure would not allow adequate time in advance of trial to brief any motions regarding the admissibility of such testimony, much less by the Court's deadline.
