Dr. Rocchio, however, is not testifying about common experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical experience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present during parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on attachment and coercion. The average juror will not have knowledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and Dr. Rocchio's testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about \"grooming-by-proxy,\" a term which appears nowhere in the Government's expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9). By that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can groom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and \"prejudicial speculation.\" (Id.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr. Rocchio's testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained above. If the victim experienced attachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference whether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing the victim for abuse by a third party.
