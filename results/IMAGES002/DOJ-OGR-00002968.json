Instead, she argues that the absence of language specifically\nlimiting this provision to the USAO-SDFL demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal\ngovernment. This argument fails, for at least three reasons. First, the defendant's argument inverts\nthe holding of Annabi: in this Circuit, the presumption is that plea agreements bind only the district\nin which they are entered, absent affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence\nof express limiting language in this provision is not an affirmative indication of a broader\napplication. Accordingly, under Second Circuit law, the absence of limiting language in this\nspecific provision provides no support for the defendant's motion.\n\nSecond, the defendant's argument acknowledges that the plain terms of the NPA\nimmunized Epstein from prosecution in \"this District,\" that is, the Southern District of Florida.\nSee NPA at 2 (\"After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n7\nDOJ-OGR-00002968",
