Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-19 protocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. For more information, see https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/covid-19-coronavirus. In order to ensure additional public access, the Court will also open a public teleconference line so that members of the public may listen to the audio of the proceeding. Members of the public may call into the public teleconference line by dialing 844-291-6362 and entering access code 2921822. This phone line can accommodate approximately 4,000 callers on a first come, first serve basis. Any photographing, recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law. Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including being held in contempt of court, removal of court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), the Government must “make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights” provided to them in that section. This includes “[t]he right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding . . . involving the crime or of any release . . . of the accused.” Id. § 3771(a)(2). So that appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court’s Chambers by email by April 21, 2021 whether any alleged victims wish to attend the proceeding and whether they will attend in person or by phone. The Court will ensure access. DOJ-OGR-00003842",
