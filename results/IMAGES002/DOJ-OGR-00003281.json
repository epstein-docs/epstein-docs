Regardless of the merits of his argument, in order to get us down in time they made us an offer that included pleading to an offense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and touted that we should be happy because it was registrable. For that reason alone, I don't think we should consider allowing them to come down from their own offer, either on this issue or on time of incarceration.\n\nLefkowitz attempted to reach Acosta that night, but Acosta directed Villafaña to return the call, and told Lourie that he did not want to open \"a backchannel\" with defense counsel. Lourie instructed Villafaña, \"U can tell [J]ay that [A]lex will not agree to a nonregistration offense.\"\n\nOn the morning of Friday, September 21, 2007, Villafaña emailed Acosta informing him that \"it looks like we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein on Tuesday,\" reporting that the charging package was being reviewed by the West Palm Beach manager, and asking if anyone in the Miami office needed to review it. Villafaña also alerted Lourie that she had spoken that morning to Lefkowitz, who \"was waffling\" about Epstein pleading to a state charge that required sexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer with Krischer and Belohlavek \"to make sure the defense doesn't try to do an end run.\"\n\nThat same morning, Epstein attorney Sanchez, who had not been involved in negotiations for several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, \"[I] want to finalize the plea deal and there is only one issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that [A]lex has read all the defense submissions that would assist in his determination on this point . . . [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared to sign as soon as today.\" From his out-of-town vacation, Sloman forwarded the email to Acosta, who replied, \"Enjo[y] vacation.
