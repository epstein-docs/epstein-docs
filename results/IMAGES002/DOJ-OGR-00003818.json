She has 2 claimed $5 million in lost wages, your Honor. This is a person 3 who has worked primarily as a waitress in the last 15 years, 4 until her media sensational story was purchased from her by 5 some British press. 6 THE COURT: Anything else? 7 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, the other issues are 8 addressed in our papers. We have highlighted her incomplete 9 production on several fronts and her refusal to answer any 10 interrogatories. So I would rest on my papers with respect to 11 the other arguments. Thank you. 12 MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you, your Honor. I'd like to be 13 very clear here, your Honor. Discovery production, I've tried 14 to do that in our papers. But listening to opposing counsel 15 I'm concerned maybe she hasn't reviewed the documents we have 16 produced. We have clearly produced all of the media 17 communications she has, including records -- 18 THE COURT: All the media. 19 MS. McCAWLEY: All of the media communications. She 20 has issued wildly broad requests in this case which we have 21 complied with. We ran over 200 search terms. Her request No. 22 5 alone seeks communications with over 100 individuals. And we 23 have complied, your Honor. This is coming from the defendant 24 who until Monday night, when you directed her to produce 25 privileged information, has only produced two e-mails in this SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
