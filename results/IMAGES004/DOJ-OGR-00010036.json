I did not see it before the July 15th conference call with\n5 the Court.\n6 Q. Do you think it was before you filed your July 21st letter?\n7 A. Yes, it was.\n8 Q. You were not on the July 15th conference call, correct?\n9 A. That's correct.\n10 Q. You saw a transcript of the conference call?\n11 A. Ms. Trzaskoma let me know about it immediately after that,\n12 and I also read the transcript when it became available.\n13 Q. Approximately when was that? Was that before you filed\n14 your July 21st letter?\n15 A. Oh, yes, within a day.\n16 Q. You're accustomed to get daily or -- in other words, this\n17 was not an instance where you ordered like a 30-day-out\n18 transcript?\n19 A. Oh, no. We had to respond, so I read the transcript to\n20 make sure that I knew what Judge Pauley was directing us to do.\n21 Q. At the point at which you saw those emails, Ms. Brune, at\n22 the very least you knew that Ms. Trzaskoma's statements to the\n23 Court in that conference call were not correct?\n24 A. I disagree.\n25 Q. Did she reveal to the Court what she knew?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
