In the past, coupling voir dire with prospective jurors swearing an oath to tell the truth was a powerful way to eliminate bias, but the oath no longer carries the force that it once did. As a former Chief Judge of this Court remarked:\n\nWhen our judicial system was established and the requirement of an oath or affirmation on the part of a witness was borrowed from the British common law, the swearing of an oath meant something—namely, that the court could be fairly sure that a witness would tell the truth. In the time of our Founding Fathers, witnesses believed that they would be subject to severe and perhaps immediate Divine retribution if they lied under oath on the witness stand, based on the Ninth Commandment’s proscription, handed down by God to Moses that “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor” (Exodus, Ch. 20, Verse 16 (King James Version)). Unfortunately, the sanctity of the oath taken by witnesses at trial has been significantly eroded and laced with skepticism in recent years.\n\nUnited States v. Ianniello, 740 F. Supp. 171, 179 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (Bricant, C.J.), rev’d in part, United States v.
