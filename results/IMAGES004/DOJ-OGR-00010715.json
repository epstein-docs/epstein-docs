Sadly, the accurate count of victims will never be known. My book \"Silenced No More\" chronicles it as a \"journey to hell and back\".\n\nAlthough I have escaped the hellish trap set by Epstein, Maxwell and others, I continue, now 17 years later, to suffer from the horrific trauma it caused.\n\nI came to New York at age 22, wanting to start my life over after an incredibly abusive relationship. I hoped to attend FIT and work in the fashion industry.\n\nSoon after arriving, I met an Epstein/Maxwell recruiter named Natalya Malyshev in a club. She befriended me and, soon after that, arranged for me to meet Jeffery. She described him as a kind philanthropist who could help me get into FIT and provide much-needed support, something which was alien to me.\n\nOver the next seven to eight months, I became, against my will, nothing more than a human sex toy with a heartbeat and soul for the entertainment of Epstein, Maxwell and others. Sometimes I was subjected to sexual predation multiple times per day, both in his New York mansion and on his private island St. Little James in the US Virgin Islands. On one visit to the island, the sexual demands, degradation and humiliation became so horrific that I tried to escape by attempting to jump off a cliff into shark-infested waters, but was caught by Maxwell and company moments before jumping. At the time, the extremely risky escape seemed more appealing than being raped one more time.\n\nAs the evidence at the trial of Ms. Maxwell proved, and my own experience confirms, Maxwell was Epstein's right-hand woman. She was the manager of several recruiters and many\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010715",
