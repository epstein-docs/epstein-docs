Didn't you tell us a few moments ago that you and Ms. Brune\n4 had specifically decided that you were not going to include\n5 what your firm knew prior to receiving the government letter in\n6 your brief, yes or no?\n7 A. Yes.\n8 Q. So are you saying, then, that you were not trying to convey\n9 the notion through the facts section of your brief that you had\n10 learned of the Appellate Division report only after you had\n11 received the letter from the government?\n12 A. No, we weren't trying to convey that impression.\n13 MR. OKULA: May I have a moment, your Honor?\n14 THE COURT: Take your time.\n15 (Pause)\n16 Q.
