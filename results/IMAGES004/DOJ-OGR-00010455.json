See PSR at 65.\nRegarding a sentencing recommendation, Probation has identified several mitigating factors. Maxwell is 61 years old, and a guidelines sentence may be tantamount to a lifetime term of imprisonment. The defendant has a reported history of philanthropy, charitable work, and helping others namely her work with the Clinton Global Initiative, The TerraMar Project, her use of EMT skills to help others, and her tutoring of inmates at the MDC. We further acknowledge that Maxwell is not solely responsible for the horrendous and irreparable damage caused by the decade.\nPSR at 66-67.\nAdjustment to Incarceration\nDespite her extraordinarily restrictive conditions of detention, Ms. Maxwell has availed herself of any programming or work opportunity available to her. While in solitary confinement, she completed six courses, but until transferred to general population, she never had the opportunity to make use of that training. Post-trial she was permitted to work as an orderly which has continued in general population. Since placed in general population, she has eagerly provided a wide variety of assistance to the women is her unit, including GED tutoring. See PSR. ยง16. In addition, she has participated in and completed several educational courses. See PSR ยง15.\n8 Ms. Maxwell is planning to appeal her conviction following sentencing. Accordingly, any discussion of the trial evidence in this submission is not an admission by Ms. Maxwell as to its accuracy or veracity.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-00010455",
