  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 741 Filed 08/10/22 Page 66 of 106 79 LBTVMAX3 Opening - Ms. Sternheim alleged to be a victim in this case. Nonetheless, she settled her claim with the fund for three and-a-quarter million dollars. She assisted the government and she will be here. And in turn, that assisted her claim. But she's also seeking assistance from the government to help her to get a visa, a special visa for government witnesses. Now, three and a quarter million dollars is a lot of money, but it cannot buy you a visa. And maybe her testimony will. You will evaluate that. Now, the last accuser is Carolyn. And admittedly, she had a troubled past, lived a dangerous lifestyle, was using drugs during the period of time that she interacted with Epstein. Let me just stop for a second. There's a different time period that we're in now. We are now in about 2002, whereas Jane, Annie, and Kate were in the mid to late '90s. Carolyn was introduced to Epstein not by Ghislaine, by a woman named Virginia Roberts. Roberts was paid by Epstein to recruit females for him to get massages. She offered the opportunity to Carolyn to meet Epstein, and Carolyn readily agreed. The evidence that you will hear with regard to Carolyn, which relate to the trafficking charges in Counts Five and Six, counts that only relate to Carolyn, had nothing to do with Ghislaine.
