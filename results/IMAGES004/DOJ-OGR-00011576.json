These kids had hopes and dreams for their future and the defendant used those dreams as her tool to abuse them. We ask the Court to take an unflinching look at the defendant's actions and consider what that tells you about who she really is. What kind of person persuades young girls to massage the feet of a middle-aged man? What kind of person gets a 16-year-old girl all alone at a ranch in the middle of nowhere and tells her to take off her clothes and get on a massage table so that she can grope that girl's chest? What kind of person teaches a 14-year-old girl how a middle-aged man likes his penis to be touched? What kind of person sees a 17-year-old girl on the street and pulls over so that she can persuade that girl to come to a house of horrors where that young girl will be trafficked for sex? What kind of person flies around on a plane with underage girls so that when her boyfriend travels, he always has a young girl to touch? What kind of person would use their privilege, their power in this world to intentionally prey on the vulnerable, young girls from struggling families: Girls without fathers, girls who needed help. These are the actions of a person who was indifferent to the suffering of other human beings. The defendant's actions were not a one-time mistake; not at all. Maxwell was an adult woman, and she made the choice, week in, week out for years to commit crimes with SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011576",
