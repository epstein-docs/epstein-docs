You\n9 cannot have a case in which there is not in a sense a choice if\n10 it's coming up in an ineffective assistance claim. I can cite\n11 you to Breakiron and Johnson v. Armontront. In our brief\n12 lawyers are making choices. In those cases the question is are\n13 they informed choices, are they reasonable choices, are they\n14 competent choices, are they strategic choices.

We're told that there\n21 can't be any doubt that these transactions were effectuated so\n22 that there would be tax lawyers and tax losses in the prior\n23 year and it's ludicrous to think otherwise. Of course that's\n24 why the transactions were being done.
