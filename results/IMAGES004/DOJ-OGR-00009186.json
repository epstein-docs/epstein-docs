  "full_text": "1/26/22, 3:30 PM Case 1:20-cr-00303-LGS Document 615 Filed 12/29/21 Page 12 of 16 Scotty revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual abuse and that it did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty Today Scotty is completely satisfied that they reached the right verdict and that, with Maxwell's conviction, justice has been done. He says that he believes she will spend the rest of her life in prison unless a deal is done to reduce her sentence. But said that he had no idea of the severity of the potential sentence until after the verdict was reached and that it would not have influenced anything if he had. He said, 'It satisfies me to know that we did our due diligence and that we brought justice for these victims, for these girls who are now women.' He said that, ultimately, he and the rest of the jurors were convinced that Epstein and Maxwell's lives were so 'intertwined' that it was inconceivable that she was not fully aware of his crimes. She aided and abetted, he said. And with her conviction she wasn't paying or being held accountable for Epstein's crimes as her attorneys have argued, Scotty said, instead she was answering to her own guilt because she was 'every bit as culpable' as he. According to Scotty, 'The prosecution proved their case beyond reasonable doubt.'
