Mollo Building One Saint Andrew's Plaza New York, New York 10007 April 1, 2022 By ECF The Honorable Alison J. Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007B Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: The Government submits this letter to respectfully request that the Court exclude time under the Speedy Trial Act with respect to Counts Seven and Eight, from today's date until April 22, 2022. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A). The Court previously excluded time through April 1, 2022, finding that the exclusion of time would further the interests of justice by permitting the parties to research and brief post-trial motions. (See Dkt. No. 579). Those motions remain pending. Accordingly, because the pending motions affect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January 10, 2022 letter (Dkt. No. 574), the Government respectfully submits that the exclusion of time would further the interests of justice. 1 DOJ-OGR-00010319",
