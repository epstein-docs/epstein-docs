In the end, whatever happens with\n2 respect to these matters before the Court, I think that it is\n3 in everyone's interest that they travel together wherever\n4 they're going.\n5 Are there any other matters that counsel want to raise\n6 at this time before we fix a schedule for the submission of\n7 these briefs?\n8 MR. OKULA: No, your Honor. I was just going to\n9 suggest most respectfully that perhaps if counsel for the\n10 government and defendants could confer momentarily about a\n11 proposed schedule, then we could propose one to the Court.\n12 THE COURT: That's fine with me.\n13 MR. GAIR: Judge, Mr. Okula is on vacation next week,\n14 so I'd like to suggest one week.\n15 MR. SHECHTMAN: Judge, if we might be heard?\n16 THE COURT: Go ahead.\n17 MR. SHECHTMAN: We want very much to accommodate Mr.\n18 Okula's vacation, seriously. He has suggested three weeks. I\n19 start a trial on Tuesday, a month-long trial. I fully\n20 appreciate that I have to write this brief on weekends, and I\n21 will, but an extra week would be very helpful. If we could get\n22 a month, that would be grand.\n23 THE COURT: Fine. You've got it. Do you want to file\n24 your briefs on March 16, your initial briefs, or do you want\n25 March 23?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010119",
