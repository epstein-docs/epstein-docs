Tr. 503-11.\nC. Phone Records\nContemporaneous phone records for Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, the accusers, and others that could have been used to rebut the government's proof were also not available to the defense. For example, Carolyn testified that Ms. Maxwell would call her to set up massage appointments. Tr. 1527. This was important evidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the sex trafficking charges in Counts Five and Six. Carolyn's claim could have been disproven with contemporaneous phone records. However, because a complete set of Ms. Maxwell's phone records—as well as phone records for Carolyn, her mother, and her boyfriend—were not available, the defense could not challenge this claim.\nD. Property Records\nThe defense also did not have access to property records for Epstein's various residences, which would have rebutted the accusers' testimony concerning the timing of the alleged sexual abuse. For example, Jane testified that she began being sexually molested by Epstein in his home in New York when she was 14 years old. Tr. 316-320. Jane described the house as follows:\n[I]t looked more like a building than a house. It was eight stories, his massive eight-story house building where you walk through these giant doors and then there was, like, another security door to go in. And it had an elevator and it was eight stories.\nTr. 317. It is clear that Jane was describing Epstein's townhouse on East 71st Street. Moreover, her description of the massage room where she was molested matched photographs of the massage room at the 71st Street house. Tr. 320. Jane turned 14 years old in August 1994. But",
