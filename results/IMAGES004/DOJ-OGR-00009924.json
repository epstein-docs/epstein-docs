All right.\n4 MR. GAIR: Your Honor, at this time I would move the admission of PMD3.\n5 THE COURT: Any objection?\n6 MR. OKULA: No, your Honor.\n7 THE COURT: PMD 3 is received in evidence.\n8 (Exhibit PMD 3 received in evidence)\n9\n10 Q.

Yes, sir.\n12 Q. Okay, and if you look at beginning at line 8, the Court says, \"Do you want to complete this affidavit now so that I can make a determination as to whether or not you can afford counsel?\"\n13 And you said, \"I can't afford counsel, that's correct, sir.\"\n14 Do you remember that happening?\n15 A.
