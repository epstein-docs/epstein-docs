The Defendant argues that Juror 50 was actually biased because his post-trial statements reveal that at the time of voir dire he regarded himself as a non-neutral advocate for the victims. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 6.4 In particular, she relies on Juror 50's post-trial interviews, in which he \"proclaim[ed]\" that the guilty verdict was for \"for all the victims.\" Id. But these post-trial statements do not establish that Juror 50 was actually biased against the Defendant. The evidence at trial established that there was more than one victim of the Defendant's crimes, making Juror 50's post-trial statement reasonable. And, more importantly, Juror 50's view of the Defendant after the thirteen-day trial, during which he heard evidence that swayed him and eleven other jurors to convict the Defendant on five counts, does not shed light on any bias he allegedly harbored \"before he heard the evidence presented.\" Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 439-40 & n.4 (emphasis in original) (rejecting argument that juror's post-trial statements that the verdict was \"a victory for the little guy who loses money in the markets\" and that the defendant \"thought she was above everything\" revealed bias).\n2. Implied and Inferred Bias\nThe Defendant's central argument is that the Court should imply—based on Juror 50's personal history of sexual abuse, post-trial actions, and hearing testimony—that Juror 50 was biased against the Defendant.
