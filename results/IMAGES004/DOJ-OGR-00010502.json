These are the actions of a fundamentally good and decent person, with great empathy for others and a capacity for altruism. This is the real - the true - Ghislaine whom I know and love as her brother.\nMy sister was fortunate - as I and my siblings were too - in benefitting from an outstanding formal education which culminated for Ghislaine with a good degree from Oxford University. She put that achievement to good effect, using amongst other skills her gift for foreign languages and networking abilities to start up, invest in and develop numerous businesses in the UK and in the US, employing people, making a difference, making a contribution.\nPerhaps her single most important contribution is to have converted a lifelong passion for conservation and the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, to create a robust awareness program and a thriving social network around the oceans at a time when they were perhaps not so high up the conservation agenda as they are today. TerraMar ran from 2012 to 2019 and at its peak had hundreds of thousands of visitors to its website and many thousands of subscribers to its programs. None of this would have happened but for Ghislaine's determination, her hard work and capacity for organizing and mobilizing and sheer perseverance as well as financial generosity in sustaining TerraMar over the years.\nThose personal efforts of hers (along with others from key corporate supporters and sponsors), were acknowledged when the U.N. made oceans conservation one of their 17 Sustainable Development Goals for 2015-30.\nI believe Ghislaine still has much to contribute to the world if she is given a meaningful opportunity to do so.\nSincerely yours,\nIan Maxwell",
