For weeks I sat in this courtroom anonymously, only revealing my identity the day before the verdict. I had to see justice myself. At the age of 48, I feel as if I'm just starting my life. All those things I assumed I would have in life, the things that my siblings and my friends have achieved: A career, success, partner, family, a home, a legacy to be proud of leaving behind were jeopardized for more than two and a half decades. The only pronounced difference between my life experience and theirs is that one day when I was doing my job, I met Ghislaine Maxwell who fed me to Jeffrey Epstein.
