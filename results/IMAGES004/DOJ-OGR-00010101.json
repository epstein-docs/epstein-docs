Would you tell the Court what was said between you and Ms.\n5 Trzaskoma at that time.\n6 A. Yes. I recall that we had a conversation. I believe it\n7 was as we were walking across Foley Square towards Duane\n8 Street. She told me that there was a person with the same name\n9 as -- I don't recall whether she said Juror No. 1 or Ms.\n10 Conrad, but a person with the same name who was a disbarred\n11 lawyer but that it was not the same person as Juror No. 1.\n12 I began formulating a question to say, how do you\n13 know? She anticipated that question and said, because of the\n14 voir dire. I began formulating the question of, what question\n15 during the voir dire would have disclosed that? She\n16 anticipated that question as I was speaking it and said\n17 something to the effect that her educational background did not\n18 include law school. I said, then it's not the same person?\n19 And she said right. By that time we had finished crossing the\n20 street.\n21 Q. Any further discussion about Juror No. 1?\n22 A. Not with Ms. Trzaskoma during that time period.\n23 Q. Any further discussion with anyone at the Brune firm\n24 regarding Juror No. 1 during that time period?\n25 A. No.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00010101",
