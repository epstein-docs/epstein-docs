The main content is a short exchange between the court and a lawyer, MS. DAVIS. The page number is 27, and it includes a footer with the name and contact information of the reporting company, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. There is a handwritten 'oOo' on the page, likely indicating the end of the transcript or a section."
