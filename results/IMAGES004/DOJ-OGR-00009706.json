The defense responded in part that \"asking the questions live when the\njurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by\nthe parties will aid in the selection of an impartial and fair jury.\" Id. The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\nJuror No. 50 appeared for his voir dire on November 16. Because Juror No. 50\nanswered \"no\" to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual\nharassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just\nseven pages of transcript. TR 11/6/2021, pp 128-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 50 whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell's defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers' memories.\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nbackground), Juror No. 50 was not always truthful. For example, the Court asked Juror\nNo. 50 if he used social media. Juror No. 50 said that he recently ended a relationship so\nhe \"deleted them\" and was \"fully off it right now.\" TR 11/16/2021, p 133. Asked \"[w]hat\ndo you use, Facebook, Twitter,\" Juror No. 50 answered, \"I used Facebook and\nInstagram,\" but he did not mention any Twitter account. Id. (emphasis added). Juror No.\n50 said he deleted his accounts the week before. Id.\nIn fact, as described below, Juror No. 50 had a Twitter account (created in April\n2021) that he did not delete, and he used the account to Tweet about the interviews he\ngave following this case and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-00009706",
