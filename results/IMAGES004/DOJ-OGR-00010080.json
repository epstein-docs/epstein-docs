I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.\n11 Q. Did she ask whether anything more should be done to look\n12 into this?\n13 A. We discussed after she raised the issue with us, you know,\n14 what Juror No. 1's responses were on voir dire. We concluded\n15 that we did not believe they were the same person and we\n16 decided that we didn't need to do any more research at that\n17 point.\n18 Q. Well, you say \"we discussed.\" Tell us your best\n19 recollection what was said.\n20 A. I can't recall precisely what was said. I think what we\n21 did was we reviewed what Catherine Conrad had said on voir\n22 dire, what her responses were and to us that ruled out the\n23 possibility that she was the suspended lawyer.
