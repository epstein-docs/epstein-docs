McCawley Telephone: (954) 356-0011 Email: smccawley@bsfllp.com June 22, 2022 United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: I am counsel for Virginia Giuffre, and I am providing the following victim impact statement for the Court's consideration with respect to Maxwell's sentencing. Pursuant to the Crimes Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Virginia Giuffre qualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking from 2000 to 2002, and testimony relating to that trafficking was presented as evidence during the trial in this case. Due to a medical issue, Ms. Giuffre is unable to attend the sentencing in person and therefore respectfully requests that the Court read her statement into the record or, alternatively, allow her attorney representative Sigrid McCawley to read the statement on her behalf. Statement by Virginia Giuffre: Your honor, my name is Virginia Roberts Giuffre. For more than two years, from age 16 to 19, I was abused by Ghislaine Maxwell. Before I begin, I want to acknowledge and profusely thank the police, FBI investigators, prosecutors and judges who have invested their time and integrity in this case to hopefully set a precedent for victims and the hunters who prey upon them. Now, if it pleases the court, I would like to address my victim impact statement directly to Ghislaine Maxwell. Ghislaine, twenty-two years ago, in the summer of 2000, you spotted me at the Mar-a-Lago Hotel in Florida, and you made a choice. You chose to follow me and procure me for Jeffrey Epstein. Just hours later, you and he abused me together for the first time. Together, you damaged me physically, mentally, sexually, and emotionally. Together, you did unthinkable things that still have a corrosive impact on me to this day. I want to be clear about one thing: without question, Jeffrey Epstein was a terrible pedophile. But I never would have met Jeffrey Epstein if not for you. For me, and for so many others, you opened the door to hell. And then, Ghislaine, like a wolf in sheep's clothing, you used your femininity to betray us, and you led us all through it.
