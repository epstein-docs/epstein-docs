The interview with The Independent\n\nOn January 4, 2022, less than one week after the jury returned its verdict, Lucia Osborne-Crowley of The Independent published an article based on an interview with Juror No. 50.5 Going by the name Scotty David, Juror No. 50 told Ms. Osborne-Crowley that \"[t]his verdict is for all the victims\" and \"shows that you can be found guilty no matter your status.\" Juror No. 50 admitted to being a victim of sexual assault and abuse, telling Ms. Osborne-Crowley that he revealed the abuse to the jury and that his story was fundamental to the jury's verdict. According to Juror No. 50, the \"jury room went dead silent when he shared his story.\"\n\nJuror No. 50 explained to Ms. Osborne-Crowley how his own experience helped the jury come to believe the alleged victims despite the holes and inconsistencies in their stories. \"I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the colour of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video.\"\n\nRelying on his own experiences, Juror No. 50 refused to credit the testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, Ms. Maxwell's expert witness on memory. None of Dr. Loftus's testimony, said Juror No. 50, \"relate[d]to traumatic memory.\" Juror No. 50 explained all of this to the jury. Ms. Maxwell's accusers \"were all believable,\" Juror No. 50 said. \"Nothing they said felt to me like a lie.\" Sometimes, he said, you can misremember trivial details of a traumatic event without every doubting the core of the memory.\n\n5 https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/maxwell-juror-account-abuse-b1986478.html",
