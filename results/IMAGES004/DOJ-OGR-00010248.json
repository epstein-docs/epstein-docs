  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 645 Filed 03/11/22 Page 33 of 50 33 M38TMAX1 THE COURT: I will ask the question how does he reconcile the statement that he didn't think anyone would know with the fact that he was posting on social media. MR. EVERDELL: I think we also need some follow-up questions that we proposed in our letter about his belief about victim memory, because I think that goes to his ability to evaluate the evidence fairly and impartially. THE COURT: I will deny that. MR. EVERDELL: I believe also he said in his answers that he didn't hope to be on the jury but if he is going to be on a jury, it might as well be something interesting. I'm paraphrasing, but that's the import of his comment. I think we need some follow up about what he meant by that comment. Why was it that he found this interesting? Was it some reflection of the fact that it involved victims of sexual abuse, and because he was the victim of sexual abuse himself that made it interesting for him? THE COURT: I will ask him what he meant. MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I may have an issue. I thought the last question about following your instructions, I think he said no. And insofar as saying no, how did he not follow your instructions after he filled out the questionnaire? THE COURT: Okay. I will ask that question and then I will ask the government's question about whether he followed my instructions during voir dire. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00010248",
