See Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 440. Even if Juror 50 were selfishly seeking his fifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garnered the same amount of media attention after a verdict of acquittal.” Id.\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror 50] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5–6.

A juror’s view of a case and defendant would necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors of the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 317 F.

For example, Juror 50 noted at the hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury deliberations” and to explain why he “believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was provided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial matter, that these statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common sense and life experiences to adjudge guilt.
