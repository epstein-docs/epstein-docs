Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, NY 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: The parties respectfully submit this joint letter in response to the Court's email earlier today regarding prospective jurors that the Court proposes to strike from the list of jurors proceeding to voir dire. I. The Parties' Positions Regarding the Court's List The parties have conferred about the Court's proposed list of strikes. The government has no objection to the Court's proposal to strike all jurors on the list. The defense largely agrees with the Court's proposal, but requests that a limited number of jurors on the list proceed to voir dire so that the Court can inquire further about the nature of any travel or hardship conflict that these jurors have identified. More specifically, the defense agrees that the following jurors should be excused from voir dire: 23, 114, 215, 257, 338, 420, 422, 542, 561 2051282.1 DOJ-OGR-00011384",
