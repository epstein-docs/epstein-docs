Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\n\nDear Judge Nathan\n\nMy name is Harriett Jagger and I have known Ghislaine for 45 years since we were at school together. We have always kept in touch and I have been writing to her regularly whilst she has been in prison.\n\nI am of course aware of the charges of which she has been convicted but my love, care, support and lifelong friendship for her remains unchanged. I believe that true friendship and understanding of what a person's life journey takes, with its many twists and turns is always a test.\n\nI first met Ghislaine running down a corridor a school, she was 15 and carrying two pairs of corduroys, one green, one black, she had great energy, a huge smile and I liked her immediately. She was very popular at school, bright, kind, engaging and fun. Being close friends we have of course had the social times, the help with advice on personal issues, the connection of like-minded people. I totally trust Ghislaine to always be there for me the same as I am for her.\n\nWhen I was going through a sad separation from my husband and living in a lowly rental, Ghislaine would often ring me with a 'call me if you need cheering up', knocking on the door To see if I was OK, 'do you want me to nip to the supermarket for anything'. I have always liked her straight forward intelligent advice, her strong personality but with a genuine\n\n1\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010510",
