In determining what evidence you accept, you must make your own evaluation from the testimony of each of the witnesses and the exhibits that are received in evidence. It is essential, however, that you keep an open mind until you've heard all of the evidence in the case. A case can be presented only step by step, witness by witness, before all evidence is before you. As you know from your experience, you can hear one person give his or her version of an event and think it sounds very impressive or even compelling; and yet, upon hearing another person's version of the same event or even the same person cross-examined with respect to the event, things may seem very different. In other words, there may be another side to any witness's story. You should use your common sense and good judgment to evaluate each witness's testimony based on all of the circumstances. Again, I can't emphasize too strongly that you must keep an open mind until the trial is over. You should not reach any conclusion until you have all of the evidence before you. As I mentioned during jury selection, this case has received and will continue to receive significant attention in the media. To protect their privacy, I have permitted witnesses, if they choose, to be referred to in open court by either their first name or a pseudonym.
