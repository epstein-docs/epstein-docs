The extraordinarily harsh conditions Ms. Maxwell has faced during COVID warrant a downward variance.\n\nThis Court has \"repeatedly found that the COVID-19 pandemic presents an extraordinary and unprecedented threat to incarcerated individuals.\" United States v.

Aug. 23, 2021) (citations omitted). \"[T]he existence of COVID-19 has created harsher conditions, and that's a fact that the Court should take into account.\" United States v. Crispin, 19 Cr. 323 (JSR) (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2020), Dkt. 124 at 9. It is beyond dispute that the pandemic has made incarceration harsher and more punitive than would otherwise have been the case. This is because the federal prisons, as 'prime candidates' for the spread of the virus, have had to impose onerous lockdowns and restrictions that have made the incarceration of prisoners far harsher than normal.\" United States v. Rodriguez, 492 F. Supp. 3d 306, 311 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (internal citations omitted); see also United States v. Henareh, 11 Cr. 93 (JSR), 2021 WL 119016, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 13, 2021) (\"the heightened restrictions imposed upon all prisoners during the pandemic may enhance the deterrent effect of prison sentences served during the pandemic by making the conditions of confinement harsher, both physically and psychologically, than they would otherwise normally be.\"); United States v. McRae, 17 Cr. 643 (PAE), 2021 WL 142277, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2021) (\"a day spent in prison under extreme lockdown and in well-founded fear of contracting a once-in-a-century deadly virus exacts a price on a prisoner beyond that imposed by an ordinary day in prison. While such conditions are not intended as punishment, incarceration in such circumstances is, unavoidably, experienced as more punishing\").\n\n31\nDOJ-OGR-00010478",
