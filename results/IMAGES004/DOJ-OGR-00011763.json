But there were several personal assistants that housed -- that kind of had base of operation in that room. THE COURT: Ms. Comey, it's 4:59, so I'm going to stop you here for the evening. Members of the jury, we're going to break for the evening. A few things to go over. I know you asked Ms. Williams about the schedule. As I indicated during the jury selection process, we do anticipate sitting each day. We're going to start promptly with you at 9:30 in the morning, so I ask you to arrive between 9:00 and 9:15. Earlier will be fine. Ms. Williams will have the jury room open for you, we'll have some breakfast items and snacks. Please come by 9:00 to 9:15 or earlier so we can start promptly at 9:30 and we'll sit to 5:00 again and that's our standard schedule. I know you asked about the holiday schedule. The current plan, as I indicated during jury selection, is that the week of Christmas, we'll sit Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So that's the 20th, 21st, and 22nd of December, and the week of New Year's we'll sit Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the 27th, 28th, and 29th of December. That's the schedule.
