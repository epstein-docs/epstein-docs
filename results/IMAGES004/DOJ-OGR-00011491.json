The Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination. Decisions of the Administrator are not subject to review or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\n4. How much money from Jeffrey Epstein's Estate is available to the Program?\nThere is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to compensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the Administrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation.\n5. When did the Program become effective?\nThe Program became effective on June 25, 2020 (\"Effective Date\"). The Administrator has reached out to previously identified victims and will provide other individuals with an opportunity to participate in the Program through an online registration process, described in Section III below.\nII. Eligibility Requirements\n1. Who is eligible to participate in the Program?\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein, regardless of where they were harmed, when they were harmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they have previously filed a lawsuit against or settled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\n2. If the Administrator determines that I am eligible to participate in the Program, does that mean that the Administrator has determined that I am eligible to receive compensation?\nNo. The fact you are sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information only means that the Administrator has determined that you are eligible to participate in the Program - that is, that you can submit a claim for consideration. It does not mean that the Administrator has determined that you are eligible to receive compensation. That eligibility determination is made only after you submit the Claim Form and all required documentation, and after that information is evaluated by the Administrator. For more information, please see Section III.\n4 | Page\nDOJ-OGR-00011491",
