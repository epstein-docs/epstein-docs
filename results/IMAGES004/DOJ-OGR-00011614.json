I also reject the repeated allegations that Ms. Maxwell, who was provided extensive access to computers and legal materials, as well as to highly involved counsel, was in any way not able to prepare for trial or sentencing. I will say that I think a lack of full candor regarding treatment is consistent with a lack of candor to Pretrial Services and to the Court regarding finances, as well as the dishonesty that I have concluded occurred during the civil deposition that makes up the perjury counts. Overall, the behavior appears consistent with a pattern of deflection of blame. I will note that I was -- I would emphasize that the sentencing submission talks about these complaints and blames others but did not express remorse or acceptance of responsibility. Ms. Sternheim and Ms. Maxwell today acknowledge the courage of the victims who testified and who spoke, talked about the pain and anguish that they have expressed, to some extent acknowledged the impact on them and their suffering, and I think that is important for the victims to hear. What there wasn't expressed was acceptance of responsibility. Now let me be clear. Ms. Maxwell is fully entitled to exercise her constitutional -- was fully entitled and is fully entitled to exercise her constitutional right to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
