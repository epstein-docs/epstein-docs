Sadly, the marriage could not survive the negative impact of this case nor a husband's association with his dishonored wife.\n\nMs. Maxwell has always worked hard. Her many educational, occupational, and avocational accomplishments include becoming an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), a helicopter pilot, a submersible pilot, a banker; partnering with the Cleveland Clinic to establish a telemedicine platform to enable people in remote areas to obtain quality medical treatment; helping develop the Clinton Global Initiative; and supporting a variety non-profit and charitable organizations. In 2012, at age 50, she turned a lifelong passion for the oceans into a non-profit environmental organization, The TerraMar Project, with the mission of creating a \"global ocean community\" based on the idea of shared ownership and responsibility of the global \"commons\" (the high seas and international waters). She spoke on topics related to ocean conservation, giving TED Talks, and delivering a speech at the United Nations. National Geographic and Oxford University were among the organizations that collaborated in support of the project. The TerraMar Project was closed after Epstein's death to spare her partners from invasion of privacy by the press due their association with her. See PSR ¶178.\n\nLetters from Family and Friends\n\nAccompanying letters from family and remaining friends (most having cut ties due to fear of association and the lure of \"cancel culture\") attest to Ghislaine's character; each offers a first-person narrative of some aspect of her life in sharp contrast to her characterization as a villain, rich heiress, and vapid socialite.
