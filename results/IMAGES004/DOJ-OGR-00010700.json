New York, 337 U.S. 241, 247 (explaining that in order to determine an “appropriate sentence” judges need “the fullest information possible concerning the defendant’s life and characteristics.”). The Federal Rules of Evidence do not limit the evidence that the court can consider at sentencing. See Fed. R. Evid. 1101(d)(3); United States v. Croxford, 324 F. Supp. 2d 1230, 1240 (D. Utah 2004); United States v. Fennel, 65 F.3d 812, 813 (10th Cir. 1995). See also United States v. Cofield, No. 17-CR-610, 2019 WL 4879331, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2019).

The critical words, “no limitation,” grant a sentencing court extremely broad discretionary authority to consider wide-ranging unlimited information about Maxwell’s “background, character, and conduct”—crucial information clearly possessed by Sarah and Elizabeth.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized the broad scope of this provision.
