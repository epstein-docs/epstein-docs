  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 663 Filed 06/15/22 Page 45 of 77\n\nRobert Maxwell himself died in 1991.\n\nSo you see how our families met, how we've all been friends for over 60 years and how I've maintained a close relationship with the Maxwell clan for most of my life. Though I was spending more of my time with the older siblings who were closest to my age, I also chose deliberately to spend time as well with Ian, Kevin and Ghislaine, from early on until they were soon going to prep school together during term-time. You may know that their father was narcissistic, demanding and highly controlling. He let them know early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity. So, all the kids knew they had to \"make it on their own\" despite the wealth and privilege in which they were growing up.\n\nAs I got to know each of these kids, including Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one worked very hard at their jobs, as Bob wouldn't bear any idleness, and each strove for their father's and mother's respect through their intelligence and their own hard work. So it didn't surprise me that in her prep school classes, as well as her bachelor's work at Oxford, where Ghislaine had followed her elder siblings, she produced exemplary grades and a reputation as a serious student. I also personally noticed that Ghislaine was quick-witted, smart, full of initiative and good humor, and sincerely caring towards everyone she knew.\n\nSo let me share, your Honor, my core point here. Ghislaine is a very smart and sensitive person. I observed this since I met her at age 5. I've already heard through her sister Isabel that she has truly regretted ever meeting Jeffrey Epstein. She has been severely punished with nightly awakenings every 15 minutes in her years already now in jail. She lost her bid for retrial. Like other smart, insightful\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010491",
