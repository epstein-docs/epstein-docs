[Sarah's VIS (“Last year I travelled to New York from England…to attend Maxwell's trial. It was therapeutic to hear the testimony of the four brave victim-witnesses, whose experience paralleled my own, to know that I was not alone and that our story was finally being told for the world to hear. I am grateful that the jury believed the victims and returned a guilty verdict.
