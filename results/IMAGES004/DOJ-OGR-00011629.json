Defense, any objection to me including, in pre-opening preliminary instructions, what I determine is an appropriate instruction regarding witnesses testifying under pseudonyms? MS. STERNHEIM: No. THE COURT: Thank you. MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor. There was just one more issue that I believe Ms. Moe was going to address. THE COURT: Thank you. Ms. Moe. MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. I'm going to bring to the Court's attention an issue that came to our attention regarding prospective Juror No. 93. We learned, following voir dire, based on publicly available information, that that prospective juror is an attorney at a financial institution. At trial, there will be a witness from that financial institution. He is more than a records custodian in the sense that he is an executive director at that financial institution. And he'll be talking about certain financial transactions. During our meetings with this witness, an attorney for the financial institution had been present along with outside counsel for the financial institution. So we want to just bring that to the Court's attention. We flagged that for the defense as well. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011629",
