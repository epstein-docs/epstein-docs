But I don't think you can read that much into it, and I don't think that in fairness to Mr. Parse the record supports that. But I understand your Honor's views of the matter. I can't say more.\nTHE COURT: Other than the alleged deficiencies by the Brune firm regarding Juror No. 1, was Parse's counsel otherwise constitutionally effective?\nMR. SHECHTMAN: Look, I've never read a trial record where I didn't wish I wish they would have preserved that issue, I wish they would have made that argument, I think that cross-examination could have been stronger. I came away from that trial thinking, boy, that Barry Berke is a great cross-examiner.\nIf you asked me was it constitutionally adequate, you bet. It was very solid defense by a group of very good lawyers. So, that's one's easy for me.\nTHE COURT: Can you think of any circumstance where a Court could find both a waiver to an impartial jury and effective assistance of counsel?\nMR. SHECHTMAN: Yes. I think. The simplest one is if it really was a strategic decision, take the most blatant case, the lawyer said to themselves free bite at the apple, don't tell the judge. If we get an acquittal the great thing about the double jeopardy clause is it's over. That is a waiver\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
