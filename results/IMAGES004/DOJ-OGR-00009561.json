Bressler, No. 20-cv-3617 (ER), 2020 WL 5441497, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2020). Accordingly, a high presumption of access attaches. For the reasons stated in this Court's prior order, this presumption of access is not outweighed by the possibility of media interest in the document. See Dkt. No. 596 at 3. Nor is sealing necessary to safeguard a possible hearing for the reasons stated above. Finally, any privacy interest Juror 50 may have had in his questionnaire, see Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., 464 U.S. 501, 511-12 (1984), has at least been greatly diminished, if not extinguished, since his public comments. The Court further notes that prospective jurors had the opportunity to request that particular questionnaire answers remain confidential; Juror 50 did not make any such request. Accordingly, Juror 50's privacy interest in the questionnaire is now outweighed by the presumption of access. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119-20.

Conclusion\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court will hold a hearing regarding Juror 50's answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.
