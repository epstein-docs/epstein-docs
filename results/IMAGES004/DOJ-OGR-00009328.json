My primary method of narrowing the information was to\n2 listen to the sworn testimony on voir dire. But certainly if\n3 what your question is could I have launched some kind of full\n4 scale private investigative effort on each member of the voir\n5 dire or each seated juror, I did not do that.\n6 Q. Did you even ask Ms. Trzaskoma what was the middle initial?\n7 Because you had a middle initial, correct?\n8 A. I did not ask that question.\n9 Q. That would have been one way to narrow down the\n10 information, correct?\n11 A. You know, when you say you had the middle initial, I'm\n12 answering the firm had the middle initial. As to whether Ms.\n13 Trzaskoma was focusing on the middle initial at that point, I\n14 don't know, but I did not focus on the middle initial until\n15 after the juror sent her letter to the government and then\n16 three weeks later the government disclosed it to us.\n17 Q.
