See 3513-037 at 3 (FBI 302) (Kate saying she lived at an apartment in the Belgravia neighborhood of London); id. at 8 (describing Ms. Maxwell's Kinnerton home as \"across the street\" from a pub \"called 'Nags Head,'\" which is in Belgravia).\nUntil Kate testified and committed to one of these versions of events, Ms. Maxwell could not have known whether the 1996 Agreement would be relevant and admissible at trial. After all, if Kate had testified that she visited Ms. Maxwell in 1994 at Ms. Maxwell's home in the Kensington neighborhood of London, the 1996 Agreement for the sale of the Kinnerton Street home in the Belgravia neighborhood of London would have been irrelevant. See Fed. R. Evid. 401, 402. Because Ms. Maxwell did not intend to use the 1996 Agreement as evidence until after Kate testified, and because Ms. Maxwell disclosed the 1996 Agreement to the government as soon as she decided to use the agreement as evidence, there was no violation of Rule 16.\nThe government is doubly wrong to imply impropriety by saying that the defense \"made a point of confirming with Kate on cross examination specifically that the defendant lived on Kinnerton Street across from the Nags Head Pub—twice.\" Gov. Letter at 5 (citing TR 12/6/2021, pp 1235, 1253-54).
