Mr. Schoeman, how are you employed? A. I'm a lawyer at Kramer, Levin, Naftalis & Frankel. Q. You're a partner there? A. I am. Q. How long have you been practicing law? A. I graduated from law school in 1995. I first started at Kramer Levin in 2003. I left there in 2007 to return to the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of New York, and I returned back to Kramer Levin in the fall of 2009. Q. Were you a lawyer in this courtroom during the trial of David Parse and other defendants? A. I was. Q. Whom did you and your firm represent? A. We represented Raymond Craig Brubaker. Q. What other members -- what other partners, let's keep it simple, at your firm were involved in that trial? A. Barry Berke. My partner Barry Berke tried the case with me. Q. Let me direct your attention, if you would, to May 11, 2011, and ask you, did the Court that day, that afternoon, read aloud a note from Juror No. 1, Catherine Conrad? A. I believe that's the correct date if that is the date on SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00009420",
