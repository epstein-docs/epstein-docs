Third, do not let anyone talk to you about the case or about anyone who has anything to do with it. If any person should attempt to communicate with you about this case at any time throughout the trial, either in or out of the courthouse, you must immediately report that to my deputy, Ms. Williams, and to no one else. Ms. Williams will report it to me. And when I say report that communication to no one else, I mean you should not tell anyone, including your fellow jurors. To minimize the probability of any such improper communication, it is important that you go straight to the jury room when you come in in the morning, and that you remain in the jury room for the duration of the trial day. You should not linger in the public areas of the courthouse on this floor or elsewhere on your way in and out. Fourth, do not do any research or any investigation about the case or about anyone who has anything to do with the case on your own. Don't go visit any place described in the trial, don't read or listen to or watch any news reports about the case, don't go on the internet or use whatever digital or communications device it is you use to see what you can learn to inform yourself about this matter. Again, I know that in this day and age there is a temptation, but as I've made clear SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011687",
