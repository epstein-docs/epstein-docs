So if he says: I didn't expect the world to hear about my sexual abuse, yet at the same time he's telling Annie Farmer, one of the victims in this case, post-trial, \"Thanks for telling my story,\" that suggests to me that he wanted to be known as the victim of sexual abuse, he wanted to be seen as a champion of sexual abuse, and that this explanation that he is giving is simply false.\n2 There's also the Facebook post that he made after the fact --\n3 THE COURT: Just a moment. I will ask him to explain, to reconcile that if he can, that he said he didn't think people would know about it with the fact that he went on social media and thanked one of the witnesses in the case. I will ask about that.\n4 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, he said this is a verdict for all of the victims, which I think includes himself. How does he reconcile that comment with the fact that he didn't want to share with the world that he himself was a victim of sexual abuse, meaning: I'm doing this for the victims of sexual abuse. That's clear import of that comment. I think that's a conflict.\n5 There's also his Facebook posts after the fact where he says: I can now tell everybody that I was a juror on the Ghislaine Maxwell trial. What an incredible, surreal experience. Again, telling the world that I'm out here.\n6 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00010247",
