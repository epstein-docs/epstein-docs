What is it that you're going to do? What evidence are you going to --\n5 MR. PAGLIUCA: The lawyers are in proffers, your honor, and the witness is in the proffer. The witness can talk about what the lawyer said to the government in the proffer. The lawyers have emails to the government lawyers about what their clients will or won't say.
