  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 708 Filed 07/12/22 Page 10 of 15 514:2 - 11 3509-008, p. 7-8, overflow paragraph Jane was asked if she recalled any specific abuse that occurred in New Mexico and stated she was not sure. Same objection as the prior section. 514:1 - 515:7 3509-008, p. 8, 1st overflow paragraph The place was dark and she did not recall many details of this location. If there was abuse that occurred, it wouldn’t have been a group thing but she cannot recall anything specific. This is the same paragraph as the prior section. To the extent the defendant wants to impeach Jane about whether any abuse that occurred was not a “group thing,” that is consistent with her trial testimony. 515:8 - 516:10 3509-008, p. 11, top paragraph first sentence Jane was asked about the New Mexico trips she took and if she recalled any specific abuse that occurred there to which she answered she did not remember. Objection. The incident in New Mexico Jane described on direct is not inconsistent with prior statements that she does not recall “specific abuse” in New Mexico. 521:9 - 522-22 3509-001, p. 3, 2nd full paragraph In the beginning before the pool house incident, Epstein showed off to Jane…Epstein took Jane in a dark green car to Mar-a-lago to meet Donald Trump. Objection. Not inconsistent with the witness’s testimony. The witness agreed with most of this, and said she did not recall the timeline. Nor is it clear from the 3500 material that the events occurred before the pool house incident, as suggested on cross. 532:12 - 17 3509-001, p. 2, 2nd full paragraph Epstein, Maxwell, or an assistant would call Jane’s house phone. There was an assistant named Lesley, Maxwell’s assistant named Emmy Taylor, and another assistant named Michelle. Objection. Not inconsistent. The witness acknowledged the information contained in the 302. 10 DOJ-OGR-00011277",
