MOE: With respect to the sequence of events, just so victims are aware, would the Court prefer to hear from victims before the Court hears from the parties or after? We defer to the Court, but it would be helpful to know for the victims. THE COURT: I was anticipating government, victim statements, defense counsel and then Ms. Maxwell if she wishes to make a statement. My staff did provide counsel for the victims making statements an order in which they're speaking. MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. THE COURT: Any objection to that ordering, Ms. Moe? MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim? MS. STERNHEIM: I'm on now. No. Thank you. THE COURT: I'll see you at 1:00. Thank you.
