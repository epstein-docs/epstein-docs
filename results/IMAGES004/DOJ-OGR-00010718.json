  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 675-2 Filed 06/25/22 Page 4 of 5\n\nLast year, I travelled internationally to New York to attend Maxwell's trial. That was both therapeutic and traumatizing. It was therapeutic to hear the testimony of the four-brave victim-witnesses, whose experiences paralleled my own, to know that I was not alone and that our story was finally being told for the world to hear. But it was also traumatizing to relive the experience, and flashbacks and the nightmares have increased.\n\nI am grateful that the jury believed the victims and returned a guilty verdict. But a question still tears at my soul - After all of this, how can the manager of this enormous sex trafficking conspiracy involving so many co-conspirators that snared 100's if not 1,000s of vulnerable girls and young women over three decades continue to maintain her innocence? Who and what institution enabled this sex trafficking ring to continue. Why haven't the institutions and important people that enabled them been exposed and brought to justice? Reflecting on it, I know the answers to my questions.\n\nMaxwell is today the same woman I met almost 20 years ago - incapable of compassion or common human decency. Because of her wealth, social status, and connections, she believes herself beyond reproach and above the law. Sentencing her to the rest of her life in prison will not change her, but it will give other survivors and I a slight sense of justice and help us as we continue to work to recover from the sex-trafficking hell she perpetrated. She will never, ever hurt another young woman or child in this lifetime. For that, I am sure.\n\nAs for the important, high-profile enablers - governmental institutions, politicians, and very wealthy friends of Epstein/Maxwell here and abroad - so far their stature and power have protected them. I hope that one day they will be exposed, and we will be able to say that the United States truly is governed by the rule of law and not by powerful people.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010718",
