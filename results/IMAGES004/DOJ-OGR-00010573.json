Maxwell's victims trusted her: she was a seemingly respectable woman who showed interest in them and promised to help them. She was key to the entire operation of the scheme, and Epstein could not have committed these crimes without her.\nMaxwell befriended her victims, won their trust, slowly broke down their boundaries, and normalized sexual abuse.

The defendant was an adult, in her thirties, helping to normalize abusive sexual conduct with a young teenager.
