As expressed to Ms. Feldman by victims' attorneys and victims themselves, \"many victims were initially reluctant to participate in the EVCP - or would have refused to participate - without an express assurance of confidentiality.\"32\n\nAny intrusion on that promise would threaten the foundation of the program.
