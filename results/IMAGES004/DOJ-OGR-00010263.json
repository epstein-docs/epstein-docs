(Government counsel confer off the record) MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government would propose that we submit our letter briefing by Friday. MS. STERNHEIM: May I, Judge? THE COURT: Yes. I think your response on the other briefing is due on Friday. MS. STERNHEIM: And I am starting a trial, not that that is going to necessarily prolong our request. But I would ask for two weeks for us to submit our written submission. MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government respectfully submits that this issue has been prolonged in litigation. It has been briefed exhaustively. The only remaining issues are about Juror 50's testimony today and the inferences to be drawn, which is a very narrow and confined issue which can be resolved quickly and briefed quickly. MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, this is an incredibly important issue. We are not asking for -- THE COURT: I know it's incredibly important, Ms. Sternheim. That doesn't alter the fact of what there is to do.
