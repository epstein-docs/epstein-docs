However, if you have already shared the information publicly, including in media interviews, then I will not allow the sidebar. 6 There's a binder in front of you. I have marked the document in there as Court Exhibit 1, so it's Court Exhibit 1 to the record for this hearing proceeding and you may open that. 10 That is a copy of the questionnaire that you filled out on November 4, 2021. Please take a moment and look through it so that you're familiar with it and can identify it. 13 A. Yes. 14 Q. Do you recognize that as the questionnaire that you filled out on November 4, 2021, as part of the jury selection process in this case? 17 A. Yes, your Honor. 18 Q. I will ask you to turn to page 24 and look at question 48. 19 That question reads: Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse or sexual assault, and then in parenthesis, this includes actual or attempted assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher or family member. Do you see that question 48? 25 A. Yes, your Honor. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00010222",
