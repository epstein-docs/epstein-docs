It may seem like their personal truth, but, in fact, it is not the truth. You are going to hear stories from women who have absorbed many things, things they have heard and read, saw and said to others. And as the evidence will show and the expert testimony will show, these things can lead to memories that are untrustworthy, uncorroborated, and unreliable. Now, keep in mind the amount of time that has elapsed, the many versions of events that have been spun in the media, through talk, etc., and the incentive of personal monetary gain. All of these impact so-called memories into a retrospective interpretation that will be offered during this trial. Now, the four women that will testify were not initially interviewed by investigators experienced in the training of evaluating claims of sexual abuse. MS. COMEY: Objection. THE COURT: Sustained. The jury will disregard the last comment of Ms. Sternheim. MS. STERNHEIM: You are going to decide, when you hear these witnesses, if you find them reliable, credible, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011716",
