  "full_text": "through 42 will be in the main jury selection room and then 43 through, I believe 82 -- we will get the final number once we see what the return on the summons is -- will be seated in courtroom 9C also at 500 Pearl, with a live feed to 9C of everything taking place in the jury assembly room. I will make preliminary instructions which you have seen after you and I enter the courtroom. The panel members will be seated at that point. I will make my preliminary remarks, the written questionnaire that the jurors can read along with will be handed out at that point, both in the jury assembly room and in 9C simultaneously through court staff. I will instruct the jurors not to write anything on the questionnaire with the exception of circling a number if they have a \"yes\" response to that question as I read through the questionnaire. So, at that point I will turn to panel member juror no. 1 and go through and read the questionnaire getting \"yes\" or \"no\" response to each question. If the answer is \"yes\" following up as appropriate. To the extent that the matters touched upon could influence other jurors or are of a sensitive nature, we will bring that juror over to the plexiglass area to my right in the jury assembly room, there is markings on the floor where folks stand and the noise machine will be on so that others cannot hear, and I will inquire with the juror as to any necessary follow-up.
