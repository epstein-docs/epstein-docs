Paragraph 5 -- sorry -- did it again. 55, defendant makes three objections to the paragraph. I overrule the objections. The record supports that the defendant personally recruited Virginia to provide Epstein with sexualized massages when she was a minor. Jane and Kate's testimony established that the defendant was aware that the massages were sexualized. I credit Mr. Alessi's testimony that the defendant approached Virginia, and that Virginia visited the residence -- approached Virginia for the first time, and that Virginia visited the residence later that day.
