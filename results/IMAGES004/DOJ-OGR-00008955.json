Flight Records - Passenger Manifests and Shoppers Travel Records\n\nExactly when the accusers traveled across state lines and when the instances of illegal sexual activity took place were critical issues at trial. Not only were these dates relevant for the jury to assess the accuracy of the witness' recollections of events that had occurred over 20 years ago, but they were also important because the accusers needed to be younger than 17 years old for the sexual activity to be illegal under New York law. Contemporaneous flight records would have offered the best possible evidence to show exactly when accusers traveled. The only such records admitted at trial were the flight logs kept by David Rodgers, which were incomplete and often identified passengers simply by their first names or generic identifiers like \"1 female\" or \"1 male.\" Rodgers and Larry Visoski testified that the passenger manifests also contained information about the names of the passengers on the flights.
