The law provides that a defendant in a criminal case has an absolute right not to testify, and that a juror cannot hold it against the defendant if she chooses not to testify. Do you accept this principle, and will you be able to apply it if selected to serve on this jury?\nYes No\n12a. If no, please explain:\n\n13. A juror is required by law to make his or her decision based solely on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture, suspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice. Do you accept this principle, and will you be able to apply it if selected to serve on this jury?\nYes No\n13a. If no, please explain:\n\n14. Under the law, the question of punishment is for the Court alone to decide, and thus the issue of punishment must not enter into your deliberations as to whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty as charged.
