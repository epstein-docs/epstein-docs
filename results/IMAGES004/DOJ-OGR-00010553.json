The defendant reaches this low number by disputing four aspects of the Probation Office's calculation. For the reasons set forth below, the Court should reject the defendant's Guidelines objections in their entirety.

The 2004 Sentencing Guidelines Manual Applies\n\nIn the ordinary course, the Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts to use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced, which here would result in applying the 2021 Guidelines Manual (the \"2021 Manual\"). U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(a).

For example, under the 2021 Manual, the base offense level would be 30 before any enhancements are applied, whereas the 2004 Sentencing Guidelines Manual (the \"2004 Manual\") provides for a base offense level of 24 before enhancements. In other words, under the 2021 Manual, the offense level is at least six levels higher.
