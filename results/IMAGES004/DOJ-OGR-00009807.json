See Def. Ex. 1, Question 42. He also wrote that he did not have any views about laws concerning the age of consent or laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against minors that would affect his ability to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. 1, Questions 43-44. Juror 50 answered that he would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. 1, Question 47. Juror 50 checked the \"no\" box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member. See Def. Ex. 1, Question 48. He also checked the \"no\" box in response to the question of whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had ever been a victim of a crime. See Def. Ex. 1, Question 25.\n\nJuror 50 was one of the 231 prospective jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire. During voir dire, Juror 50 confirmed that he was able to follow the Court's instruction that the defendant is \"presumed innocent of all charges unless and until the government proves her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Nov. 16, 2021 Tr. at 128:15-19. In response to questioning by the Court about his knowledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 50 explained that he \"heard when Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,\" and reaffirmed that he was \"[a]bsolutely\" able to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follow the Court's instructions as to the law.
