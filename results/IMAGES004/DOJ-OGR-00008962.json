Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe annexed documents pertaining to Ghislaine Maxwell's motion for a new trial, previously submitted under seal, contain proposed redactions in conformance with the Court's Order (Dkt. 596).\nThe proposed redactions are intended to ensure the integrity of any fact-gathering process to uncover the truth surrounding Juror 50 's conduct during the voir dire process. Any inquiry will be focused primarily on the testimony of Juror 50. The proposed redactions reduce the risk that his testimony will be tailored based on a preview of information central to the inquiry or otherwise tainted by outside information and influence.\nThe proposed redactions pertain to the following information:\n- Juror 50's exact responses to the questions on his jury questionnaire, which is being kept temporarily under seal. See Dkt. 596 at 5, fn 1.\n- Data about the responses of other jurors and potential jurors to the jury questionnaire.\n- Details of investigative steps the defense has taken and evidence uncovered thus far.\n- The defense's view of the underlying facts.\n- The scope of the defense's requested discovery in advance of the hearing.\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.
