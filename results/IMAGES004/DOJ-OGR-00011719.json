Beyond that, I can't imagine a good-faith basis to proffer that evidence to come before this jury about that. MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, the government well knows that the lawyers for these people sat in their offices through proffer sessions. If nothing else, they are witnesses to what went on in that room. They also separately were in communication with the government providing information to the government; and the government, in turn, was helping them build their cases, their civil cases, and their cases for settlement. So there is a good-faith basis to raise these things. THE COURT: I had said clearly, since it's unclear, how you can call lawyers for witnesses in this case as witnesses themselves; that you wouldn't do so unless you briefed it specifically. You have not done that. So you may not refer to that testimony that you somehow anticipate getting in, although I don't know how you will in your opening. You may not. I was very clear that before that would happen, you would have to brief it. I haven't seen any briefing, so you may not reference it. MS. STERNHEIM: But, Judge, may I just say there's no dispute that if a witness to a proffer has information that may be a conflict with the testimony here, there is no privilege to that.
