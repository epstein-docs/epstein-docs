Loretta Preska in the Southern District of New York. Virginia Giuffre's (\"Ms. Giuffre\") lack of credibility, and actual conduct in recruiting young girls for Jeffrey Epstein, are critical issues in the above-mentioned litigation.\n\nWe write to notify you that Ms. Giuffre gave approximately nine hours of deposition testimony across the span of two days on April 13th and 14th, 2022, in Washington, D.C. Her lawyers have designated the entire transcript to date as confidential under the applicable protective order.\n\nOur efforts to have the transcripts unsealed and made public have been denied by Judge Preska. Also denied was our request to provide the transcript to your office so that you could determine, on an informed basis, whether it would be appropriate or ethical for you to allow Ms. Giuffre to give a victim impact statement during the sentencing phase of the Ghislaine Maxwell trial and therein vouch in that proceeding for her credibility.\n\nBoth the Court, and Ms. Giuffre's counsel, have made clear that they agree that we may notify you of the existence of the transcripts so that you can have the opportunity to review her testimony before she is allowed to provide a victim impact statement at the upcoming sentencing of Ghislaine Maxwell. We urge you, respectfully, to require her to produce it to you for your\n\nSDNY_GM_02775902\n\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010658",
