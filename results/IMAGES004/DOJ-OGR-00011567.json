As explained, I will use the\n3 2003 Guidelines manual. Following Section 2G1.1(d)(1), each\n4 victim is considered a separate count of conviction. In\n5 addition to the three victims for which an offense level was\n6 calculated in the PSR -- Jane, Annie, and Carolyn -- I\n7 calculate offense levels, for Virginia and Melissa, coming to a\n8 total of 5 groups.\n9\n10 For all groups, the base offense level is 19. That's\n11 Sections 2G1.1(a) and 2X1.1(a).\n12 For Jane and Carolyn, because they were older than 12\n13 but were not yet 16 when abuse began, the offense level is\n14 enhanced by 2. 2G1.1(b)(2)(B).\n15 The offense level for Jane and Carolyn is further\n16 enhanced by 2 because they were unduly influenced into a\n17 commercial sex act. 2G1.1(b)(4)(B).\n18 For Annie, Virginia, and Melissa, who were at least\n19 16, the offense level is increased by 2 because they were\n20 unduly influenced into a commercial act. 2G1.1.(b)(4)(B).\n21 The offense level for all groups are also enhanced by\n22 4 points because of the supervisory role in an extensive\n23 criminal activity. 3B1.1(a).\n24 This brings the total offense level for Jane's and\n25 Carolyn's groups to 27.
