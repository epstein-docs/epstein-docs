McCawley\nTelephone: (954) 356-0011\nEmail: smccawley@bsfllp.com\nJune 22, 2022\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nI am counsel for Juliette Bryant, and I am providing the following victim impact statement for the Court's consideration with respect to Maxwell's sentencing.\nPursuant to the Crimes Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Juliette Bryant qualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking from 2022 to 2004. Ms. Bryant was unable to leave her small child to travel from South Africa for the sentencing hearing and is therefore, unable to attend. Ms. Bryant therefore respectfully requests that the Court read her statement into the record or, alternatively, allow her attorney representative Sigrid McCawley to read the statement on her behalf.\nStatement by Juliette Bryant:\nSimply put, Ghislaine Maxwell is a monster. Ever since she and Jeffrey Epstein got their hands on me, I have never felt okay. Thinking about them still gives me frequent panic attacks and night terrors. All of the victims, including myself, are eternally grateful for everyone that has helped expose these criminals.\nI appreciate Your Honor imposing the maximum sentence available.\nRespectfully,\nSigrid S. McCawley\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n401 East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 1200, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301 | (t) 954 356 0011 | (f) 954 356 0022 | www.bsflp.com\nDOJ-OGR-00010676",
