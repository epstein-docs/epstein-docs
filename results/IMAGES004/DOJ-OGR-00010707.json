Maxwell's recent prosecution in this district followed the non-prosecution of her co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell, and other unknown co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida under highly unusual circumstances. As the Eleventh Circuit on banc recently stated, the facts involving the non-prosecution of Epstein, Maxwell, and other un-named and un-known co-conspirators in Florida \"are beyond scandalous—they tell a tale of national disgrace.\" In re Wild, 994 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2021), cert. denied sub nom.

But many questions remain about how and why the innumerable co-conspirators in an extensive international child sex trafficking operation have escaped justice for so long. In the Southern District of Florida, Epstein, Maxwell, and other co-conspirators arranged a secret non-prosecution deal that allowed Epstein to, in effect, take the fall for all involved and then to serve most of his prison time on \"work release\"—while the other co-conspirators (such as Maxwell) escaped prosecution entirely.
