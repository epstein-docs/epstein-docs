McCawley\nTelephone: (954) 356-0011\nEmail: smccawley@bsfllp.com\nJune 22, 2022\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nI am counsel for Teresa Helm, and I am providing the following victim impact statement for the Court's consideration with respect to Maxwell's sentencing.\nPursuant to the Crimes Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Teresa Helm qualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking in 2002. Ms. Helm thus requests the Court's permission to make an oral statement at the sentencing.\nStatement by Teresa Helm\nGhislaine Maxwell, I was 22 years old when you entirely derailed the trajectory of my life. You made a choice to view me as an individual less than you. You saw me as an object whose only purpose was to be manipulated, used, abused, regarded as trash, and sent back from where I came. You meticulously convinced me through your deceptive charm and conversation that you were someone worthy of my bright and inspired young mind to look up to. You crafted your impact on me. You groomed me. Then, you sent me off to another monster. I trusted you. You had groomed me so well, I unsuspectingly walked myself to the home of that monster. I walked myself to the home of that predator that hurt me. You manipulated and betrayed me into feeling and believing that I was safe.\nOne of the most devastating outcomes to you hurting me is how I then began to view and treat myself. I began to view myself as unworthy of love. I began treating myself as the garbage I was regarded as. My life got so dark, the despair so intense, I nearly did not make it out alive. Do you even remember me?\nI am on the outside of prison walls. Freedom. Yet, I will forever fight for the freedom that you callously stole from me.\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n401 East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 1200, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301 | (t) 954 356 0011 | (f) 954 356 0022 | www.bsflp.com\nDOJ-OGR-00010674",
