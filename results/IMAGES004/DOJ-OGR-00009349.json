Now we're back to the conversation on Foley Square?\n3 Q. I'm just asking a question, I'm not putting a date on it.\n4 MR. SCHECTMAN: Judge, it would be helpful if we had a\n5 date.\n6 Q. I don't know the answer so I'm going to ask the broad\n7 question.\n8 A. Okay.\n9 Q. At the time, around the time before the verdict came in --\n10 A. Okay, that's helpful.\n11 Q. Do you know whether Ms. Edelstein asked to see the\n12 suspension opinion?\n13 A. I don't think that she did, but I don't know one way or the\n14 other. She certainly didn't in the conversation on Foley\n15 Square that we've been talking about.\n16 Q. You do know, don't you, though, that on May 12th, Ms.\n17 Trzaskoma told not the Court about the suspension issue but\n18 Mr. Schoeman and Mr. Berke, correct?\n19 MR. SCHECTMAN: Judge, I object. I don't think the\n20 date is accurate. I think it's leading. I mean, I don't\n21 object to much leading, but the date's not accurate.\n22 MS. DAVIS: Your Honor if I might, 611(c) allows us to\n23 lead with a witness identified as an adverse party.\n24 THE COURT: He's not objecting to leading. He's\n25 objecting to leading with an erroneous assumption or statement\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00009349",
