I don't know if they were following the news of the case, but I have had some conversations about it with my friends afterward, but most people don't even know. It's not like -- I didn't know much about it either. Sexual abuse isn't a topic that I really want to research or learn about or watch about frequently. Q. You did understand from your interviews that the fact that you were abused would be a known fact in the world. A. Yes, your Honor. Q. And did you make a conscious decision that you were okay with that? A. Yes, your Honor. After sitting on this trial for several weeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their story, I felt like if they can do it, then so can I. I didn't have to divulge any of the details that happened to me, I focused on the memory aspect. Q. Okay. What I'm going to do now is I'm going to take us back in time to not November 4 but November 16, 2021. That's when I questioned you individually in that process that I suspect now you know is called voir dire. You recall that process? A. Yes, your Honor. Q. At that time I asked you some follow-up questions based on your responses to the questionnaire and some additional SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00010239",
