And their pleas included pleas to making false statements\n5 to the IRS, correct?\n6 A. That's true.\n7 Q. So it's not inconceivable that attorneys lie, correct?\n8 A. I don't think that's what I said, but it's certainly not\n9 inconceivable that lawyers lie.\n10 Q. And at the end of that conversation, you told Theresa\n11 Trzaskoma to leave it, correct?\n12 A. I don't remember the words, but something to that effect.\n13 Q. Now, she had been the partner in charge of the jury\n14 selection, correct, in terms of the detail work?\n15 A. I was in charge of the jury selection. But you're right,\n16 she was closer to it than I.\n17 Q. Did she tell you in that conversation that she had had\n18 basically an \"oh, Jesus\" moment?\n19 A. She certainly did not say that.\n20 Q. There was a possibility, Ms. Brune, that this was in fact\n21 true information. As you're standing there out in the plaza,\n22 that information existed, correct?\n23 A. I didn't believe that at the time.\n24 Q. Well, you didn't know, bottom line is you didn't know one\n25 way or the other, correct?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00010023",
