Absolutely not, your Honor.\n3 Q. In responding to the question, did you answer no so as to make it more likely that you would be selected for the jury?\n4 A. No, your Honor.\n5 Q. Did your history of sexual abuse motivate you, again, to try to tailor this answer to make it more likely that you would be selected for the jury?\n6 A. No, your Honor, I wasn't even thinking about that.\n7 Q. I am going to return to the topic of the process for filling out the questionnaire, and you have spoken to that some and I will give you as much space as you want to respond. Just by background, you were summoned to appear for jury duty on the morning of November 4, is that correct?\n8 A. Yes, your Honor.\n9 Q. And when did you learn you would be filling out a questionnaire?\n10 A. When we got to the courtroom.\n11 Q. When did you learn the case for which you were being considered as a juror?\n12 A. Three hours after sitting in that chair.\n13 Q. And how long did it take you to fill out the questionnaire?\n14 A. It's a great question. I don't recall how long it took, but I want to say we were done by around noon or a little after\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00010232",
