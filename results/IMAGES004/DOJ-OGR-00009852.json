There were names of several Palm Beach police officers listed on a first-name basis in that book, David said.\n\"Those girls' names and phone numbers were listed next to the words 'mom' and 'dad,'\" he said. \"Professional masseuses do not need their parents with them.\"\nMany speculated that the jury chose to acquit Maxwell on count two because that count related solely to Jane, and that Jane was less credible than other victims.\nBut David told The Independent that wasn't the case.\n\"We simply didn't see enough direct evidence to convict on count two,\" he said. \"It wasn't about not believing Jane.\"\nCount two was a substantive charge that required proof that Maxwell \"enticed\" Jane to travel across state lines. David said there just wasn't any direct evidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice Jane to get on those flights.\n\"I personally was willing to find her guilty on count two,\" he said. \"But we all decided in the end that there wasn't enough evidence.\"\nDavid also explained that he was convinced by the closeness of Maxwell and Epstein's relationship and the key role she played in his life.\nDOJ-OGR-00009852",
