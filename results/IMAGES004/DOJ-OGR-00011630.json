MOE: Your Honor, I think at a minimum we propose\n3 some additional follow-up guess for the juror about her role,\n4 whether she interfaces with folks dealing with compliance,\n5 which is within the scope of what this witness does, whether\n6 there would be any issues about hearing testimony about the\n7 financial institution where she works.\n8 We have not flagged for our witness that there is a\n9 juror, of course, who works with the institution, so it's hard\n10 for us to gauge whether they may have overlapped or whether\n11 they would recognize one another in the courtroom. So I\n12 recognize it would be difficult to probe this issue without\n13 creating an issue, but we think at a minimum a question about\n14 sort of her role and any issues about being fair or discomfort\n15 about witnesses who are testifying from the financial\n16 institution might address this issue.\n17 THE COURT: Who will I hear from?\n18 MS. STERNHEIM: You'll hear from me, Judge.\n19 I think it is a little late. The publicly available\n20 information would have revealed that there are other people who\n21 are in that same institution or have been affiliated with that\n22 institution, some of which were excused, and at least one that\n23 is still here. The government can exercise a challenge if it\n24 wishes. But I think it's unnecessary. And it flags something\n25 inappropriately at this stage of the game.
