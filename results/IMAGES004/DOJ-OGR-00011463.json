Oct. 19, 2018) (quashing subpoena seeking a \"forbearance agreement,\" citing Rule 408).\n\nThe documents Maxwell seeks here fit within the exclusionary provisions of Rule 408.51\n\nThe documents sought—submissions to the EVCP, including claim forms; communications between the EVCP and the victims or their attorneys; records of payments; and releases—constitute evidence of either \"furnishing, promising, or offering—or accepting, promising to accept, or offering to accept—a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise the claim,\" Fed.

R. Evid. 1101(b) (rules of evidence apply in criminal proceedings). And the Second Circuit has since addressed the substance of a Rule 408 argument on a criminal appeal, without reference to Manko or to any possibility that Rule 408 was inapplicable in criminal cases.
