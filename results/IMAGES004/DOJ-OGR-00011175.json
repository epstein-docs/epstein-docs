The \"standard for authentication is one of 'reasonable likelihood' and is 'minimal.'

Tan Yat Chin, 371 F.3d 31, 38 (2d Cir. 2004) (emphases in original).\n\nII. Government Exhibit 52\n\nThe Court has received extensive briefing on Government Exhibit 52, the defendant's contact book. (See Dkt. Nos. 390, 397, 398, 457, 490, 491). To summarize, the Government's argument for authentication has to date relied on the testimony of a former employee (\"Employee-1\") of Epstein's who worked for him in [REDACTED] along with a household manual that corroborates that multiple copies of the contact book existed. (See Dkt. No. 457, 491). The defense challenges that authentication because Employee-1 cannot state that she has previously seen the particular contact book that is Government Exhibit 52—although she does recognize it as one of a set of the defendant's contact books in that house when she worked at Epstein's Palm Beach house [REDACTED]. The Court has reserved judgment on this issue until Employee-1 testifies at trial. (11/23/21 Tr. at 16).1\n\n1 To be clear, the Government continues to believe that Employee-1 can authenticate Government Exhibit 52, but respectfully submits that the following is an independent basis for admission.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-00011175",
