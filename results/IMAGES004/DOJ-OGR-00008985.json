Juror 50 further desires to maintain his privacy and, to the extent possible, avoid having to disclose intimate details of his experience as the victim of prior sexual assault.\nIII. ARGUMENT\nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court should, in its proper exercise of discretion, allow Juror 50 to intervene in this action and grant release, under seal, of a copy of his Jury Questionnaire to his attorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\nThe relevant precedent from case law makes it abundantly clear that jurors have compelling and legitimate rights to privacy regarding “intensely personal subjects,” including prior sexual assaults. Juror 50’s right to privacy is clearly implicated by an inquiry by and before this Court, as the same relates directly and specifically claims concerning his experience(s) as a survivor of past sexual abuse and discussions he may have had with other jurors, in which he is alleged to have detailed his history as a victim of prior sexual assault.
