Are you shying away from using the word \"investigate\" to\n4 describe what it was that you and Mr. Benhamou and Mr. Kim and\n5 Ms. Stapp were doing on the morning of May 12th?\n6 A. It's not that I'm shying away. I just don't think it is\n7 accurate. To me \"investigation\" means more than looking at a\n8 database search. What I think of as an investigation is what\n9 we ended up doing once we received the jury letter.\n10 Q. You also stated in your memorandum at page 32 note 13 that\n11 the defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad was lying\n12 in response to the Court's questions. That is just wrong, Ms.\n13 Brune.\n14 A. I have I think already said that having reflected on all\n15 this, I think there are a number of things that I wish had been\n16 said differently. What I was trying to convey to the Court in\n17 the brief was the reality, which is that we didn't think it was\n18 the same person and we were shocked when we received the note\n19 and found out about the phone number matching.\n20 Q. Had you seen the email traffic at that point in time when\n21 you filed the brief, Ms. Brune?\n22 A. No, I had not.\n23 Q. But you know now that Ms. Trzaskoma knew about that email\n24 traffic, correct?\n25 A. She did.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00010034",
