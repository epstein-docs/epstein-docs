Barnes, 604 F.2d 121, 139 (2d Cir. 1979) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \"A juror's dishonesty during voir dire undermines a defendant's right to a fair trial.\" Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 468; U.S. Const. amend. VI.\n\"[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror's voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\" United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 303 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\nA defendant need not demonstrate prejudice when a juror gives a false answer to a material question during voir dire if the juror would have been subject to a challenge for cause if he had answered honestly. See United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304, 316 (2000) (the \"seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause\" \"would require reversal\"). When a biased juror deliberates on a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required without a showing of actual prejudice. See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 307-10 (1991).\nB. An intentionally false answer during voir dire is not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial.\n\"Intentionally false\" juror answers are not a prerequisite to a finding that a defendant's constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury have been violated. McDonough, 464 U.S. at 553-56; id. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-59 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).
