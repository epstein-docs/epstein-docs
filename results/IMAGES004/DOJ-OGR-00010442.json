Apart from Virginia Roberts initially offering Carolyn the opportunity to massage Epstein, the record indicates that Carolyn sought out additional massage appointments herself and recruited other minors to perform sexualized massages to make more money. (Tr. 1527-28, 1543-46). Carolyn further testified that after she became pregnant, she returned to Epstein without being contacted to earn additional money. (Tr. 1548-49). In addition, Carolyn was not so influenced by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell that she did whatever they asked of her.
