Did she tell you that she had viewed a Westlaw report that\n3 had certain information on it that was connected to Juror No.\n4 1, Catherine Conrad?\n5 A. No.\n6 Q. Did she tell you that she had communicated with somebody\n7 internally in her firm where she had exclaimed, \"Jesus, I think\n8 Juror No. 1 is the suspended attorney\"?\n9 A. No.\n10 Q. If you had that information from Theresa Trzaskoma, would\n11 you have done further investigation yourself?\n12 A. I don't know.\n13 Q. How many years did you spend as an Assistant U.S. Attorney,\n14 Mr. Schoeman?\n15 A. A total of about seven or eight.\n16 Q. I would stipulate to the fact, because I've heard it, that\n17 you were a terrific investigator, correct?\n18 A. I'll stipulate with you.\n19 Q. Are you telling us really that you wouldn't have looked\n20 into that further yourself if you had seen these further\n21 connections tying Juror No. 1 to the suspended attorney?\n22 A. Forgive me. I thought your question was if I had heard\n23 that she had written an email that had that exclamation. I\n24 don't know what I would have done.
