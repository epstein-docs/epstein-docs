I wanted as much information as we were able to get\n3 about every prospective juror.\n4 Q. Now, you understood that the voir dire process would be the\n5 judge asking the questions of the potential jurors, correct?\n6 A. I did, but I also understood that the Court would likely\n7 ask other questions if we proposed them.\n8 Q. So you understood that you could request of Judge Pauley to\n9 further inquire?\n10 A. Yes.\n11 Q. And you also understood that sometimes jurors don't give a\n12 full picture when they're giving the answers in response to\n13 voir dire questions, correct?\n14 A. Yes. I certainly think that it's something that's within\n15 the realm of possibility that a juror might not be complete.\n16 Q. And it's also possible, would you agree, during voir dire,\n17 that you could ask the judge to inquire about a completely new\n18 area if it occurs to you as the questioning is going on,\n19 correct?\n20 A. Sure.\n21 Q. And it was the Court's decision, would you agree, whether or\n22 not to ask any particular question.\n23 A. Of course.\n24 Q. It's not a decision that rests with you or the other\n25 defense counsel, correct?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
