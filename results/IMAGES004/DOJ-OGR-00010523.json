  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 663 Filed 06/15/22 Page 77 of 77 Forensic-Psychiatric Report Ghislaine Maxwell Ms. Maxwell's ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate meaningfully in her defense are gradually being eroded over time due to the conditions of her confinement, as reported by Ms. Maxwell, observed by this examiner, and corroborated by Ms. Saffian and in the results of her psychological testing. Recently she has manifested symptoms of depression and trauma such as anxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These continue to be exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation and the conditions of her confinement. Given my extensive experience working with incarcerated individuals, based on the manner in which Ms. Maxwell's symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are in no way related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are directly related to the conditions of her confinement. The conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her increasing depression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions. If she were permitted to be released into the community, her symptoms would likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the opportunity to properly prepare her defense for trial. At this time, Ms. Maxwell currently poses little to no risk to the community, as she has no prior history of criminal or violent behavior and her current charges could only have been manifest under a very specific set of circumstances which she cannot find herself in if she were to be released. Additionally, in my psychiatric opinion, she is not a flight risk, as she has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her, despite any psychiatric symptoms that have manifested. Ms. Maxwell has the personality characteristics of a fighter, she has demonstrated a firm resolve to fight her current charges and clear her name. There is no indication that she would attempt to flee given her personality profile.
