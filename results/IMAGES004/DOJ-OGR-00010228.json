But now you say yes because it would have been a stepbrother. Explain.\n4 A. Because by law, by marriage, that person was my stepbrother. So when you read the question that way and it\n5 says has a friend or family member ever been accused, then the correct answer would have been yes, a friend or family member.\n6 Q. Okay. And so the same response then for 48A is what you would have given for 49B?\n7 A. Yes, your Honor.\n8 Q. And 49B, if your answer to 49 was yes, do you believe this would affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a\n9 juror in this case?\n10 A. In no case. It would not affect me.\n11 Q. In responding a moment ago you said you never thought you would be chosen as a juror in this case. Why is that?\n12 A. Only because the sheer volume of people that were there. It was insane, the amount of people. So I just never\n13 thought -- number one, I didn't know what it was when I went into it, and then when they played the video of you, I just\n14 thought that the likelihood of being chosen, surely they will be interviewing thousands of people. And they ultimately\n15 choose twelve people to sit on a jury, and I never thought I would be one of those twelve.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00010228",
