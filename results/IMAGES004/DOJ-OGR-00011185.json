In any event, the Government made that both explicit and highly specific in the November 26 letter, three days after the defendant expressed concerns about notice. The November 26 letter identifies the precise exhibits about which Flatley will testify, including the exhibits that display metadata fields (which were produced on October 11, 2021), and it provides detail about the methods and metadata about which he will testify. The sufficiency of the Government's notice is evidenced by the fact that the defendant noticed a rebuttal expert on November 1, 2021, and they likewise have had ample time to prepare any cross-examination on metadata. Thus, to the extent the Court has any doubt as to whether Flatley's testimony constitutes expert opinion, the Government would seek to qualify him as an expert on the relevant subjects.\nSecond, the remainder of Flatley's expected testimony stated in the November 26 letter is clearly fact testimony. As the letter explains, Flatley will testify that he examined Government Exhibits 54 and 55 and determined that particular other Government exhibits were stored there. (Ex. A at 2).
