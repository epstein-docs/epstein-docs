I asked you whether you approached filling out the questionnaire with diligence.\nCan you recall that?\nA. Yes, your Honor.\nQ. And you indicated no and you wish you had and that sort of thing. And I asked you whether you took my instructions carefully in the questionnaire.\nDo you remember that?\nA. Yes, your Honor.\nQ. And your answer is no? Is that accurate?\nA. Yes, your Honor.\nQ. And to make sure I understand, why is that? Why didn't you take my instructions carefully?\nA. It was definitely inadvertent. Again, like I said, I began to float, fly through it, in order to get done. I was super distracted, and it just -- I don't know what happened. I just wanted to get done with it.\nQ. When you came back on November 16 for the follow-up questions, there was another instruction video.\nDo you recall that?\nA. Yes, your Honor.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00010255",
