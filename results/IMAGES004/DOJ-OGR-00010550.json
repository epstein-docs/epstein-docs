At some point during each massage, Epstein rolled over and began masturbating himself. (Id.). Epstein then directed Carolyn to touch his nipples and he touched Carolyn's breasts and buttocks. (Id.). On one occasion, Epstein attempted to touch Carolyn's vagina with a vibrator, but Carolyn pulled away, so he stopped. (Id.). On two occasions, Epstein brought other females into the room with Carolyn, who engaged Carolyn in oral sex, and on one occasion Epstein raped Carolyn by penetrating her vagina with his penis. (PSR ¶ 72). Every massage ended with Epstein ejaculating. (PSR ¶ 64).\nThe defendant personally scheduled Carolyn's massages for approximately the first year or two, when Carolyn was between the ages of 14 and 15. (PSR ¶ 66). When the defendant scheduled Carolyn for an appointment, she sometimes sent a car to pick Carolyn up. (Id.). At the time, Carolyn was 14 or 15 years old and did not have a license. (Id.). Indeed, the defendant knew Carolyn's age and much of her background because she had multiple conversations with Carolyn about Carolyn's life. (PSR ¶ 67). During these conversations, Carolyn revealed that she had previously been sexually abused by a relative, that her parents were separated, and that her mother struggled with addiction. (Id.). The defendant invited Carolyn to travel with the defendant and Epstein, but Carolyn explained that because she was only 14 years old, she would not be able to get permission to travel. (PSR ¶ 68). Carolyn was paid several hundred dollars in one-hundred-dollar bills after each massage. (PSR ¶ 65). Usually, the money was laid out on the table or by the sink in the bathroom, but the defendant personally paid Carolyn after a few massages. (Id.). The defendant saw Carolyn fully nude in the massage room on approximately three occasions. (PSR ¶ 69). This happened when Carolyn had already undressed in preparation for the massage but before Epstein had come into the room. (Id.). One particular instance stands out in Carolyn's mind. (Id.).
