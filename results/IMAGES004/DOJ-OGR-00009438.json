ROTERT: We do not, your Honor.\n7 MR. SKLARSKY: No, your Honor.\n8 THE COURT: Does the government have anything further?\n9 MR. OKULA: Thank you, your Honor. We do not.\n10 THE COURT: The government rests?\n11 MR. OKULA: We do indeed, your Honor.\n12 THE COURT: I would like to get some post-hearing\n13 briefing from the parties. It seems to me that the simplest\n14 way to do it would be to have the parties submit simultaneous\n15 briefs and then I give you a very short responsive brief if you\n16 felt it was necessary to respond to something that the other\n17 side said.
