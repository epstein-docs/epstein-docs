The question was that you were willing to provide a 2 complete and accurate set of facts if and only if the 3 government asked, is that what you are saying? 4 A. No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I tried very hard 5 to be accurate in the brief that we submitted. It has the 6 shortcomings that we have talked about. 7 Q. It has material omissions, Ms. Brune? 8 A. I certainly have tried to be accurate. 9 Q. It has material omissions, correct? 10 A. I do not believe that it was written with the goal of 11 making a material omission. I believed then and believe now 12 that the standard is actual knowledge. We did not have actual 13 knowledge or anything near that. We were shocked when we 14 received the letter. 15 Q. It has material omissions in it? 16 MR. SHECTMAN: Asked and answered. 17 MR.
