The person that I have known for 34 years, is not the same as the Ghislaine so negatively portrayed by the press and mainstream media. My own experience is that she is kind, caring and thoughtful and is always there to provide support as a loyal and generous friend. She has been a mentor, encouraging and helping me to develop my business and gives her time and advice freely. Since her arrest I have written to her and plan to visit her once my application is approved Respectfully, Catherine Vaughan-Edwards",
