In fact, she has been involved in two committed, long-term, loving relationships with men who had young children. She is not a danger to the community and there is no concern about recidivism.\nIn imposing an appropriate sentence, we urge the Court to credit a number of factors:\n- Ms. Maxwell is being sentenced for non-violent offenses which occurred decades ago (1994 to 2004).\n- Ms. Maxwell is over 60 years old.\n- Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community in any way.\n- Ms. Maxwell has no prior criminal history or prior bad acts.\n- Ms. Maxwell has served the entirety of pre-sentence detention during the COVID pandemic.\n- Ms. Maxwell served 22 months of pre-sentence detention under extraordinarily abnormal and restrictive conditions of solitary confinement as a non-violent defendant who posed no danger to herself or others.\n- Ms. Maxwell is being sentenced solely for reasons of punishment.\n- Ms. Maxwell is not being sentenced for rehabilitation.\n- Ms. Maxwell poses no risk of recidivism.\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell's personal characteristics and history of lawful behavior pre- and and post-dating the offense conduct further distinguishes her situation and warrants sentencing consideration.\nProbation recognizes that a downward variance is warranted in this case. However, noticeably absent from Probation's justification is any mention of detention served during the pandemic and under harsh conditions of solitary confinement.
