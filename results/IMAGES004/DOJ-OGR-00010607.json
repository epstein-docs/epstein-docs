What happened to me at that young age changed the course of my life drastically, forever.\n\nSpeaking out about what happened to me opened me up to much criticism and forced me to relive parts of my story that I would have preferred to have done privately, in the safety of trusted individuals.\n\nTestifying in this trial was both terrifying and retraumatizing.\n\nI do not, however, regret it for one moment. There is nothing more important than protecting the innocent and, if I was able to provide, in any way, information helpful to understanding the nature of this type of abuse, as perpetrated by Ghislaine Maxwell, then my pain has had meaning and therefore not been for naught.\n\nI remain in deepest gratitude to the other women who came forward and to those who, for whatever reason, didn't or couldn't.\n\nI remain in deepest gratitude to the prosecutors who worked tirelessly to bring Ghislaine Maxwell to justice, to protect the women who testified and to expose the grotesque malice with which these crimes were committed.\n\nI remain in deepest gratitude to the people of the jury, who gave up their time and energy, to be part of this great judicial system, that saw a fair trial was executed.\n\nI remain in deepest gratitude to Judge Nathan, for presiding so cautiously, fairly, and deliberately.\n\nI remain in deepest gratitude to my partner, friends and family, who tirelessly supported me through this unnatural and traumatic time.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-00010607",
