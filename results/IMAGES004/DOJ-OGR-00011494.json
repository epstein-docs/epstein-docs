If there is sufficient information in the Registration Form to allow the Program to evaluate the registration, the Program will notify the registrant whether s/he is eligible to participate in the Program within that 45-day time period. If key information in the Registration Form is missing or insufficient, the Program will contact the registrant within that 45-day time period and allow the registrant to provide additional information. If additional, sufficient information is not submitted within 30 days of Program outreach, the Registration may be denied.\n\n**Note: The fact that you are sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates that the Administrator has determined only that you are eligible to participate in the Program. It does not indicate that the Administrator has determined that you are eligible to receive compensation. That determination is made only after you submit the Claim Form and all required documentation, and that information is evaluated by the Administrator.\n\n3. Is there a deadline to file or register a claim?\n\nYes. The deadline to file a claim is March 25, 2021 (\"Filing Deadline\") which is nine (9) months after the Effective Date of June 25, 2020. All individual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\n\nThe deadline to register a claim is February 8, 2021 (\"Registration Deadline\").
