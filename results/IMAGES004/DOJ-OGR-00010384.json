Jane testified that Epstein first engaged in sexual activity with her in Palm Beach when she was fourteen years old. Trial Tr. at 305. She then began traveling from Palm Beach to New York with the Defendant and Epstein at that same age. Id. at 315–16. Jane explained that she traveled on commercial flights and Epstein’s private jet. Id. at 316. She testified that the Defendant also traveled on some of these flights, and that the Defendant assisted her in making her travel arrangements to New York. Id. at 316–17.
