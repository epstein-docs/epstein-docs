If that wasn't something that truly entered your head, isn't it a fact that you spoke to Lucia, the reporter from The Independent that you spoke to, about the consequences that you might face in revealing all this stuff -- we won't get into jury deliberations -- about what you said to her about your sexual abuse and other things, there would be well-known consequences to what you were doing. How do you square those two thoughts in your head, which you didn't think it would be public, didn't think you would be known for this, and the journalist is telling you that very fact? MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government has no objection to limited follow-up questions about his understanding about whether it would become public.
