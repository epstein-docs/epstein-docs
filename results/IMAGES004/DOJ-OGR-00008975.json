Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe annexed documents, previously submitted under seal, contain proposed redactions in conformance with the Court's Orders (Dkt. 596, 605).1\nThe proposed redactions are intended to ensure the integrity of the fact-finding process to uncover the truth surrounding Juror 50's conduct during the voir dire process, to ensure juror anonymity and privacy, and to preserve specific factual information developed by the defense that has not been publicly reported and that the defense proposes to inquire about at any forthcoming hearing.\nIn an abundance of caution, we have proposed redactions to information and data about the responses of other jurors (selected and prospective) to the jury questionnaire because the questionnaires and sealed portions of the voir dire transcript are not part of the public record. The public disclosure of juror information, even if provided anonymously, risks compromising the integrity of the jury selection process and the willingness of potential jurors to disclose personal information.\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM\nAttachments\ncc: Counsel of Record\n1 The documents - Ghislaine Maxwell's Motion for a New Trial, the Government's Opposition, and Ms. Maxwell's Reply - will remain under seal pending the Court's decision regarding the proposed redactions.\nDOJ-OGR-00008975",
