  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 737 Filed 07/22/22 Page 89 of 101 89 M6s2Max2 the appropriate sentence in this case in light of the 3553(a) factors and the appropriate purposes of sentencing as reflected in that statute. The crimes for which I sentence Ms. Maxwell today are the crimes for which a jury convicted her of committing following trial. I do want to emphasize that today the sentence is based entirely on those crimes and the harm done to the victims of those charged and proved crimes. The evidence at trial established that Ms. Maxwell directed and repeatedly and over the course of many years participated in a horrific scheme to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls, some as young as 14, for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein. I will pause on those words for a moment, \"by and with Epstein.\" It is important at the outset to emphasize that although Epstein was, of course, central to this criminal scheme, Ms. Maxwell is not being punished in place of Epstein or as a proxy for Epstein. Like every other participant in a multi-defendant case, Ms. Maxwell is being punished for the role that she played in the criminal conduct. As to that role, the trial evidence established that Ms. Maxwell was instrumental in the abuse of several underage girls and that she herself participated in some of the abuse, and it is her conduct for which she has been convicted in the court under the laws of this country and it is her conduct for which she must be held accountable.
