McCawley\nTelephone: (954) 356-0011\nEmail: smccawley@bsfllp.com\nJune 22, 2022\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nI am counsel for Maria Farmer, and I am providing the following victim impact statement for the Court's consideration with respect to Maxwell's sentencing.\nPursuant to the Crimes Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Maria Farmer qualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking in 1996. Due to a medical issue, Ms. Farmer is unable to attend the sentencing in person, therefore she respectfully requests that the Court read her statement into the record or, alternatively, allow her attorney representative Sigrid McCawley to read the statement on her behalf.\nStatement by Maria Farmer:\nMy life was on a trajectory to be a well-known and well-respected artist when I was derailed by Ghislaine Maxwell. I was studying with the phenomenal artists Eric Fischl and Chuck Close, while doing art for Director James Brooks when I was held captive and assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell on the Wexner estate in 1996. I was freshly graduated from a Masters program in Art—something I worked towards all of my life. Ghislaine began threatening my life and destroying my livelihood following my return from being falsely imprisoned at Wexner's.\nShe wasn't happy just destroying my career, she also assured me my future was destroyed and she did everything in her vast power to accomplish this goal. She threatened my family and friends.\nI have severe PTSD and two cancers as a result of my forced solitude, poverty, and quality of life while in hiding.\nThe shame I associated with my art following Ghislaine's abuse was overwhelming. I stopped painting. The thing is, this was never my shame to carry. I was a figurative artist doing what artists do, paint. The beholders of my art, Epstein and Maxwell, perverted it into what they\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n401 East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 1200, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301 | (t) 954 356 0011 | (f) 954 356 0022 | www.bsfflp.com\nDOJ-OGR-00010672",
