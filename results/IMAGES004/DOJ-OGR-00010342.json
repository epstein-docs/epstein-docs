No. 649.\nJuror 50 certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court's questions, but that is consistent with what any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 50 would have reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for anticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 50's responses any fabrication or improper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf. Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App'x 10, 12 (2d Cir. 2020) (summary order) (declining to discount a witness's testimony as \"rehearsed\" where that witness did \"what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially life-altering hearing\"). As for being \"self-serving,\" as noted above, Juror 50's personal interests were served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 50 \"did not see the word 'you' and the answer 'Yes (self)'\" for Question 48.
