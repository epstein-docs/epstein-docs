  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 734-5 Filed 07/15/22 Page 12 of 17\n\nOn page 9 of the Claim Form, you must indicate which option you choose under the \"Proof of Legal Representation/Legal Authority to Act on Claimant's Behalf\" section, and when you upload the claim, this documentation must be included in order to initiate the processing of the claim. If you choose to draft a statement for your clients, please ensure that both the attorney and adult Claimant sign that statement. This requirement is in addition to the Claimant's initials on page 10.\n\n14. Do I need an attorney to file a claim with the Program?\n\nNo, you do not need an attorney to file a claim with the Program. All claimants and claims are treated with the same care, diligence, analysis and attention regardless of whether or not the claimant is represented by an attorney. The Program conducts proactive outreach with all unrepresented Claimants to ensure that they are fully informed of the Program's policies and procedures, and to answer any questions they may have.\n\n15. Can I add an attorney or change the attorney associated with my claim?\n\nYes. You may add an attorney or change your attorney at any time by submitting a Change of Attorney form. Claimants should be aware, however, that they are liable for any agreement related to attorneys' fees as specified in any prior attorney-client contract.\n\n16. Will filing a claim cost money?\n\nNo. There is no fee associated with filing a claim with the Program. You may, however, incur fees from professionals such as lawyers, should you choose to engage their services. The Program will not pay for or reimburse you for such fees.\n\n17. Obtaining notarized documents is difficult (due to Claimant location or COVID-19 restrictions). Are there any exceptions or alternatives allowed? (added June 29, 2020)\n\nWe understand that, in some countries, notarizing a form can be costly or otherwise prohibitive. For that reason, for individuals living in other countries, we will accept notarization by a notarizing officer at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate or an equivalent alternative document authentication mechanism acceptable in that country. For Claimants having difficulty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most states have enacted statutes or Executive Orders to allow alternatives, such as via video conference or fax. The Program will accept any form of notarization that is acceptable by law in the state in which the form is notarized.\n\n11 | Page\nDOJ-OGR-00011498",
