  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 663 Filed 06/15/22 Page 25 of 77\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell was kept in isolation, she was denied the minimal amenities provided to general population inmates even during COVID. Except for programs that she completed but could never put to use in isolation, she was not permitted to participate in general programming (educational, leisure and wellness), to view movies, or to receive job assignment. When she first arrived in the MDC, she was handcuffed while seated in a chair watching television. During the first three months of detention, she was only allowed two 15-minute phone calls per month, further limiting contact with her family, most especially with her husband and stepchildren. This is the same restriction that was applied in MCC's 10 South, the super-secure special/segregated housing unit (\"SHU\") for inmates charged with terrorism offenses. A further chill was placed on her phone use when recordings of her calls were improperly released by the MDC to a third party. To forestall further disruption of the privacy of her family, she curtailed social use of the phone, further limiting contact with the outside. Ms. Maxwell was denied adequate nutrition. She was provided meager, stale, often rancid and inedible meals in violation of her non-flesh diet and in packaging that melted when heated in a microwave. At times she was not provided food for prolonged periods or was given meals missing components. She was denied access to basic hygiene items, e.g., soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, and provided only a limited amount of toilet paper. For more than a year, she brushed her teeth with an inch-long finger implement until given a normal toothbrush, that was never replaced. Her commissary list was restricted, and she was not permitted to order items available to other inmates.15 When the tap water in her isolation cell was foul-smelling and undrinkable, requests for bottled water were initially rejected by the prison administration. As a result of being provided an inadequate diet, Ms. Maxwell has lost about 20 pounds and suffered from telogen effluvium.15 Even in general population, her commissary is more restricted than other inmates. A unit officer confirmed that commissary operates on favoritism and discrimination.",
