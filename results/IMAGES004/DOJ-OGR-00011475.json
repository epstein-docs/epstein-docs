The Epstein VCP is a voluntary, non-adversarial, confidential claims resolution program that has been established to compensate victims-survivors and resolve their sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently of the Epstein Estate.\n\nThe Program was designed over the last several months by nationally recognized independent claims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana (\"Jordy\") H. Feldman (\"Co-Designers\") with input from attorneys representing over 70 victims, the Attorney General of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Program will be administered by Ms. Feldman (the \"Administrator\"), the former Deputy Special Master of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the litigation-alternative program administered by the U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who have become sick or died as a result of their September 11th-related exposure.\n\n\"This Program provides victims of Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity to be heard outside the glare of public courtroom proceedings, and to receive acknowledgment by an independent third party as to the legitimacy of their experience and the long-term suffering it has wrought,\" said Ms. Feldman. \"Treating victims with dignity and respect and providing them with appropriate compensation is central to our work with the Program, even as we recognize that no amount of money will erase the years of pain these victims have endured.\"\n\n\"These programs are as much about offering validation as providing fair compensation,\" said Mr. Feinberg who, along with Ms. Biros, has designed and administered similar compensation programs for the Catholic Church sexual abuse claims, the Penn State sexual abuse claims, and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, among others.\n\nThe Program provides victims with an attractive alternative to litigation by offering a process that is speedy and cost-effective. The Program also removes barriers to pursue claims in civil courts,\n\nDOJ-OGR-00011475",
