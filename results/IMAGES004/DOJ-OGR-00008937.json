Moreover, \"although an indictment 'drawn in general terms' may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific terms may be read to specify a narrower set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct facts at trial could lead to a constructive amendment.\" Id.

For example, specific overt acts alleged in the indictment may narrow the scope of the core of criminality because they \"effect the object of the [charged] conspiracy.\" United States v. Attanasio, 870 F.2d 809, 816-17 (2d Cir. 1989) (citation omitted). By contrast, general factual allegations in an indictment that are not part of the specific statutory allegations of a particular count may not limit the core of criminality of that offense. Id.
