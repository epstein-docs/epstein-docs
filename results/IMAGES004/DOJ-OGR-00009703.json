  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 642 Filed 03/11/22 Page 11 of 66\n\nasked potential jurors if they would have any difficulty assessing the credibility of\nalleged victims of sexual assault or abuse just as they would assess the credibility of any other witness.\n\nPrior to finalizing the questionnaire, Ms. Maxwell proposed specific questions to identify potential jurors who had been victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment. The defense proposed to ask potential jurors: (1) \"Whether reported or not, have you, any family member or anyone close to you, including a child/minor, ever been the victim of any form of sexual abuse? (This includes actual or attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member;\" and (2) \"Whether reported or not, have you, or anyone close to you, including a child/minor, ever felt in danger of being sexually assaulted by another person, including a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member?\" Doc. 367, p 21. The government objected to Ms. Maxwell's proposed questions. Id. The Court partially agreed with the prosecution, asking a single question about whether potential jurors had been actual victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment.\n\nSpecifically, Question 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nThe questionnaire offered three answers: \"Yes (self),\" \"Yes (friend or family member),\" and \"No.\"\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-00009703",
