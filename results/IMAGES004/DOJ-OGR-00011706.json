If you do those three things, you will reach the only verdict that is consistent with the evidence, the law, and your common sense, that Ghislaine Maxwell is guilty. THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Pomerantz. Members of the jury, we'll now hear opening statements on behalf of the defendant and we'll hear from Ms. Sternheim. MS. STERNHEIM: Ever since Eve was tempting Adam with the apple, women have been blamed for the bad behavior of men, and women are often villainized and punished more than the men ever are.

You will hear plenty of testimony, some of which the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011706",
