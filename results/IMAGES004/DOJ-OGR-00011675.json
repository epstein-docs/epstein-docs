We just did want to raise that concern about being able\n3 to follow along. We also wanted to ask --\n4 THE COURT: And I fully agree with you.\n5 And that's why I said we'll give it a shot. They have\n6 to be extremely mindful that anything that they're doing or\n7 showing the witness has to be fully described on the record and\n8 so the government can follow. And if that doesn't work for\n9 some reason or I think it's not particularly aiding the review\n10 of the evidence, then we'll just do it the old-fashioned way\n11 with paper.\n12 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.\n13 And finally, we just wanted to know where -- where the\n14 screen would be located that those items would be projected to\n15 the witness from. So, for example, our paralegal is sitting in\n16 the gallery and has a screen there; so we're being careful\n17 about what's on her screen to avoid the public seeing that. We\n18 just wanted to know where the screen would be in the courtroom\n19 that that's being projected from so we can be mindful of that\n20 concern.\n21 THE COURT: Good question.\n22 MS.
