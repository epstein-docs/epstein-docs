So she does not need many more months, or certainly years, to pay for whatever crimes the verdict says she committed and aim for rehabilitation.\n\nYou will surely sentence her in a just manner. I assure you that upon her release, under probation and beyond, just as she never committed a single crime before her arrest, nor will she commit any other crimes, and instead, dedicate her entire life and work to helping the world. I knew her to be hardworking and committed to her aims throughout her young life when I knew her personally, and through her siblings when I heard about her later on when she was in New York and elsewhere.\n\nI want you to be assured of two things specifically, since I have treated former prisoners myself. First, she doesn't need much prison time to learn her lesson the hard way. In fact, I'm sure she already has.\n\nAnd second, she will surely respond to probation responsibly, and dedicate her whole life to ocean clean-up from plastics and all the other debris, or indeed to other critical social causes. This is because she isn't stupid, and after all this hellish fate re Epstein, the only way she will be able to create some good out of her life will be through that kind of dedicated work. Her siblings will certainly support that.\n\nThe faster she can be permitted to rehabilitate herself in that way, the faster she will do only good in this world. More time won't accomplish anything. Your honor, please believe me and only sentence her to the lower range of the sentencing guidelines.\n\nThank you very much for your attention. Sincerely yours,\n\nJames \"Jamie\" Martin Hollomon, JD, MS, LMFT\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010492",
