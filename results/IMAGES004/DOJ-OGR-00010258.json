And otherwise -- well, let me ask you: You were posting on social media about your role as a juror. A. After the trial, yes. Q. So wouldn't your friends and family find out in that regard? A. It just -- I just said that I had served on the jury. I didn't say anything about it in it. Q. There was a communication with one of the witnesses in the case, Annie Farmer, on social media? A. That's right. Q. And you thanked her for sharing your story. A. Yes. Q. What did you mean by that? A. She just shared the article, and then I commented on it; that thank you for sharing my story because she said that I was brave enough to come forward, and so I thanked her for sharing hers as well. Q. So your friends who followed you there would see that. A. I don't have any followers. I think I had like two followers, and they were random things. Twitter is not something I normally use. So I had just randomly seen that she'd shared that. So I felt like I wanted to comment. Q. You testified, when I asked whether you hoped you'd be on SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
