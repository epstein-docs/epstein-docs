My own experience is that she is kind, caring and thoughtful and is always there to provide support as a loyal and generous friend. She has been a mentor, encouraging and helping me to develop my business and gives her time and advice freely.\n\nExhibit G.\n\nAnd, finally, Harriet Jagger, a school mate from age 15, shares Ghislaine's longing for a family life:\n\nThe last time I saw Ghislaine was in her home in New York a few years ago. I listened to her as she spoke of her wish to find the security and happiness within a family unit, she was visibly upset that this, the simplest of things for so many others had still not been a part of her own life. I felt truly sorry for her. Having known her large and great family, her love and great respect for her parents and closeness to her brothers and sisters, I knew this was something she had always craved. I gave her a huge hug on departing. So I was then thrilled to learn that she had finally met and married someone and was helping bring up his young children, but them desperate to hear that this much sought-after joy was so short lived.\n\nExhibit H.\n\nA NON-GUIDELINES SENTENCE WOULD BE \"SUFFICIENT, BUT NOT GREATER THAN NECESSARY\" TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF SENTENCING\n\nAdvisory Sentencing Guidelines\n\nAs the Supreme Court has repeatedly explained, \"a district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable guidelines range.
