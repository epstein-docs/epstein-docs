In several instances, Ghislaine by her own hand, forced me into Epstein's room to be raped.\n\nEpstein and Maxwell were masters at finding young, vulnerable girls and young women to exploit. Upon targeting a vulnerable girl/young woman, they would ingratiate themselves to her, giving her compliments and small gifts, telling her how special she was. They would tell her that Epstein was a very wealthy, generous man whose primary purpose was to help the less fortunate. He and Maxwell were sophisticated, worldly adults with deep ties to important people, world leaders and institutions who could give her the lifeline she needed to make her dreams reality.\n\nHowever, soon after lulling me and others into a false sense of comfort and security, they pounced, ensnaring us in their upside-down, twisted world of rape, rape and more rape.

In my case, Epstein and Maxwell used my damaged upbringing, naivety, lack of a long-term Visa, lack of education and my desire to go to FIT to manipulate and ensnare me.\n\nOnce ensnared, to pacify and keep me, they told me that I was exceptionally intelligent and that I had real potential to be someone and something in life; that my dreams of making my family one day proud of me were achievable; and that Epstein and Maxwell's strong ties to FIT could make this happen.
