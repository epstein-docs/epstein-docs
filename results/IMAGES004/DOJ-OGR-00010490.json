I am a JD graduate of the Univ. of Pennsylvania Law School and an MS graduate of the Univ. of California Santa Cruz in counseling psychology. For the past 27 years I have practiced psychotherapy, first for Butte County's Division of Youth and Adult Services from 1995-2011 and then since then I've run my own private practice here in Santa Cruz, CA. I have never treated Ghislaine Maxwell professionally, Rather, I am writing this as a long-time close friend of the whole Maxwell family including Ghislaine.\n\nMy father, Dr. Herbert Hollomon, met Robert Maxwell, Ghislaine's father, in the mid-1950s because my father was a major research science manager at General Electric Co and Maxwell was by then already a major publisher of world science. Apart from earlier whole family stays with the Maxwells in the early 60s, my parents sent me back to Oxford for an entire summer for work experience and to stay with the Maxwell family in 1966 - Ghislaine was 5. I returned again in 1980 for more work experience that summer and returned multiple times in later years to see the siblings and her mother Betty after DOJ-OGR-00010490",
