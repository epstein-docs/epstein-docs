But she told you that she had learned of it, correct?\n3 A. Yes.\n4 Q. And is it fair that you inferred that she through her\n5 Google search or some sort of investigation had learned that fact?\n6 A. Yes.\n7 Q. So that's what led you just a moment ago to say you knew\n8 that Theresa Trzaskoma had previously learned certain facts\n9 pursuant to an investigation, right?\n10 A. Well, no. What I was trying to distinguish was what I knew\n11 on May 12th, versus what I knew by the time we were writing the\n12 brief.\n13 Q. Okay, and in this brief, the sentence that you just read\n14 conveys the notion, does it not, that you learned of the facts\n15 concerning the suspension and the other things only after you\n16 received a note, correct?\n17 A. Again, that's a difficult question to answer yes or no. I\n18 can see now how it might be construed that way, but when it was\n19 written, and I still believe it was accurate, that it's\n20 describing what we did when we -- and I think it's what I\n21 testified to earlier, that when I received the letter it caused\n22 us concern and prompted us to investigate.
