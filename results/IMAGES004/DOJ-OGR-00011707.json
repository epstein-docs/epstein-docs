But you are not here to judge whether Epstein committed the crimes, you are not here to judge whether the government could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Epstein committed the crimes - you are here to determine whether the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ghislaine Maxwell has committed the crimes charged. When all is said and done, the evidence will show that the government cannot because Ghislaine did not. Now, together with my colleagues - Christian Everdell, Laura Menninger, and Jeffrey Pagliuca - I stand before you proud to represent Ghislaine Maxwell. This case is about memory, manipulation, and money. As you will see, the accusations that you will hear from the mouths of four accusers - not like the hundreds that the government suggested you would hear from - you will hear from them and they will recount their memories, memories of a quarter century ago, memories that have been corrupted by things that have happened throughout the years, manipulated by a narcissistic man and self-interested civil lawyers, and a desire for a big jackpot of money. The government's proof, the government's story relies on the claims of four accusers, four who will say that Ghislaine prepared them or - to use a term that you will hear SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
