See Proposed Redactions in Exhibits A-G. .3 Both Maria Farmer and Ms. Ransome have elected to breach their personal privacy by placing themselves before the media. In addition, Ms. Ransome timed the release of her memoir, “Silenced No More,” (December 7, 2021) and book tour to coincide with her attendance at the trial . The Sentencing Proceeding Should Not Be a Bully Pulpit for Anyone Who Claims Abuse The prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein was an opportunity for alleged victims who were disenfranchised in connection with Epstein’s Florida sweetheart deal to have their voices heard. Epstein’s untimely death following his arrest dealt a further blow to his accusers. Following Epstein’s sudden and untimely death almost three years ago, Judge Berman provided an opportunity for any victim to make a statement regardless of whether they qualified under the CVRA. Kate, Virginia Giuffre, and Sarah Ransome each spoke at that hearing, Annie Farmer spoke solely on behalf of her sister, Maria Farmer. See United States v. Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (Dkt. 53). But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the unique hearing conducted by Judge Berman. The victim statements presented to Judge Berman had no impact on the rights of Epstein, a deceased defendant whose case was required by law to be abated. Such is not the case here. While it is appropriate for the public to be present and for legitimate CVRA 3 Noticeably missing from Ms. Ransome’s statement is conduct that very well may have contributed to her allegations: She was high-priced \"escort\" for Emperor’s Club, the agency patronized by Elliot Spitzer. Litigation cited in her impact statement revealed that in or about October 2006, Ms. Ransome work for an agency, got paid thousands of dollars per \"escort\" and engaged in sexual activity. A modeling photo of Ms. Ransome produced in her discovery appeared on the Emperor’s Club advertisement. The government prosecuted the Emperor’s Club owners. See United States v. Brener, 08 Cr. 533 (DLC), Dkt. 1 (criminal complaint, 08 MJ 463). 7 DOJ-OGR-00010598",
