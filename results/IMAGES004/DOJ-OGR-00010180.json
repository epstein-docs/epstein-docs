We had argued in the original motion for\n4 new trial and we renew that as well.\n5 Finally, your Honor, with regard to the letter of\n6 Catherine Conrad to the government which was referenced in the\n7 defendant's briefing, she talked about their discussions and\n8 deliberations with regard to David Parse. And interestingly\n9 what she also said, which was not mentioned when Mr. Shechtman in\n10 his brief, was that that struggle ended when they asked the\n11 Court to reread the definitions of wilfully and knowingly.\n12 Different states for different counts.\n13 MR. SHECHTMAN: Well, I'll wait. I apologize to the\n14 Court.\n15 MS. DAVIS: And interestingly, their verdict exactly\n16 tracked that difference between wilfully, this was required in\n17 the conspiracy count and for the tax evasion counts, and\n18 knowingly which was really the mens rea relating to other ones.\n19 So you might say that they had a struggle.\n20 To the extent we can even be considering that letter\n21 at all because of Rule 606(b), but I think it's quite clear\n22 that they made a deliberate and informed decision about making\n23 a distinction drawn on the evidence as apply to the law.
