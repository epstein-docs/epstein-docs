I'll try to avoid such interruptions as much as possible, but please be patient and understand that these conferences are necessary to ensure the fairness of the trial and often make the trial go faster. While I decide the law that applies to this case, you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, are the triers of fact. You'll weigh the evidence presented and decide whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the charges in the indictment. You must pay close attention to all of the evidence presented, and you must base your decision only on the evidence in the case and my instructions about the law. What then is evidence? Evidence consists only of the testimony of witnesses, documents, and other things admitted as evidence or stipulations agreed to by the parties. Some of you have probably heard the term \"circumstantial evidence, direct evidence.\" Do not be concerned with these terms. You are to consider all of the evidence given in this trial. Certain things are not evidence and must not be considered by you. The following is a list of what is not evidence: First, arguments, statements, and questions by the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011683",
