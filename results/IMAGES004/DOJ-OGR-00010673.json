Ghislaine, Epstein and Wexner are the ones who should have carried the shame for perverting what was beautiful.\nIt should be known that Ghislaine's impact on my life cannot be understated. Once she gleaned from Vicky Ward (Vanity Fair) that I went to the FBI, my life no longer belonged to me. Aside from living in poverty and obscurity, I have also now had to face public scrutiny as a whistle-blower. I am bullied regularly.\nGhislaine changed everything for the worse. She seemingly derailed me without thought, after I got in her way. She assured me that I could be killed walking down my favorite path in NYC. I never feel safe outside as a result of the massive trauma from being held captive by Wexner's thugs via Ghislaine and Jeffrey. Her threats have never left my mind and I believe she will harm me if she ever has a way. Please keep this in mind when determining her terms of imprisonment. She is a very dangerous and devious individual.\nRespectfully,\nSigrid S. McCawley\n2 of 2\nDOJ-OGR-00010673",
