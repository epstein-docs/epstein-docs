How you do anything is how you do everything. Every single person should have equal value. Every single person should have an equal right to be protected. Every single child must have their innocence defended. No person should be shielded from the consequences of their actions no matter their status or class. Ghislaine's lack of remorse and her blatant refusal to take responsibility for her crimes towards us is the final insult. Having a difficult childhood is irrelevant to the choices she made to traffic and supply women/children to Jeffrey Epstein and other powerful men. Despite the atrocities perpetrated on me, I have never recruited a child or any person to be sexually abused. Someone being a hard worker does not excuse sex trafficking of minors. Someone starting a non-profit does not excuse sex trafficking of minors. Someone who had it difficult or even an abusive father does not excuse sex trafficking of minors. Losing money and prestige does not excuse sex trafficking of minors. The lack of remorse or responsibility taken by Ghislaine for how she ruined the lives of countless women and children is exactly how we can tell that she doesn't think what she did is wrong. She is not sorry, and she would do it again. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011584",
