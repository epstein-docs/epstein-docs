  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 674 Filed 06/24/22 Page 16 of 29\n\nThe manipulation, intimidation, emotional abuse used to control the girls and women took many forms. In my case, Epstein and Maxwell used my damaged upbringing, naivety, lack of a long-term visa, lack of education and my desire to go to FIT and fear to manipulate and ensnare me.\n\nOnce ensnared, between my daily rapes, to pacify me, they told me that I had exceptional potential and intelligence and could become someone and something in life, that my dreams of making my family proud of me were achievable, and that Epstein and Maxwell's strong ties to FIT and important people and institution could make it happen. With their help, my admission to FIT was almost assured.\n\nHowever, there was always a \"but\". First, I had to write my application, which I did; but Maxwell had to review it and conveniently always found fault. Then another \"but\" - I needed to lose 30 pounds because I was a \"piglet\" (one of Maxwell's numerous degrading descriptions of me). Epstein and Maxwell put me on a strict Atkin's diet while simultaneously sending me to a psychiatrist who prescribed anti-depressants (among other drugs I didn't need) that caused weight gain.\n\nIt was a classic no-win situation, and they knew it, precisely what sexual human trafficker seeks. Their cruelty knew no bounds. If I had achieved the desired weight loss, I would have been in a coffin; the FIT application never got submitted.\n\nI thank Almighty God that, in 2007, I eventually managed to escape the horror by fleeing to the UK. Epstein told me repeatedly that if I ever fled, I would be killed, reinforced by Ghislaine.\n\nSince the \"escape\", I have been coping with the daily all-consuming fear and anxiety that Epstein and Maxwell would harm me, my loved ones and my family. I have evidence that, indeed, Epstein attempted to find me in 2017. The trauma of that experience has manifested in significant mental and physical health issues, some of which may never be resolved.\n\nEpstein, Maxwell and their enablers have sold my soul. I pray that the severe emotional distress and anxiety will someday subside. My privacy has been breached, and my reputation damaged. Worst of all, Epstein and Maxwell have taken what should have been the best years of my life away from me. There is no amount of monetary compensation in the world that can replace the time stolen from me and others. Time is priceless, something that not even the wealthiest man in the world can purchase.\n\nI frequently experience flashbacks and wake up in a cold sweat from nightmares reliving the awful experience. I am hypervigilant, experience dramatic mood changes, and avoid certain places, situations and people. I will sometimes start crying uncontrollably and without apparent reason. I have worked hard with several mental health professionals who have diagnosed me with extreme symptoms of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, PTSD, and tendencies to self-harm.\n\nDespite my earnest effort, I have not realized my God-given potential professionally or been able to enter healthy personal relationships. I have never married and do not have children, something I always wished for, even as a little girl. I shy away from strangers and have difficulty making new friends because they could be associated with Epstein, Maxwell and their enablers.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010678",
