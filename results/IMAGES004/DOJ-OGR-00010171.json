And the broker made a mistake. And\n7 here's what makes it so tricky. The shares to the charity were\n8 IBM; the shares to my daughter were Philip Morris. They\n9 reversed it. The charity calls January 2nd and says we can't\n10 take tobacco stock. We can't accept your gift. I call the\n11 broker, I say what about this. He says we'll just reverse it.\n12 It was our mistake. We'll send the Philip Morris to your\n13 daughter and we'll send the IBM to the charity.
