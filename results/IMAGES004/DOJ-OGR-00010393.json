The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the jury on the core of criminality.\n\nSecond, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled in the Indictment and instructed by the Court. Jane testified that after she met the Defendant and Epstein at a summer camp, Epstein began engaging in sexual activity with her at his residence in Florida. Trial Tr. at 293–95, 305–06.

Corroborating evidence included flight records to New York and photos of Epstein’s New York residence matching Jane’s description. See id. at 320.\n\nIn addition to the New York trips, Jane testified about a trip she took to New Mexico with the Defendant and Epstein when she was fifteen or sixteen years old. Id. at 321.
