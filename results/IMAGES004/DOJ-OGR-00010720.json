While at FIT, I took advantage of different volunteer opportunities and internships in the fashion industry to provide a foundation for my career. In my sophomore year, I accepted a Christmastime internship at Henri Bendel, New York. I performed well and was asked to stay on as a part-time employee. I worked at Henri Bendel until graduation.\n\nIn the fall semester of my senior year at FIT Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store, where she was a frequent customer. Her usual salesperson wasn't there so I helped her. Ghislaine was electrifying and we hit it off immediately. In this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion, of difficult fathers and formal upbringings, of boyfriends and of how we both saw New York as a chance to start over. She told me that her boss (who I later came to understand was Jeffrey Epstein) was close friends with Les Wexner, the CEO and Founder of The Limited, which owned Henri Bendel at the time. When she completed her purchases, I offered to deliver them to her, so she didn't have to carry them around all day. This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end clients. Later that day, I called her office for delivery instructions and was told to bring them to the Pierre Hotel close by the store. When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted me to meet someone. It was Jeffrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of many times they sexually assaulted me.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to pretend everything was normal. I returned to my classes at FIT and continued work at Henri Bendel, but I started to crack. I failed a course that was necessary for my degree and had to retake it to get my diploma.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010720",
