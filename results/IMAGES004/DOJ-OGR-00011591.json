  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 737 Filed 07/22/22 Page 72 of 101 72 M6SQmaxS1 Despite my earnest effort I have not realized life's true potential professionally, nor entered any healthy personal relationships. I have never married, and I do not have children, something I always wished for when I was a little girl. I shy away from meeting new people and have difficulty making new friends because I fear they too could be associated with Epstein and Maxwell and their enablers and co-conspirators. To this day I attend meetings to treat alcoholism, but I have had numerous relapses, and I cannot always control that. I know that only by the grace of God do I continue to live. I have attempted suicide twice since the abuse -- both near fatal. Last year, I traveled to New York to attend Maxwell's trial. It was therapeutic to hear the testimony of the four brave victim-witnesses, whose experience paralleled my own, to know that I was not alone, and that our story was finally being told for the world to hear. I am grateful the jury believed the victims and returned a guilty verdict, but a question still tears at my soul. After all of this, how can this five-star general of this enormous sex-trafficking conspiracy involving hundreds, if not thousands, of vulnerable girls and young women over three decades continue to maintain her innocence? Reflecting on it, I know the answer to my questions. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011591",
