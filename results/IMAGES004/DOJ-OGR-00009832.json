The Court Should Conduct the Questioning\nFirst, as noted, given the dangers of harassment and embarrassment presented by juror inquiries, the Court has the power and duty to closely control the proceedings. The Court can—and courts in this District frequently do—choose to personally question the jurors, often giving the parties an opportunity to propose to the Court questions for the Court to ask. See, e.g., Calbas, 821 F.2d at 896 (district court conducted examination of juror, and Second Circuit concluded that the district court “wisely refrained from allowing the inquiry to become an adversarial evidentiary hearing, so as to minimize intrusion on the jury's deliberations”); Loliscio v. Goord, 263 F.3d 178, 191 (2d Cir. 2001) (“[T]he scope of such a post-verdict inquiry, and the extent, if any, to which the parties may participate therein are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial court.”); Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. T&N, No. 87 Civ. 4436 (JGK), 1997 WL 221203, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 1997) (“The Court examined Juror No. 5 under oath in the presence of counsel for both parties, after both parties were given the opportunity to submit proposed questions. To protect the juror from harassment or embarrassment, the Court personally conducted the questioning of the juror.”); United States v. Shakur, 723 F. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (district court examined juror in camera, after permitting counsel to file suggested questions), aff'd 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir. 1989); United States v. Greer, 998 F.
