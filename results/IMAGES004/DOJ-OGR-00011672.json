And I believe the Court does as well. So it's only if we are using to refresh or impeach materials that are not 3500 or the government exhibits, at that point we have paper that we can give to the government and to the Court and the Court's deputy. We're just trying to minimize the amount of paper we have to use. THE COURT: Ms. Comey? Ms. Moe? MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. Just two small points on that. I think Mr. Everdell was mentioning handing out binders to the witness and to the jurors for some of those materials. We just want to note that the government has not yet had an opportunity to review those binders, and so we'd ask for an opportunity to review those before they are handed to the jurors or to the witness. With respect to the second issue of -- THE COURT: Well, I guess let's just take the first one. So certainly before anything is shown to the witness or the jurors, the government and I will see the document. I guess the question is to the extent that there's a binder that they may call the jury and the witness's attention to a document at a time, you're requesting to see the full binder in advance?
