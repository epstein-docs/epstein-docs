EVERDELL: What was -- we gave a number of those in our submissions, but: You talked publicly about the fact that you were in therapy, what was the nature of the therapy? Does it deal with your experiences as victim of sexual abuse? What was the healing process that you talked about? Describe this healing process for me. Does it involve addressing this issue of prior child sexual abuse? Were you in therapy during the trial? Is this an issue that you are still dealing with?\n\nTHE COURT: I did review those questions proposed and I considered them. The defense did not propose any comparable questions for jurors during the voir dire process who indicated yes to this question and indicated a history of sexual abuse, so those requests are denied.\n\nAny other follow-up requests?\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think we need to talk further about the nature of abuse. We talked about the fact this was repeated, happened multiple times. This happened with more than one person, a stepbrother and a friend. I think we need to understand because -- I'm not trying to pry, your Honor, I'm not trying to get into these gory details, but it is relevant, the extent of the similarities of this juror's abuse and whether that lines up with the testimony we heard from the victims is relevant in an inquiry to bias.\n\nAnd I think we need to understand a little more about similar questions that we asked -- we proposed to the Court in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
