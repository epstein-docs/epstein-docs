In a public interview, Juror 50 stated that he \"went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was 'innocent until proven guilty' and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye\" and that his own experience of sexual abuse \"did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty.\" (Gov't Ex. B at 2, 8). These statements are corroborated by the apparent care with which the jury approached its deliberations—asking for testimony and other evidence in numerous questions submitted over the course of multiple days of deliberations—and by its return of a split verdict, in which it acquitted the defendant on one count. See United States v.

And Juror 50's public statements are further corroborated by his answers during voir dire, during which he unequivocally stated that he would be able to follow the law as instructed by the Court, that he would decide the case based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and that, other than what he had been asked, there was no reason to think he could not be fair and impartial.
