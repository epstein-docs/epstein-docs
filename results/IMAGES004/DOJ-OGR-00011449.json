Similarly, the defense does not intend to cross-examine Accuser-1 about [REDACTED] unless the witness's testimony opens the door to such cross-examination.\nHowever, Accuser-1's brother, who is a testifying witness, told the government less than three weeks ago that [REDACTED].\n1 Pursuant to our established protocol, the defense is submitting this letter to the Court under temporary seal to allow the government to propose any appropriate redactions.\nDOJ-OGR-00011449",
