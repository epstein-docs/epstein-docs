Enviable as they are, in many ways they served like a Hampton Jitney in the air. They were used as commuter jets for Epstein to travel with family and friends, guy friends, past, present, and future girlfriends, and an array of other very, very interesting people, academics, politicians, scientists, musicians, celebrities, even a former astronaut who became a senator. And there were families on the flights and children on the flights, high-style commuting. But it was a way of getting back and forth from his properties and taking others along for the ride at times, for them to go to their own homes or to other destinations that were on the way. You'll also hear that Epstein worked out of his office in New York, as well as out of his homes; and that Ghislaine had worked out of his New York office, but then out of her own office in her own residence. There came a time where the companionship part of their relationship ended, but she still remained an employee. She moved on with her life, but she still worked for Epstein. Now, I would love to be able to tell you a progressive once-upon-a-time narration, but the evidence is not conducive for that. I would also like to be standing right in front of you, but these times also are not conducive for that. What you are going to see and what you are going to hear basically center around four women. They are going to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011714",
