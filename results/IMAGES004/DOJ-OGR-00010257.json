Do I have that right? A. Yes, your Honor. Q. And why didn't you think that? A. Well, I wasn't using my full name. I'm also not ashamed about it. It's something that happened, and it's something that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world. Q. And we talked about this, but you understood that there was a high level of press and public attention to the case. Correct? A. Yes, your Honor. Q. Help me reconcile that you didn't think friends and family would learn about your sexual abuse with the fact that you were speaking publicly about it. A. The one thing that I can point to is that when my friends commented, texted me -- commented on my post, texted me about it, they didn't even know that this trial was even happening. So I figured a little article about a juror giving their experience wouldn't be record-breaking or really in the news at all. Q. So you couldn't see how they would find out about it? A. Yes, your Honor. That wasn't something that I was SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00010257",
