The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s decision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the Supreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that the no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of the juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” 137 S. Ct. at 869. Throughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical, constitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not attach to other forms of juror misconduct. Id. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror with racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her consideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v.

According to an article in the Daily Mail, Juror 50 “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual abuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not identify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.
