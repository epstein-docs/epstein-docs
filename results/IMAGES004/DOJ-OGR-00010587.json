At bottom, the defendant does not like jail. But the defendant's experiences at the MDC come nowhere near justifying a downward variance from the Guidelines range.\nFinally, it bears emphasizing that the defendant has told blatant lies about her conditions of confinement. She repeatedly claims to have suffered significant hair loss, but anyone who has seen the defendant in court can easily see that is not true. She repeatedly claims to have lost an extreme amount of weight, but, as noted above, BOP medical records make clear that she has not.\nThe defendant is perfectly healthy, with a full head of hair. Throughout trial, she was visibly engaged in her defense, often actively communicating with defense counsel throughout each stage of the trial. Given the defense's exaggerated claims that the conditions of confinement somehow deteriorated the defendant to the point of struggling to assist in her own defense, the Government respectfully requests that the Court put on the record at sentencing the Court's own observations of the defendant's appearance and demeanor throughout the proceedings in this case.\nIV. Financial Penalties\nIn addition to a Guidelines sentence of incarceration, the Government respectfully submits that the Court should impose the maximum fine allowable under statute. Because each of the three counts of conviction carries a maximum fine of $250,000, the maximum total allowable is $750,000. That amount constitutes a mere drop in the bucket for a multi-millionaire like the defendant, but it nevertheless sends the message that a defendant who uses wealth to accomplish criminal activity will suffer financial losses in addition to the loss of liberty. No amount of money can undo the harm that the defendant's crimes have done, but given the defendant's substantial means, the majority of which appears to have come from her co-conspirator, a hefty fine is certainly warranted in this case.\n50\nDOJ-OGR-00010587",
