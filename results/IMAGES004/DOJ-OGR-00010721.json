It was a newly created position at the store, and it would have required me to leave FIT a semester short of completing my degree. I had aspirations of going to law school and knew I could not do so without my undergraduate degree, so I declined it.\n\nWhen Ghislaine found out she flew into a rage. I didn't understand why until she told me that she and Epstein were responsible for giving me that opportunity and that in turning it down I was being ungrateful. I now know this was their modus operandi - give a gift or favor and then demand sex in return. Nevertheless, I rebuffed the guilt-trip ploy, completed my coursework, and got my FIT degree from FIT, at which point I left Henri Bendel and took a position at Bloomingdales.\n\nI wanted to leave Epstein and Maxwell and the abuse they perpetrated against me behind as I started my professional life. I never wanted to or expected to see them again.\n\nOne day in the fall of 1995 Maxwell showed up at Bloomingdales, looking for me. When I asked her how she knew where I was, she said she asked my colleagues at Henri Bendel. She immediately began befriending me once again, asking me to go out socially. I tried to resist but eventually she wore me down and I began spending time with them again. They made me feel like they were friends, contemporaries.\n\nIn one instance, they took me to Florida, insisted that I stay longer than planned which caused me to miss work and led to my being fired. Seizing on this new vulnerability, they began trafficking me to their friends. By that time, I was trapped.\n\nI was assaulted, raped and trafficked countless times in New York and Florida during a three-year period. At one point I became pregnant (by whom I am unsure) and aborted the baby. Things happened that were so traumatizing that to this day I'm unable to speak about them; I don't even have DOJ-OGR-00010721",
