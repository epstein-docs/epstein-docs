DAUGERDAS, ET AL.,\nFebruary 15, 2012\nPage 221\nC2frdau7 Conrad - cross\n1 MR. OKULA: Let me have one moment, your Honor.\n2 Q. Ms. Conrad, a few more questions. I'm sorry. Are you\n3 ready?\n4 A. Yes.\n5 Q. At the time that you were selected to serve as a juror in\n6 this case, your status was a suspended New York attorney,\n7 correct?\n8 A. Yes.\n9 Q. You were not working, correct?\n10 A. Correct.\n11 Q. Is it fair to say that even though the daily witness fee\n12 that you received for your service was rather meager, it was\n13 not irrelevant to you in your service as a juror?\n14 A. Yes, that's correct.\n15 Q. After all, you were basically out of work, correct?\n16 A. Yes.\n17 Q. You referred earlier during Mr. Gair's questioning to a\n18 motivation that you had in the form of intellectual curiosity\n19 with respect to tax shelters, is that correct?\n20 MR. GAIR: Objection to the form of the question, your\n21 Honor.\n22 MR. OKULA: I'll rephrase it, your Honor.\n23 THE COURT: All right.\n24 Q. You remember in Judge Pauley's initial instructions he\n25 described in general terms the subject matter of the case, in\nC2frdau7 Conrad - cross Page 222\n1 particular tax charges, correct?\n2 A. Yes.\n3 Q. You heard certain things about tax shelters in the\n4 introductory instructions, correct?\n5 A. Vaguely.\n6 Q. Is it correct that the subject matter of the case was of\n7 some interest to you when you were answering questions during\n8 voir dire and considering your motives for serving on the jury?\n9 A. Yes, it piqued my curiosity. I had no experience ever with\n10 tax work.\n11 Q. Had you ever sat as a juror in a federal criminal case\n12 before?\n13 A. No.\n14 Q. Was one of your motivations a desire to see a trial through\n15 with this complexity from beginning to end?\n16 A. Partially.\n17 Q. One final question, Ms. Conrad. Is it correct that you\n18 waited until Judge Pauley told you it was appropriate for you\n19 to begin your deliberations and the consideration of the\n20 evidence based on his instructions, and that's what guided your\n21 verdict in this case?\n22 A. Yes.\n23 MR. OKULA: I have nothing further, Judge.\n24 THE COURT: Redirect examination, Mr. Gair.\n25 REDIRECT EXAMINATION\nC2frdau7 Conrad - redirect Page 223\n1 BY MR. GAIR:\n2 Q. Can you explain to us how is it you can remember the\n3 substance of many specific jury instructions that you received\n4 8Â½ months ago when you cannot remember things that you said to\n5 Judge Pauley on December 20th when you appeared in this court?\n6 A. Because I'm familiar with the PJI and they are sort of\n7 basically the same IN state court as in federal court.\n8 Q. Did you have any trouble understanding my questions when I\n9 was asking you questions earlier?\n10 A. To which are you referring?\n11 Q. Any of them.\n12 A. I don't have the transcript written in my head.\n13 Q. You certainly didn't have any trouble with Mr. Okula's\n14 questions, correct?\n15 A. He's pretty straightforward.\n16 Q. You didn't find anything that Mr. Okula said that you\n17 disagreed with, correct?\n18 A. Correct.\n19 Q. Did you know what Mr. Okula was going to ask you today?\n20 A. No, I don't. This is the first time I've ever actually\n21 spoken to Mr. Okula.\n22 Q. Mr. Okula asked you about whether or not you wanted to see\n23 through this trial as a juror. Do you remember that question?\n24 A. Yes.\n25 Q. You did, right?\nC2frdau7 Conrad - redirect Page 224\n1 A. Yes.\n2 Q. You did that in the context of just a day or two before the\n3 trial having filed a petition for readmission or reinstatement\n4 to the bar, is that correct?\n5 A. That's the correct chronology, yes.\n6 Q. You believed that by seeing through this trial, by serving\n7 as a juror for a lengthy trial, you could help demonstrate your\n8 stability to the bar authorities, correct?\n9 A. No. It's apples and oranges. The two thoughts never\n10 crossed.\n11 Q. Never occurred to you once that seeing this through might\n12 be something that would be helpful to you with the bar\n13 authorities?\n14 A. Not at all. It was my civic duty.\n15 Q. Which part was your civic duty? The part where you lied?\n16 A. No, of course not.\n17 Q. Mr. Okula asked you some questions about the instructions\n18 that Judge Pauley gave you. Do you remember those?\n19 A. I remember both.\n20 Q. You said that you had followed Judge Pauley's instructions,\n21 correct?\n22 A. Yes.\n23 Q. But the truth is you only followed those of Judge Pauley's\n24 instructions that you wanted to follow, correct?\n25 A. I don't know what that question means, sir.\nPage 221 - Page 224 (56)\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS",
