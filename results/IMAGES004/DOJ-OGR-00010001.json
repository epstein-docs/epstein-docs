That's my understanding, yes.\n5 Q. And your team analyzed it and other information that you\n6 all had gathered at that point, correct?\n7 A. I think what happened, and I wasn't as close to it as\n8 others, is that we received the questionnaires together with\n9 the jury list and then started kind of focusing on the\n10 questionnaires. But I agree with you that we received both.\n11 Q. And the Nardello firm provided to you the results of the\n12 research that it was asked to do prior to the start of voir\n13 dire, correct?\n14 A. That's right.\n15 Q. Now, you conceded in your papers that you had in your\n16 possession the 2010 suspension opinion related to Catherine M.\n17 Conrad prior to the start of voir dire, correct?\n18 A. I certainly said that and it's so.\n19 Q. And in fact, Theresa Trzaskoma told you and showed you that\n20 opinion prior to the start of voir dire, correct?\n21 A. I don't think it was prior to the start of voir dire, but\n22 it was in the morning before court, maybe some point mid-voir\n23 dire, and I don't know that she showed it to me, but we\n24 certainly discussed it in the presence of Dennis Donahue, the\n25 jury consultant.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
