It's confidential to the extent that we, as the program administrators and my\n4 staff and contractors, would be protecting the privacy of the victims. We wouldn't be sharing\n5 any information with the estate or publicly. But the confidential requirement is\n6 unilateral. It's only imposed on us and there's no requirement whatsoever that\n7 claimants limit their-- what information they want to share with whomever they wish -- you\n8 know, investigators, the public.
