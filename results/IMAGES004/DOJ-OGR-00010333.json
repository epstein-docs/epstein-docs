The Court also rejected many of the Defendant's proposed lines of questions. The parties were also permitted to propose follow-up questions at the hearing in light of the Court's questioning and Juror 50's responses. The Court accepted some of these proposals and rejected others.\n\nJuror 50 testified that his answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not accurate.
