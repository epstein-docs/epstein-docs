And a series of proceedings\n6 then occur, essentially initiated by both the Court and the\n7 government to find out what they knew and when they knew it.\n8 And their statements in their memorandum to the Court on their\n9 motion that they knew were wrong or misleading at the time that\n10 they made them to me.\n11 MR. SHECHTMAN: You're not going to get much argument\n12 from me on the point. The Court has a sort of lovely phrase in\n13 the opinion about disclosure by iteration or something like\n14 that. There is no doubt when you go from the telephone\n15 conversation to the document itself, and then to and not\n16 wanting further discovery, wanting your Honor to somehow\n17 address a preliminary issue and issues of privilege. Your\n18 Honor knows I got in this case late and the first thing I did\n19 was to say, what are we kidding ourself? We are going to turn\n20 over those documents to the Court because worse comes to worst,\n21 the Court is going to look at them in camera. And if it is\n22 going to look at them in camera, it is going to look at them, I\n23 don't know you can say out of camera, but it's going to look at\n24 them. This is not a game.\n25 I think what happened, though, is lawyers said to\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
