No. To the contrary, she seemed to be who she had\n5 presented herself to be.\n6 Q. You in fact did not raise any concerns with the Court at\n7 any point during trial about her behavior as a juror?\n8 A. No, I saw no cause for concern.\n9 Q. Now, you were also present for the process leading up to\n10 jury deliberations, correct?\n11 A. When you say the process, I'm sorry.\n12 Q. I'll withdraw the question. You were present in court when\n13 Juror No. 1 sent I think a note, I think it might have been\n14 marked as Court Exhibit 3, prior to the start of jury\n15 deliberations, correct?\n16 A. I was present in court, although I don't think I knew at\n17 that point what -- because I think what happened, I may be\n18 getting it a little wrong, but on May 10th, judging from the\n19 date on the note, she sent the note and then I recollect that\n20 Judge Pauley disclosed the note after all counsel had summed up\n21 and my recollection was that he did that because he didn't\n22 think it was fair to provide the note in the middle of\n23 summations. So he must have received it somewhere along the\n24 middle of the summations.\n25 Q. And you were present when the judge read the note to\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
