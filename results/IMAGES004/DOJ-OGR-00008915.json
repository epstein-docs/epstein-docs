While discovery materials themselves may not be judicial documents, Juror 50's motion is not a discovery document. The Defendant also fails to articulate how docketing Juror 50's own motion could affect the testimony of any potential witness and ultimately affect the integrity of any inquiry into Juror 50's conduct. The possibility of media attention does not outweigh the presumption of access. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Defendant's alternative request to seal the motion.\n\nThe Court reserves judgment on whether Juror 50's motion should be redacted in light of the principles and conclusion discussed above or on another basis. The parties may propose any narrowly tailored redactions to Juror 50's motion that are consistent with this Order via email on or before February 16, 2022. The parties also submitted letters to the Court via email on January 13, 2022, that addressed sealing of Juror 50's motion. Any redactions to those letters must be proposed by that same date. As noted above, the Court will rule on any proposed redactions so the filings can be docketed, and the Court will file under seal unredacted copies of any documents for which it approves redactions.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDated: February 11, 2022\nNew York, New York\n\nALISON J. NATHAN\nUnited States District Judge",
