So, I think that expert testimony, by itself, sufficiently will describe the bedsores that Mr. Jones was suffering at the time of his death.\n\nMR. HOBSON: To be clear of what photographs we are introducing, we are not introducing the most graphic pictures of the bedsores. In fact, we were concerned in introducing some of the pictures that they wouldn't fully show how serious the bedsores were but we are not going to be putting in the most graphic pictures.\n\nTHE COURT: What I am going to allow is you will have some permission to lead with respect to the description of the injuries and sores. It's going to be brief and extraction of facts that you need that is not cumulative with medical testimony and evidence that's coming in. We will see how it goes but I am -- I intend to be extremely cautious given that this is non-expert medical testimony coming from a relative. So, the prospect of prejudice and emotion and sympathy is real and I'm not going to let it happen.\n\nMR. HOBSON: Yes, your Honor. We understand.\n\nTHE COURT: Anything else?\n\nMR.
