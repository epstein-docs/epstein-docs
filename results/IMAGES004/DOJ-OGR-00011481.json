  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 734-4 Filed 07/15/22 Page 4 of 9 agreement showing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the attorney or a signed statement by an adult Claimant and the attorney that a licensed/admitted attorney is acting on her behalf. III. CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION - SUBMISSION, EVALUATION AND DETERMINATION A. Claims Submission Process Individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before the Effective Date will be sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information, including Instructions for completion and submission of the Claim Form and a copy of this Protocol. Individuals who have filed a lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to be eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals must, however, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at the time of acceptance of a compensation determination offer in order to receive payment. Individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before the Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program's website at www.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire setting forth their name, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested information. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the individual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is eligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant Program information. Note: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It does not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive compensation. That determination is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has been submitted and evaluated by the Administrator. Registrations for individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before the Effective Date will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective Date through a date that is 45 days prior to the Filing Deadline (\"Registration Deadline\"). It is important to note that the Registration Deadline is separate from, and precedes, the Filing Deadline. As explained above, all claims must be filed by the Filing Deadline. 4 | Page DOJ-OGR-00011481",
