Now, Ms. Brune, you are an officer of this court, correct?\n4 A. I am.\n5 Q. And as an officer of the court you have ethical\n6 obligations, correct?\n7 A. I do indeed.\n8 Q. And you have an obligation to be truthful to the Court?\n9 A. Yes.\n10 Q. And you have an obligation to promptly disclose to the\n11 court any information that you might have suggesting juror\n12 misconduct, correct?\n13 A. I don't agree with your characterization. I had an ethical\n14 obligation to bring whatever material that I thought was\n15 accurate to the Court and that's what I tried to do throughout\n16 the trial.\n17 Q. On May 12, 2011, you received information, significant\n18 information that related potentially to Juror No. 1, correct?\n19 A. On May 12 I had a discussion with Theresa Trzaskoma in\n20 which she described her sort of wondering whether the juror who\n21 had sent that note referring to respondeat superior and\n22 vicarious liability was the lawyer whom she'd earlier located\n23 by a Google search. I don't think that I received significant\n24 information, but I did have a conversation with Ms. Trzaskoma\n25 about the note, which was at that point new to us.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00009321",
