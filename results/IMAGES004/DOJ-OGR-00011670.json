THE COURT: I think it's just a distancing question to make sure that we have sufficient space. So maybe what we can do is have kind of a first layer of lawyers -- a first layer of lawyers and then -- MS. STERNHEIM: A backup team. THE COURT: -- a backup team behind them so that we're keeping everyone distances, as is required. MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you. I think Mr. Everdell has an issue. MR. EVERDELL: Yes. Thank you, your Honor. Just a matter of choreography. Assuming we do get to witnesses today, pursuant to the Court's instructions, we have a binder of materials for the witness. Once cross begins, we'll need to take just a brief break to deliver the binder to the witness box. And I believe for the first witness we may have some manila folders to hand out to the jurors which we would instruct them not to look at until they are instructed to do. THE COURT: Okay. And does this overlap with the request put in yesterday regarding using video for cross? MR. EVERDELL: It does, your Honor. We have prepared as if we need binders. We still would like that request to be considered so that we can use electronic, but we have prepared the first couple witnesses with binders. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
