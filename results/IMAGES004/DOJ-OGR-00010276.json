(Opp. at 15-16). The first point is irrelevant and the second is based on a disingenuous reading of the Jury Note. As to the flights, it is true that one of the jury's questions was whether it was sufficient to convict under Count Four if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell assisted with Jane's return trip from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico.

The jury was asking whether they could convict on Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell's intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico.
