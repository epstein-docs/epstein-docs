I want to highlight just a few of those ways for you now. First, you will hear from the victims, including Jane herself. They will take that stand and describe the sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of the defendant and Epstein. They will tell you about the defendant's significant role in that sexual abuse, how the defendant helped put them at ease, how she talked about sexual topics with them, how the defendant was sometimes in the room for the sexual abuse, how the defendant sometimes touched their bodies, how the defendant encouraged some of them to travel with Epstein to his homes. These witnesses will be testifying about some of the most painful and private experiences of their childhood, experiences they couldn't talk about for years, experiences that forever changed their lives, experiences that scarred them. You will also hear that a fund to compensate girls who Epstein abused awarded some of these witnesses millions of dollars, but it will be obvious to you at this trial that these witnesses would have paid anything for this not to have happened to them. They would pay anything to have never met the defendant and Epstein. You'll also hear from people who knew some of the victims, who knew them not as the adults that you will see during the course of this trial, but as the kids they were when SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
