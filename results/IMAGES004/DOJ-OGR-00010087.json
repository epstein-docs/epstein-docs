And would you turn to page 9 and look at the first full\n17 paragraph there. Would you read that first sentence aloud for\n18 us?\n19 A. \"The tone and content of the letter, which were in sharp\n20 contrast to the image Conrad had projected through the trial,\n21 always head down, taking notes, caused defendants concern and\n22 prompted them to investigate.\"\n23 Q.
