She helped me certainly with the closing\n4 statement, but you're right, she was not on the trial team.\n5 Q. She generally did not appear at court appearances, though,\n6 is that correct?\n7 A. That's correct.\n8 Q. And you've had many trials, both in your government\n9 experience and your experience as private counsel, correct?\n10 A. You know, I've had three trials as a defense lawyer. So I\n11 don't know if that would qualify as many. But I certainly have\n12 handled quite a few between work in the government and work on\n13 the defense.\n14 Q. And I take it that when you were an assistant you also\n15 conducted many Grand Jury investigations, correct?\n16 A. Many.\n17 Q. And you know that an important part of any Grand Jury\n18 investigation are the details, correct?\n19 A. That's certainly so.\n20 Q. And you know how to pay attention to details, is that\n21 correct?\n22 A. I try very hard to pay attention to detail.\n23 Q. And I take it that you would agree that you were vested in\n24 the success of you law firm, correct?\n25 A. I am very vested, very proud of it.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00009988",
