His testimony did not evince any intent to deceive or mislead the Court when completing the questionnaire. Rather, it was consistent with his statements in the Daily Mail interview, which was when Juror 50 first learned that the questionnaire may have contained a question that asked about his own sexual abuse history. (Id. at 15:19-22). And it was during the Daily Mail interview, when first confronted with the possibility of having made a mistake, that Juror 50 told the reporter that he \"could not remember\" the part of the questionnaire asking whether he had experienced sexual abuse, but he \"was certain that he had answered all questions honestly.\" (Dkt. No. 643, Ex. B at 8). Juror 50's sworn testimony at the hearing echoed his comments to the press when he learned of his error.

When the Court inquired at the hearing about Juror 50's answer to Question 25—which asked whether he or any relatives or close friends had been a victim of a crime—Juror 50 explained that \"[l]ooking back at [Question 25] now,\" his negative answer was incorrect. (Id. at 9:22). He explained that he \"wasn't thinking of [his] sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime because [he] no longer associate[s] being a victim\" and that he had been thinking of whether he had been \"robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that\" at the time he was completing the questionnaire.
