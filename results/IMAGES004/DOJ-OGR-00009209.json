Juror No. 50's answers were deliberately false.\n\nEven so, the record more than supports the conclusion that Juror No. 50's answers to Questions 25 and 48 were deliberately false. Juror No. 50 knew he was the victim of a crime. He was a prospective juror in a case where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with minors. As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood sex crime, there is no plausible explanation for why Juror No. 50 did not answer Question 25, \"Yes.\" The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question \"Yes\" would lead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what happened to him, which would end with his disqualification.\n\n6 Greer, 285 F.3d at 173.\n7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither necessary nor sufficient to entitle a defendant to a new trial. It's not necessary because, if a biased juror actually serves on a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required even if the juror did not provide a deliberately false answer during voir dire.

And it's not sufficient because a juror may not be biased even if he dishonestly answers a question during voir dire.
