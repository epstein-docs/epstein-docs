Ghislaine was no exception in deeply absorbing, exhibiting and living these values. For example, I think it is no small feat to train and become a helicopter pilot, an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), submersible pilot and more, as they all require dedication, concentration and quick thinking and reactions and no small amount of courage. These are not the usual pursuits of a \"flibberti-gibbet\" or a \"socialite\", terms with which my sister has been branded with to this day.\n\nGhislaine was always an extremely generous, thoughtful and kind host in New York to her many siblings including me, and her many nieces and nephews which I deeply appreciated. She also helped our mother greatly in her late life and exhibited deep caring and concern which I noticed personally on many occasions. For example she dropped everything and flew to France at her own expense to help me with medical issues our mother was having and to just be there to comfort her. She also did not hesitate to help her many personal friends with their problems not only with kindness but practical help too and did not ask for anything in return.\n\nMy sister was also very entrepreneurial in creating and investing in multiple companies and organizations which created products and services, as well as employment. An important example is that in 2012, Ghislaine turned a lifelong passion for the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, with the mission to create a \"global ocean community\" based on the idea of shared ownership and responsibility of the global \"commons\"—the high seas or international waters. Efforts like these to help our planet are sorely needed and frankly, our fragile Earth continues to need all the help and activism it can get. It would be within your power to allow her to renew her fight as soon as possible for Ocean conservation In light of the dire warning just issued by the UN that the \"Earth's oceans have reached the hottest and most acidic levels on record\".\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-00010498",
