(Id.) The addition of Sarah Kellen as a co-conspirator towards the end of the conspiracy does not create multiple conspiracies. See United States v. Reid, 475 F.

That is non-sensical. Count Three charges a conspiracy lasting continuously from 1994-2004. Just because three of the witnesses testified about conduct in the 1990s and one of the witnesses testified about conduct in the 2000s, that does not mean that the 1990s conduct was somehow more important or more relevant to Count Three than the 2000s conduct. As charged, the conspiracy spanned the entire time period. Hence, the temporal overlap between Count Three and Count Five was not “minimal,” as the government contends. (Opp. at 31). It was complete. The time period of Count Five was entirely contained within, and overlapped with, the time period of Count Three.\nFinally, the government disingenuously argues that the geographic scope of the two conspiracies did not overlap because Count Three “was focused on travel to New York,” whereas Count Five “largely concerned conduct that took place in Florida.” (Opp. at 31-32).
