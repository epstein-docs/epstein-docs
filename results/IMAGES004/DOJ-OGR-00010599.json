STERNHEIM\nvictims to be heard, Ms. Maxwell's sentencing proceeding should not be an open-mike forum for any alleged victim.\nImpact statements by alleged victims who did not testify, were not referenced in the record as victims, or do not qualify as \"crime victims\" under the CVRA should be published during the sentencing proceeding or have their statements included in the record. While the Congressional Record is silent on this issue, it is hard to believe that Congress intended the CVRA to give voice to anyone and everyone who claims to be a victim but does not qualify under the statute and whose accusations have not been verified. A high-profile case, such as this, becomes a lightning rod for individuals to come forward, especially where to do so may yield financial reward and media attention. Such an open forum would have significant and adverse consequences to any criminal defendant facing the most critical stage of the case: sentencing and deprivation of liberty.\nMs. Maxwell's sentencing proceeding should not a bully pulpit for anyone who was not identified as a victim of the charged federal offenses and does not qualify as such under the CVRA. We urge the Court to undertake its role as gatekeeper to ensure that Ms. Maxwell's rights are not trampled by individuals who are not statutory victims or by the rights afforded to legitimate victims under the CVRA. To ensure that the appropriate balance of rights is achieved, those who qualify under the CVRA offenses should have the right to be heard but their statements should be in accordance with redactions and rulings made by the Court.\nBecause the Individuals do not meet the definition of \"crime victims\" under the CVRA, they should not be permitted to give oral testimony or have their written victim impact statements read during sentencing.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-00010599",
