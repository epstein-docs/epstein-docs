THE COURT: I think what I will do is go back and ask: Did you understand at the time you talked to the press in the way that you did, did you understand that it would be publicly known that you were a victim of sexual abuse? We'll see what he says. Did you think about the consequences of talking to the press about that? Did you talk to the press, the press reporter about the consequences? It's difficult for me to see what it's going at, but I will seek clarification on his answers, as I did multiple times, on the reconciling and understanding his thinking about coming out publicly as a victim of sexual abuse. He has explained some of the transformation process and the like. You can make your arguments about credibility. But I will go back and see if there's something to ask regarding talking to the reporter about the consequences. Which also there's a temporal issue here, he didn't think about it until he talked to the press, and in the course of that the press talked to him about the consequences and that changed his understanding potentially.
