Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: The Government respectfully submits this letter regarding the proposed limiting instructions in the Court's order regarding Witness-3. (See Dkt. No. 477). The Government proposes one edit to the instruction in advance of Witness-3's testimony. Specifically, the Government proposes inserting the word \"solely\" in the sentence beginning \"However,\" as follows: However, you may not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of the testimony regarding the sexual conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein. This edit clarifies a potential tension within the instruction. As the Court has ruled, evidence relating to Witness-3 is relevant to the issues, but cannot on its own support a conviction. Absent this clarification, it may appear to the jurors that they \"may not convict the Defendant on the basis of [Witness-3]'s testimony,\" i.e., the testimony is not offered as relevant evidence the 1 DOJ-OGR-00011304",
