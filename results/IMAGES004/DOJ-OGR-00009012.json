The defense proposed to ask potential jurors: (1) \"Whether reported or not,\nhave you, any family member or anyone close to you, including a child/minor, ever been\nthe victim of any form of sexual abuse? (This includes actual or attempted sexual assault\nor other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member;\" and (2) \"Whether reported or not, have you, or anyone close\nto you, including a child/minor, ever felt in danger of being sexually assaulted by another\nperson, including a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member?\" Doc.\n367, p 21. The government objected to Ms. Maxwell's proposed questions. Id. The Court\npartially agreed with the prosecution, asking a single question about whether potential\njurors had been actual victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment.\n\nSpecifically, Question 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or\nattempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a\nstranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nThe questionnaire offered three answers: \"Yes (self),\" \"Yes (friend or family member),\"\nand \"No.\"\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-00009012",
