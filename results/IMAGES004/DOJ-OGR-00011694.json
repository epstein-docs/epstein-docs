First, I will tell you what I expect the evidence is going to show. Second, I'm going to talk about the different types of evidence that will prove that Ghislaine Maxwell is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. So what will the evidence show? You're going to learn that the man and woman I just mentioned were Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell was Epstein's best friend and right hand. Epstein was a multimillionaire connected to famous and powerful people. He lived a life of extraordinary luxury. He owned many properties, including a villa in Palm Beach, Florida, a mansion in Manhattan, a ranch in New Mexico, and an apartment in Paris. He even owned an entire private island in the United States Virgin Islands. And he had staff who worked for him in his various homes. Epstein also owned private planes. He had pilots who worked for him full-time, flying him to his properties and other locations in the United States and internationally. The defendant got to enjoy that luxury right along with Epstein. Starting in the early 1990s, the defendant was in a personal intimate relationship with Epstein, they were a couple for many years, and when their relationship ended, they remained, in the defendant's own words, the best of friends. The defendant was Epstein's closest associate and SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011694",
