And you didn't -- that is actually not answering the question I asked.\n2 A. I'm sorry. Do it again and I'll try to get it.\n3 Q. You understood this was significant information potentially, yes?\n4 MR. GAIR: Objection, asked and answered, your Honor.\n5 THE COURT: Overruled.\n6 A. If it was the same person it is significant information, that's correct.\n7 Q. And you didn't need anyone to explain to you that it was potentially significant information?\n8 A. No.\n9 Q. And that it would be significant to Judge Pauley, correct?\n10 A. I believe that it was certainly going to be significant to Judge Pauley if it was the same person.\n11 Q. And one way you find out if it's the same person is to ask Judge Pauley to ask the potential juror, correct?\n12 A. No. If the person has sworn under oath that her highest level of education is college and has disclaimed any contact with any disciplinary authority, I don't think that was the reasonable course at all. What happened --\n13 Q. Let me stop you there, Ms. Brune. Are you saying --\n14 MR. SCHECTMAN: Judge, I'm okay with some stopping, but really not in the middle of answers.\n15 THE COURT: Right.
