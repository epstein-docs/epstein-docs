The shorthand notes in 3509-002 was turned into an FBI 302 which makes clear that the statement was consistent. See 3509-001 p.1, second paragraph. Witness was crossed on the notes; the agent's typed report was three months later. The notes and report are inconsistent with each other and the witness. A live witness should clarify. 455:3 - 18 3509-008, p.12, 4th paragraph They visited Jane one to two times at her house in Florida. This was about a year or two after meeting him. Objection. Not inconsistent with the witness's testimony, and when confronted with the statement, she said it was correct. The witness did not agree that the statement was accurate, equivocated with \"I guess.\" Entitled to demonstrate prior inconsistent statement per FRE 613. 470:21 - 471:18 3509-005, p.3, first paragraph Fairly early on Maxwell 'joined in' and started taking her clothes off. This was about six months into being with them. Jane was still 14 at this time. Jane does not have a specific memory of the first time. Objection. Defense counsel did not show the witness the inconsistent statement FRE 613(a) does not require that witness be shown document; gov't counsel could have requested the cite (as they did with others). 471:18 - 22 3509-008, omission Objection. Question is too vague and untethered from time to constitute an inconsistent omission. To the extent it is, the witness was not confronted with Impeachment by omission. 2 DOJ-OGR-00011290",
