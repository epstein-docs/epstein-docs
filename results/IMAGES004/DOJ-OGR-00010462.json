Her work was a far cry from the 'flippity-jibit socialite' label that the media has decided to cast on her every time they reference her.\nExhibit C.\n[F]rom a very early age each of us had to learn and demonstrate what our father termed \"the 3 Cs: Consideration, Concentration and Conciseness\" and to \"always treat others as you would like to be treated yourself.\" We were quizzed on these principles constantly and had to regularly report examples of how we followed them. Ghislaine was no exception in deeply absorbing, exhibiting and living these values. For example, I think it is no small feat to train and become a helicopter pilot, an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT),submersible pilot and more, as they all require dedication, concentration and quick thinking and reactions and no small amount of courage.\nMy sister was also very entrepreneurial in creating and investing in multiple companies andorganizations which created products and services, as well as employment. An important example is that in 2012, Ghislaine turned a lifelong passion for the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, with the mission to create a \"global ocean community\" based on the idea of shared ownership and responsibility of the global \"commons\"—the high seas or international waters.\nExhibit D.\nHer brothers, Ian and Kevin Maxwell, confirm the support Ghislaine has provided to others:\nMy sister is Aunt to 13 nieces and nephews (now aged 18 to 37) and I have witnessed at first hand over the years her generosity to them - be it paying their school fees, mentoring them and they grew up or providing job opportunities for them. She also has an enduring capacity for friendship, a warm heart, and the ability to convert those feelings into action when required to help those less fortunate than herself. She had discreetly supported some friends financially and others by providing a roof over their heads when they were down on their luck, often for weeks at a time.\nExhibit E.\nGhislaine is an intelligent, warm hearted, generous, kind, funny, thoughtful and loving person. She cares about others. Ghislaine's first reaction on hearing of a problem is how tosolve it or how to contribute to a solution.
