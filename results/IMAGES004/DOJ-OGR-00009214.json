This Court should reject the government's attempt to manufacture a \"Show Hearing\".\n\nTo read the government's brief, one would think this Court could hold a meaningful hearing at which it (and not the parties) would pose two softball questions of Juror No. 50:\n\nThe government implies that an affirmative to either question would end the hearing.\nNot so.\n\n1. The lawyers should conduct the questioning.\n\nFirst, the parties should be permitted to question Juror No. 50, as occurred recently in this judicial district. United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 306 (2d Cir. 2006) (\"We therefore caution district courts that, if any significant doubt as to a juror's impartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an evidentiary hearing generally should be held. Such a hearing is often the most reliable way for discerning the true motivations behind a juror's false replies.\") (citations omitted).\n\n8 \"[A] show trial can be defined by the presence of two elements.
