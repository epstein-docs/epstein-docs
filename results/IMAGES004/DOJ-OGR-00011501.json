  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 734-5 Filed 07/15/22 Page 15 of 17\n\nAdministrator's eligibility decision regarding your claim; (2) the amount of compensation offered; (3) a Release to be signed by you if you accept the offered compensation; and (4) a Payment Option Form. The Administrator's offer will be valid for 60 days from the date of the compensation determination letter.\n\n6. By accepting the compensation offered, do I waive my rights to file, continue or initiate legal actions or claims?\n\nYes. If you choose to accept the compensation offer, you will be required to release all past and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of attachment, etc.) relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein and specific entities and individuals identified in the Release. Nothing in the Release, however, will limit or preclude you from discussing your claim with law enforcement or anyone else. In other words, the Release will not impose any rules of confidentiality on Claimants, who are expressly permitted to discuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\n\nBefore signing a Release, you must consult with an attorney. If you are not represented by an attorney, the Program will provide an attorney, who will offer free legal counseling to you for the sole purpose of advising you concerning the language and binding nature of the Release.\n\n7. When and how will payments be made?\n\nPayments will be issued by the Program to eligible Claimants on a rolling basis, after the Administrator has issued a compensation offer, and has received the Claimant's acceptance of the Administrator's compensation offer and signed Release, and proof of lawsuit dismissal with prejudice, if applicable. The Program will authorize the payment, by check or electronic funds transfer, to each Claimant as directed by the Claimant.\n\n8. Is the compensation payment tax-free?\n\nPursuant to the Protocol, all payments made under the Program shall be for physical injuries, physical sickness and resulting emotional distress within the meaning of Section 104(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, no one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under the Program. You are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding tax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n\n14 | Page\nDOJ-OGR-00011501",
