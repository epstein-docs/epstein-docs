I posted FAQs on the EVCP website that address the scope and assurance of confidentiality. A copy of the EVCP FAQs is attached to the motion as Exhibit E (see Questions 5, 6 and 11). I also issued several press releases during the claims process that highlight confidentiality as a \"cornerstone\" of the EVCP and of \"paramount importance.\" Copies of EVCP press releases are attached as Exhibits B, C, and F.
