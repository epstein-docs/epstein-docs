It's certainly so that many of the government witnesses were lawyers and that some of them had pleaded guilty. 4 Q. And their pleas included pleas to making false statements to the IRS, correct? 6 A. That's true. 7 Q. So it's not inconceivable that attorneys lie, correct? 8 A. I don't think that's what I said, but it's certainly not inconceivable that lawyers lie. 9 Q. And at the end of that conversation, you told Theresa Trzaskoma to leave it, correct? 11 A. I don't remember the words, but something to that effect. 12 Q. Now, she had been the partner in charge of the jury selection, correct, in terms of the detail work? 14 A. I was in charge of the jury selection. But you're right, she was closer to it than I. 16 Q. Did she tell you in that conversation that she had basically an \"oh, Jesus\" moment? 18 A. She certainly did not say that. 19 Q. There was a possibility, Ms. Brune, that this was in fact true information. As you're standing there out in the plaza, that information existed, correct? 22 A. I didn't believe that at the time. 23 Q. Well, you didn't know, bottom line is you didn't know one way or the other, correct? 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00009344",
