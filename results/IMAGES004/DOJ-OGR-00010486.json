Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\n\n3rd May 2022\n\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nThis is a joint letter from Anne Holve (née Maxwell), and from Dr Philip Maxwell, eldest siblings of Ghislaine Maxwell. We are worried that the legal process as it moves to its close might not include information that provides a better understanding of Ghislaine.\n\nThe traumatic background of Ghislaine began with the 1961 automobile accident to our eldest brother Michael who suffered fatal injuries that hospitalized him in a coma for 7 years until his death. These were the first seven years of Ghislaine's life. (The accident happened when she was 3 days old). Our entire family was shaken up by this. My mother gave almost daily attention at Michael's hospital bedside until his death.\n\nWe believe that forensic psychologists use objective scales of trauma. Also clinical psychoanalysts could assess her case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010486",
