And you will hear that we will question witnesses, we will put in evidence, we will make objections for the judge to rule on. But I ask you to keep in mind that in asking questions of witnesses that may make witnesses feel uncomfortable, there is no interest in asking those questions to shame anyone. The purpose of our job is to see whether the government has proven the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, and you do that through questioning. Now, the government went through the charges, and I'm just going to quickly wrap them up. Counts One and Three are conspiracy charges; One having to do with enticing minors to cross state lines, and Three having to do with transport of minors across state lines. And those pertain to all four of the accusers. Counts Two and Four, which are called substantive crimes, allege actual enticement and actual transportation. And those only pertain to Jane. Now, with regard to Counts Five and Six, the trafficking charge, charges conspiracy and the substantive offense. As I said before, that only pertains to Carolyn. I ask you to keep that in mind. But with regard to any of the charges, the proof that the government has indicated they will put forth the stories of SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011733",
