She found her passion in life at aged 50, when she poured her heart and soul into setting up and running a non-profit environmental organization, The TerraMar Project. During its development, Ghislaine reached out to me for educational and publishing advice. One measure of its success is evidenced in the major collaborations with entities and organizations, such as National Geographic and Oxford University, that she managed to secure. These recognized leaders could not afford to be linked to anything but the most reputable entities, which is how they viewed Ghislaine's endeavor. Each allowed their logos/names to be associated on the public TerraMar website.\n\nGhislaine is a caring person. The goals that she set for TerraMar were laudable and reflect her concern for the well-being of humanity. The only reason she was compelled to close down the Project was to protect the supporting individuals and groups from being hounded and starting to be vilified by the Press after her arrest. I know that Ghislaine still very much wants to find more ways to give back to society.\n\nWe live in a world where malicious envy of people seen to have wealth and perceived 'undeserved' social position in life, is perfect fodder for selling newspapers and filling social media platforms with gaudy, single faceted views. Ghislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her positions demanded hard, diligent work, great intelligence, great management skills, great ability to get on well with people from all walks of life, artistic creativity, and caring about others. Her work was a far cry from the 'flipflop-jibit socialite' label that the media has decided to cast on her every time they reference her.\n\nI am asking you to consider a lesser sentence for my sister Ghislaine. If Ghislaine is able to regain freedom while she still has all her faculties, I know she has much to still offer in dedicating the rest of what is left of her life to advocacy to helping others. Thank you for your consideration of all the points in my letter that speak to the worthiness of Ghislaine's contributions and abilities, and to her truly wanting to make a positive difference again if given the opportunity to do so.\n\nRespectfully,\nChristine Malina Maxwell\nCHRISTINE MALINA MAXWELL\n11420 Santa Monica Blvd. #25424\nLos Angeles, CA 90025\n\nPage 2 of 2\nDOJ-OGR-00010495",
