To be sure, every time Jane denied making a statement but agreed the 3500 material reflected the statement, she denied its substance to the jury; the prior statement is therefore provable by extrinsic evidence because Jane's trial testimony—I did not make the prior statement, or I don't remember making the prior statement, the FBI agent made a typo—would lead to a relevant conclusion different from any other relevant conclusion resulting from anything the witness said. See id. And referring Jane to the 3500 material, which was not admitted into evidence, is not sufficient to protect Ms. Maxwell's right under Rule 613 to prove the statement by extrinsic evidence.\n\nExtrinsic evidence is disallowed only when the witness admits making the prior inconsistent statement.
