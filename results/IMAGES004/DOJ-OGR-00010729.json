Nathan, Sitting by Designation United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's June 25, 2022 Order directing the Government to confer with the Warden of the Metropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\") regarding the defendant's access to legal materials and counsel.1 This morning, the Government spoke directly with the Warden and the Chief Psychologist of the MDC. Based on that conversation, the Government understands that the defendant currently has access to all of her legal documents in hard copy and is able to confer with defense counsel. Accordingly, there is no basis to adjourn sentencing in this matter. 1 The Government first learned of the defendant's newly raised concerns about her conditions of confinement through the publicly filed letter from defense counsel last night. (Dkt. No. 677). Defense counsel did not confer with or seek assistance directly from the Government before filing that letter. 1 DOJ-OGR-00010729",
