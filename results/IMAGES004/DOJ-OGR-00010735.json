It took all of us by surprise. Within one week of Maxwell arriving, She had volunteered to teach ESL, Teach Yoga, and help women with their GED. I believe It's important to know that there are also positive opinions, some of which are among inmates in the Unit. I believe that is also good to point out the good in people. ~Tatiana Venegas",
