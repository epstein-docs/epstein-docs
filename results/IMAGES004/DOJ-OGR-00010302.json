(See, e.g., Juror 7; Juror 20; Juror 37; Juror 54; Juror 89; Juror 151). It is even more unlikely that they would learn about his experience with abuse given that Juror 50 did not use his last name, disconnecting his press interviews from his Google search results, and that he gave two of his three interviews to foreign press. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 8-9).
