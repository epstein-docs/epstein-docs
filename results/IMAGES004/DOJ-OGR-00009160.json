The same is true here: a newspaper report about an anonymous juror who had experienced sexual abuse is not “incontrovertible evidence” that juror misconduct occurred.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Bin Laden, one defendant sought a new trial based on a sentence in a newspaper article, which, based on interviews with jurors, stated that “[o]ne juror used the internet at home to research a difficult legal concept concerning [one] defendant.” The district court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, holding that “[t]his single sentence, an unsworn snippet of hearsay within a newspaper article, is far less substantial than the sworn affidavits present in cases where evidentiary hearings have been ordered.” United States v.

The district court denied a hearing with regard to this (and the other) allegations, as it was based on (a) statements of an individual who “appears to be reporting rumors,” and (b) an anonymous call to the defendant’s lawyer from an individual purporting to work for Citibank. Id. The Second Circuit affirmed that decision, noting that the defendant’s factual proffer as to this (and certain other) allegations was “insufficient.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 305 & n.7.
