Once we have our jury selected, my intention is to go back to the live feed to that courtroom, read the numbers of the selected jurors, and then have Ms. Williams escort those jurors to the jury room to put down their things and gather their contact information and the like, rest room and the like. At that point I'll ask counsel if there's any reason why the remaining jurors cannot be dismissed, take any issues, dismiss the jurors who are not selected. And then we'll bring in the jury, and we'll swear them in. Then we'll commence with preliminary instructions that everybody has seen, and opening statements. We will seat the jurors taking account of any unvaccinated jurors, because the district has different distancing rules for unvaccinated jurors -- unvaccinated individuals, if we do have any on the jury. What we'll do is once they're seated, we'll produce a list by where they're seated so that you know which juror is seated where. And that is what I have. Any questions or requests or otherwise? MS. COMEY: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank you. MS. STERNHEIM: I just have one sort of a protocol question.
