They told me that if I told anyone, nobody would believe me and if they did, they would kill me and the people closest to me. I believed them. I was once bright, fun, outgoing and kind.

After meeting Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, it felt like someone shut off the lights to my soul.\n\nMy secrets became too much for me to handle, and I began doing whatever I could to try to get away from Maxwell and Epstein. I changed jobs, apartments, cities and even states to try to get away. Everywhere I went, they found me. In 1997, I moved to Philadelphia with the hopes of finally starting law school.

It would be the first of over two dozen hospitalizations in the decades following my involvement with Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nIn addition to my escalating mental health problems, I began to experience physical symptoms that doctors could never quite put their finger on. I received dozens of diagnoses but nothing ever quite fit.
