(In open court) THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, you may continue. MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you. In bringing this case against Ms. Maxwell, the government has reached back almost a quarter of a century and they are looking through a rearview mirror with 20/20 vision, which you will hear is hindsight bias. And there will be experts who will explain that to you, what that means, how you look at something later and it has a different meaning. What we have here is lawful conduct that is going to be labeled grooming; it has been labeled grooming by the government, asking someone what they like to do, whether they like a movie, whether they like going shopping. The government wants you to put a sinister subjective motive in Ghislaine where the evidence will show none existed. Now, you heard about the fund, and that's where money comes in. Now, for individuals to collect under the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund, they have to submit a claim. And their claim is enhanced if they cooperate with the government. And the witnesses here have, by speaking with the government, testifying for the government, they have enhanced their claims. And each of the witnesses who will testify here have gotten money, a lot of money, from the Epstein fund. And part of the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011724",
