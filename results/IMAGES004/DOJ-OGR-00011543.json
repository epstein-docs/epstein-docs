Her testimony establishes that she was still going to the house throughout that time period. We do not agree that we're required to show that any conspirator took a specific act in that exact window but just that the conspiracy was still live, and the fact that there were additional acts ratifying membership of the conspiracy throughout 2004 and into 2005 satisfies that burden. THE COURT: Again, just to make sure I'm not missing anything you want to point to, the into 2005 is pointing to post conspiracy conduct. MS. MOE: Post indictment conduct, your Honor. THE COURT: Post indictment. Is it in some way not post conspiracy? MS. MOE: Well, your Honor, again, the question before the Court, according to the application is when the did offense end. THE COURT: Ms. Moe, I do understand you're framing that question. I'm asking record evidence question. Is there something you're pointing to for your statement, the post 2005 which consists of conspiratorial conduct? MS. MOE: I think separate from the 2005 evidence, we would point to in the fall of 2004, a message from Carolyn in November of 2004 showing that she was contacting the house to make a scheduled appointment.
