  "full_text": "Scotty David, who wishes to be identified by his first and middle name, told The Independent in his first media interview that he believed all of the victims who testified against Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex-trafficking trial that took place in lower Manhattan over the past four weeks. All of the accusers corroborated each other and were backed up by other evidence, he said.\n\nDavid said he is proud to be part of holding Maxwell accountable for her crimes.\n\n\"This verdict is for all the victims,\" David told The Independent. \"For those who testified, for those who came forward and for those who haven't come forward. I'm glad that Maxwell has been held accountable.\n\n\"This verdict shows that you can be found guilty no matter your status.\"\n\nDavid told The Independent that he found all of the accusers who testified to be believable and credible, despite the defence's many attacks on their credibility and their attempts to poke holes in their memory.\n\n\"They were all believable. Nothing they said felt to me like a lie,\" he said.\n\nDavid knows that sometimes you can misremember small details of traumatic memories without ever doubting the core of the memory. He knows that because he is himself a survivor of sexual abuse.\n\n\"I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the colour of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video,\" he said. He explained this to the jury.\n\n\"But I can't remember all the details, there are some things that run together.\"\n\nSo he knew that some misremembered details doesn't mean the memory itself didn't happen.\n\nThere were also questions from the jury about why the girls didn't come forward earlier.\n\nBut David said he knows what's like, too. \"I didn't disclose my abuse until I was in high school,\" he said.",
