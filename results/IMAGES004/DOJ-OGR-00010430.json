In fact, the evidence clearly showed that by that time, Ms. Maxwell was in a committed relationship with another man and Sarah Kellen had taken over responsibility for scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence.\nMs. Maxwell's assistant, Kimberly Espinosa, testified that by 2002 Ms. Maxwell had \"moved on\" from Epstein, had stopped coming to the office, and had begun a long-term relationship with Ted Waitt. (Tr. 2370-71, 2374, 2378-80). Juan Alessi testified that Sarah Kellen, whom he recalled seeing for the first time towards the end of his employment in 2002, \"immediately took over\" responsibility for answering the phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she was hired. (Tr. 832-33). Carolyn testified that Ms. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments only in \"the first year or two\" and that Sarah Kellen called her thereafter. (Tr. 1527). In sum, the record is clear that by 2002 or 2003 at the latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been replaced by Kellen.\nApplying the 2004 Guidelines would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell's sentencing range based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in offense conduct in the final two months of 2004 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and was not personally responsible for. That result would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to the purposes of sentencing. See United States v. Reuter, 463 F.3d 792, 793 (7th Cir. 2006)\n9\nDOJ-OGR-00010430",
