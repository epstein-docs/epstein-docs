He (our father) was a powerful and dominant figure. And as elder siblings we witnessed our father taking Ghislaine under his wing whereby she became over dependent on his approval and vulnerable to his frequent rapid mood swings, huge rages and rejections. This led her to becoming very vulnerable to abusive and powerful men who would be able to take advantage of her innate good nature.\n\nIt is striking that Ghislaine did not show any perverse behaviour before she met Epstein. Nor did she show any after leaving him, which she eventually managed to do. The effect of our father's psychologically abusive treatment of her, foreshadowed Epstein's own ability to exploit, manipulate and control her.\n\nExhibit A.\n\nAnother psychotherapist and family friend of some 55 years, James Martin Hollomon, recalls his observations of Ghislaine's father:\n\n[T]heir father was narcissistic, demanding and highly controlling. He let them know early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity. So, all the kids knew they had to \"make it on their own\" despite the wealth and privilege in which they were growing up. As I got to know each of these kids, including Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one worked very hard at their jobs, as Bob wouldn't bear any idleness, and each strove for their father's and mother's respect through their intelligence and their own hard work.\n\nExhibit B.\n\nHer twin sisters, Christine Malina Maxwell and Isabel Maxwell, attest to Ghislaine's work ethic:\n\n[W]e were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not always perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael was gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his death when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to adapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\n\n[B]oth of our parents had an incredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to respect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in Ghislaine.\n\nGhislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her positions demanded hard, diligent work, great intelligence, great management skills,\n\n14\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010461",
