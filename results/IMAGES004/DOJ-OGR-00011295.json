Objection. Not inconsistent with the witness's testimony. The witness agreed with most of this, and said she did not recall the timeline. Nor is it clear from the 3500 material that the events occurred before the pool house incident, as suggested on cross. Witness recounted a number of events (including this one) that occurred before any abuse started; other testimony in the case establishes that Epstein did not own the green car until she was much older. 532:12 - 17 3509-001, p. 2, 2nd full paragraph Epstein, Maxwell, or an assistant would call Jane's house phone. There was an assistant named Lesley, Maxwell's assistant named Emmy Taylor, and another assistant named Michelle. Objection. Not inconsistent.
