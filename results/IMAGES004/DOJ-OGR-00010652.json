Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: I am counsel for Juliette Bryant, and I am providing the following victim impact statement for the Court's consideration with respect to Maxwell's sentencing. Pursuant to the Crimes Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Juliette Bryant qualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking from 2022 to 2004. Ms. Bryant was unable to leave her small child to travel from South Africa for the sentencing hearing and is therefore, unable to attend. Ms. Bryant therefore respectfully requests that the Court read her statement into the record or, alternatively, allow her attorney representative Sigrid McCawley to read the statement on her behalf. [Redacted] I appreciate Your Honor imposing the maximum sentence available. Respectfully, Sigrid S.
