As a factual matter, the record is crystal clear that these witnesses were not with the defendant and Epstein at “every moment” during the period charged in the Indictment. See Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043140, at *4. It would thus be “impossible” for them “to testify that [the] defendant did not commit the charged crimes, so whatever helpful testimony [they] might have offered (the details of which are sparse in the motion) would be easily undermined on cross-examination.” Id.

Moreover, even assuming that these witnesses would have testified as the defendant claims and that such testimony would have been admissible, the defendant does not address why the unavailability of these particular individuals has caused her actual prejudice when other employees who worked for Epstein and the defendant were available to offer (and did offer) testimony about Epstein’s residences and the defendant’s role and time spent at such residences. It is the defendant’s burden to establish that these witnesses’ testimony could not be put before the jury through other means, and the defendant has not established—and cannot establish—that these four witnesses were “key” witnesses who would have testified at her trial in an irreplaceable way that would have helped, rather than hurt, her.
