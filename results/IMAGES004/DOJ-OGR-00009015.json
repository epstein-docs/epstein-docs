The defense responded in part that \"asking the questions live when the jurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by the parties will aid in the selection of an impartial and fair jury.\" Id. The Court denied the defense's request. Juror No. 50 appeared for his voir dire on November 16. Because Juror No. 50 answered \"no\" to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just seven pages of transcript. TR 11/6/2021, pp 128-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask Juror No. 50 whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and impartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set aside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms. Maxwell's defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers' memories. As to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal background),",
