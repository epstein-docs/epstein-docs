All family assets were frozen, Elisabeth Maxwell was left penniless, the brothers were tried and ultimately acquitted, and Ghislaine was left to fend for herself.11\nLife After Epstein\nIn 2003, Ms. Maxwell began a seven-year romantic relationship with Theodore “Ted” Waitt and developed a strong and loving bond with his four children, ranging in age from six to twelve. Her relationship with Waitt was on track for marriage and gave her what she had always hoped for and wanted most - the opportunity for a loving, stable family life and the chance to become stepmother to Waitt’s children. But her hopes were destroyed, as was so much of her life, by her previous association with Epstein. A Miami lawyer named Scott W. Rothstein, Esq. attempted to blackmail Waitt to keep Ms. Maxwell’s name out of civil lawsuits related to Epstein that his law firm was planning to file. Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with Waitt could not survive the blackmail threats and it ended soon afterwards.12 The same thing has now occurred again several years later as a result of this prosecution. In 2013, Ms. Maxwell began a new relationship with the man she would later marry.

As Ms. Maxwell plans to appeal her conviction, we will not comment on the events during this time period that were the subject of the trial.\n12 Through his law firm, Rothstein Rosenfeld Adler (“RRA”), Rothstein perpetrated a massive $1.2 billion dollar Ponzi scheme in Florida. Touting RRA as the “preeminent sexual harassment firm in the country,” Rothstein claimed to be representing numerous underage girls who had been involved with Epstein. In the spring of 2009, RRA recruited Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., who immediately joined the firm. By the end of October 2009, Rothstein became a fugitive, and later returned to face arrest, to plead guilty to RICO charges in SDFL, and to receive a 50-year sentence. See 09 Cr. 60331(JIC). Rothstein had targeted Waitt, the deep-pocket co-founder of Gateway, Inc., because of his ongoing relationship with Ms. Maxwell, who had previously been involved with Epstein. Rothstein demanded $10 million to keep Ms. Maxwell’s name out of civil lawsuits. Waitt successfully resisted Rothstein’s blackmail attempt, but Ms. Maxwell was named in lawsuits filed by RRA. Ultimately, Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with Waitt did not survive the ordeal. See PSR at ¶¶151-152.\n12 DOJ-OGR-00010459",
