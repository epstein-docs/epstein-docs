The alleged victims' conduct, explained Juror No. 50, was irrelevant to their credibility. In Juror No. 50's view, Ms. Maxwell's defense team was continually attacking the alleged victims and trying to get the jury to judge them for their decisions, as opposed to arguing that their stories were not worthy of belief.\n\n2. The interview with the Daily Mail\n\nOn January 5, the Daily Mail published an article based on its interview with Juror No. 50,6 in which he described Ms. Maxwell as a \"predator.\" Juror No. 50 also shared that he helped other members of the jury understand things from a victim's point of view and explained how \"you can't remember all the details\" of traumatic memories: \"there are some things that run together.\" When Juror No. 50 told his fellow jurors of the abuse he suffered, the room \"went silent.\" Although he couldn't remember every detail, there were others that stuck with him: \"I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video.\"\n\nJuror No. 50 said the verdict was for \"all the victims.\"\n\n6 https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10370193/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html\n\n13\nDOJ-OGR-00009712",
