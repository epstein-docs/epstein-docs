And you asked nothing of her on what facts she had that 5 demonstrated that to her? 6 A. No, I didn't. 7 Q. And is it correct that Ms. Trzaskoma asked you or threw out 8 the possibility of doing further research on this Catherine 9 Conrad that she had found information about? 10 A. I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. 11 Q. Did she ask whether anything more should be done to look 12 into this? 13 A. We discussed after she raised the issue with us, you know, 14 what Juror No. 1's responses were on voir dire. We concluded 15 that we did not believe they were the same person and we 16 decided that we didn't need to do any more research at that 17 point. 18 Q. Well, you say \"we discussed.\" Tell us your best 19 recollection what was said. 20 A. I can't recall precisely what was said. I think what we 21 did was we reviewed what Catherine Conrad had said on voir 22 dire, what her responses were and to us that ruled out the 23 possibility that she was the suspended lawyer. It was just 24 inconceivable to me that she was a suspended lawyer. Why would 25 she lie about her highest level of education? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00009401",
