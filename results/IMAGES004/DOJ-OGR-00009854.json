I don't want to call her a monster, but a predator is the right word'\n- During the trial Scotty, who works in finance, was seated in the third row of the jury box, in the back corner. From his vantage point, he said, he had a vista of the entire court and the 'perfect view' of Maxwell herself\n- Scotty said that Maxwell's manner in court was discussed during deliberations.
