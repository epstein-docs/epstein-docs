Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\nDear Judge Nathan:\nMy name is Jeffrey Roth, I am on the staff of The New York Times and I am a cousin of Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell. We have known each other for fifty years. My Mother, Jolana Roth and her late father, grew up together. Our families have been close for ninety years.\nI attended the trial as a family member and am aware of the charges that she has been found guilty of. Ghislaine is a friend and confidant.\nForthright, kind, respectful. Qualities that all parents hope for in their children. I saw those in Ms. Maxwell many times and especially towards her late Mother, Elisabeth. When Betty would come to the States, I would come by and here's what I observed. A kind, caring daughter who was respectful to her Mother and to all around her. Qualities learned and inherited and apparent to all. That's who Ghislaine is.\nRespectfully,\nJeffrey Roth\nDOJ-OGR-00010514",
