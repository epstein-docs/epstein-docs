You used the phrase\n2 a couple of times in discussing your brief \"missed the issue.\"\n3 What precisely do you mean by that?\n4 A. We were so focused on establishing that this was the same\n5 person. And on the waiver issue I was very focused on the\n6 reality, which is that we didn't know. So, the issue that I\n7 missed was that there are things in the brief, without knowing\n8 what we knew, could be read to understand that the first time\n9 we even did the Google search was after we got the letter. And\n10 that's not right and that's the thing that I really regret.\n11 What we were trying to convey was we were shocked,\n12 which was true. But I think that there are phrases in the\n13 brief which, if you don't know what we knew, could be read\n14 differently. That's not the standard that we aspire to as a\n15 firm, and in that we fell short.\n16 Q. David Parse was convicted of some of the charges, correct?\n17 A. Two of the six, that's right.\n18 Q. He was acquitted of the other four charges, correct?\n19 A. Yes.\n20 Q. You thought that the jury rendered a fair and impartial\n21 verdict on those acquitted charges, didn't you?\n22 A. Yes, I did.\n23 MR. DAVIS: No further questions.\n24 THE COURT: Mr. Shechtman, do you have inquiry to\n25 make?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00010048",
