I wasn't thinking about middle initials. I know that 8 in hindsight we now know that they're the same person and that 9 they have the same middle initial, but at the time I had no 10 idea that Juror No. 1's middle initial was M. 11 Q. Theresa Trzaskoma didn't tell you that the report that she 12 had seen on either e-mail or otherwise had the middle initial 13 with M. for Catherine M. Conrad, the suspended New York 14 attorney? 15 A. Ms. Trzaskoma did not mention any report. 16 Q. Did Ms. Trzaskoma mention to you the Westlaw printout that 17 she had seen that had various biographical information for 18 someone named Catherine M. Conrad? 19 A. No. 20 Q. Did you ask Ms. Trzaskoma for any of the underlying 21 documents that led to her belief that Juror No. 1 may be the 22 same Catherine M. Conrad who was a suspended New York attorney? 23 Yes or no, did you ask for any documents? 24 A. I did not ask for any documents, no. 25 Q. How long did this conversation between you and Ms. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00009389",
