My interaction would be mostly when they either boarded or exited the airplane. I would assist with loading luggage. So my interaction was brief. Most of my duties were obviously up 3 4 5 in the cockpit. 6 Q. How, if at all, did you learn the names of passengers on a particular flight on one of Mr. Epstein's planes? 7 8 A. It was mainly not a priority to get a name, but we would try to be as accurate as we could. We would -- Mr. Epstein, 9 Ms. Maxwell, or even any of these secretaries at the office 10 would say, you know, so many people are going on the aircraft. 11 It wasn't as much important as a pilot knowing that how many 12 people were going as opposed to specifying the name if it was a 13 domestic flight. If it was an international flight, I would 14 need their names, et cetera. 15 16 Q. Did you learn the name of every single passenger who flew on Mr. Epstein's planes? 17 18 A. No. 19 Q. Why not? 20 A. Like I said, it wasn't a priority. I tried to get their 21 names. Typically, it was usually the same people that flew, so 22 I recognized their names with the first introduction. But it 23 just -- it wasn't convenient to get it. That wasn't my job to 24 jot down every person that flew on the aircraft. 25 Q. What, if any, of Mr. Epstein's residences did you visit SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011750",
