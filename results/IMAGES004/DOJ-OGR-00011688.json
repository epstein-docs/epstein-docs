This is critically\n6 important to ensuring a fair trial, which I know that all of\n7 you would want if you were a party in this court, and I have no\n8 doubt it's what you want for the parties who are here today.

But you don't have to take notes. Notes are just an\n15 aid to your own recollection. The court reporters in this case\n16 record everything that's said in the courtroom, and any portion\n17 of the testimony can be read back to you during your\n18 deliberations. If you do take notes, be aware that note-taking\n19 may distract you from something important that's happening on\n20 the witness stand. Whether or not you take notes, rely on your\n21 own recollections and don't be influenced by the fact that\n22 another juror has taken notes.
