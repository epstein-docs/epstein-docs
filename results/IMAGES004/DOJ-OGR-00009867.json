REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - During jury deliberations after the trial of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, some jurors initially doubted the accounts of two of her accusers, one member of the jury said on Tuesday night. This juror, who asked to be identified only by his first and middle names, said some of the jurors had issues with the credibility of witnesses known as Jane and Carolyn, two of the four women who testified that Maxwell set them up with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein as teenagers. He said that after some of the jurors questioned the accuracy of the two women's memories, he decided to share his own experience of being sexually abused as a child. He said that he remembered most important elements of what happened to him, but not every single detail. That swayed some jurors, he said.

He gave an earlier interview to The Independent. He added that coming to a unanimous verdict \"wasn't easy, to be honest.\" \"There's a room of 12 people and we all have to be on the same page and we all have to understand what's going on,\" he said. \"And then we have to agree. So that's partly why it took so long.\" Maxwell, 60, was convicted on Dec. 29 of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for sexual encounters with Epstein. The conviction followed five full days of deliberations. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/some-ghislaine-maxwell-jurors-initially-doubted-accusers-juror-says-2022-01-05/ 2/16 DOJ-OGR-00009867",
