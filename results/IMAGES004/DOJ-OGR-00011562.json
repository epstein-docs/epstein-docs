  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 737 Filed 07/22/22 Page 43 of 101 43 M6SQmax1 was extensive. Whether criminal activity is extensive is based primarily on the number of people involved, criminally and noncriminally, rather than on other possible indicators of the extensiveness of the activity. District courts must determine the number of knowing participants in the criminal activity, the number of unknowing participants whose activities were organized or led by the defendant with specific criminal intent, and the extent to which the services of the unknowing participants were peculiar and necessary to the criminal scheme. For example, a taxi driver that drives a defendant to a crime scene would not count. That is an example from a case called Carrozzella, 105 F.3d at 804. At all relevant times, the conspiracy proved at trial included at least two knowing participants: Epstein and the defendant. Beginning in 2002, Sarah Kellen joined, and beginning in approximately 2001, additional minor victims were recruited through Virginia and Carolyn. Additionally, trial evidence established that services were unknowingly provided by various Epstein employees. For example, I credit Juan Alessi's testimony that following the defendant's instructions, he scheduled massage appointments, set up the massage table for appointments, cleaned up after sexualized massages, and on at least one occasion drove Virginia to an appointment. Additionally, both Visoski and Rodgers were employed as Epstein's pilots over the same time period as the counts of SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011562",
