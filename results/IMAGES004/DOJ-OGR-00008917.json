Any authorized amicus brief must be emailed to the Court for docketing within one week of the Court's granting of the motion for leave to file. The Court provides one note of caution regarding timing. As of Wednesday, February 9, 2022, the Defendant's motion for a new trial became fully briefed. Although the timing of the Court's ruling on the motion cannot be predicted at this time, the Court will rule as expeditiously as possible. The Court will not delay issuing a ruling if ready to do so simply because an authorized amicus brief is forthcoming. If NACDL still seeks leave to file an amicus brief, it may submit a renewed motion consistent with this Order. SO ORDERED. Dated: February 11, 2022 New York, New York ALISON J. NATHAN United States District Judge",
