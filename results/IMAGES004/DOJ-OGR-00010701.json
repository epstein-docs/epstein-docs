She told the court that the defendant was a dangerous man who had threatened to kill her. The Sixth Circuit held that the sentencing court possessed discretion to hear from the wife under section 3661. The Court explained that the CVRA \"did not alter (or, more importantly, limit) a district court's traditional broad discretion to consider a wide variety of factors at sentencing.\" Id. at 434.\n\nThese authorities clearly support the principle that this Court has broad unlimited discretion in sentencing Maxwell to hear from anyone it believes will have relevant information.
