The Mann Act conspiracy counts (Counts One and Three) alleged generally that the object of the conspiracies was to entice or cause underage girls to travel across state lines with the intent that they \"engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.\" Ind. ¶¶ 12, 18.
