Now, we're talking about events that took place 15 to over 25 years ago, and as we all know, memories fade over time, and in this case, you will learn that not only have memories faded, but they have been contaminated by outside information, constant media reports and other influences. Manipulation. Yes, Jeffrey Epstein manipulated the world around him and the people around him. He compartmentalized his life, showing only what he wanted to show to the people around him, including Ghislaine. You will hear that the accusers themselves were manipulated by those around them, especially civil attorneys who saw Epstein and Ghislaine as easy targets for lawsuits and, of course, money. As you heard, Epstein's estate set up a victim's compensation fund to pay accusers who claimed to be of a certain age and have had contact with Epstein. But those claims met the most minimal requirements, and certainly not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The fund did not challenge the accusers, did not check facts, didn't ask questions. Each accuser who applied to the fund - who will testify here - received millions of dollars from Epstein's estate, and it made it very easy for these women to include Ghislaine Maxwell when it really always was about Epstein. Now, Ghislaine Maxwell is on trial because of her SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011708",
