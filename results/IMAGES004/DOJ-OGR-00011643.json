What I would just say is, if your\n5 expert, looking at the 3500 material and the disclosure, has\n6 different expert views, you need to notice those now. But to\n7 the extent it's something that comes out at trial, that\n8 couldn't have been anticipated, then you can notice down the\n9 road.\n10 So just in terms of what, if your expert has testimony\n11 now that's different from what's anticipated in light of the\n12 government's notice and the marked exhibits and 3500 material,\n13 when would you like to provide additional notice?\n14 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, some of the \"marked\n15 exhibits\" are a placeholder for an entire hard drive that has\n16 any number of documents on it. If the government is now\n17 representing they will only be referring to the documents that\n18 are separately marked and not to exhibits that say \"hard drive\n19 58,\" \"hard drive 85,\" \"hard drive 96,\" we could do that, but\n20 they haven't made that representation.\n21 THE COURT: Fair enough.\n22 MR. ROHRBACH: Those drives are marked for\n23 identification for authentication purposes, but to the extent\n24 that the point is that Mr. Kelso is going to testify about\n25 general principles associated with the creation of documents\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00011643",
