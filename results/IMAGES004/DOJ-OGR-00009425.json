How many years did you spend as an Assistant U.S. Attorney,\n14 Mr. Schoeman?\n15 A. A total of about seven or eight.\n16 Q. I would stipulate to the fact, because I've heard it, that\n17 you were a terrific investigator, correct?\n18 A. I'll stipulate with you.\n19 Q. Are you telling us really that you wouldn't have looked\n20 into that further yourself if you had seen these further\n21 connections tying Juror No. 1 to the suspended attorney?\n22 A. Forgive me.
