Please print your juror number in the space provided at the top of each page. Do not write your name on the questionnaire. Please answer each and every question fully. Some questions have more than one part.\n\nYOU ARE SWORN TO GIVE TRUE AND COMPLETE ANSWERS TO ALL QUESTIONS IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. This questionnaire is designed to help simplify and shorten the jury selection process. The purpose of the questionnaire is to determine whether prospective jurors can decide this case impartially based upon the evidence presented at trial and the legal instructions given by the presiding judge. The questions are not intended to inquire unnecessarily into personal matters. Although some of the questions may appear to be of a personal nature, please understand that the Court and the parties must learn enough information about each juror's background and experiences to select a fair and impartial jury.\n\nPlease answer all questions to the best of your ability. If you do not know the answer to a question then write, \"I don't know.\" There are no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answers, only truthful answers. If you have strong feelings about this case in general, please do not hesitate to share them. Although you may be a perfectly good juror in another case, this may or may not be the right case for you to sit on as an impartial juror. Both parties have the right to get honest answers and to hear your true opinions. Do not discuss the case or your answers with anyone. It is important that the answers be yours alone. Remember, you are sworn to give true and complete answers to all questions.\n\nIf you need extra space to answer any question, please use the extra blank sheets of paper included at the end of the questionnaire. Be sure to indicate on the blank page the number of the question you are answering. Do not write anything on the back of any page.\n\nDO NOT DISCUSS YOUR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS OR THE CASE WITH ANYONE, NOW OR UNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTED BY THE COURT. You should not discuss the questions or answers with fellow jurors. It is very important that your answers be your own individual answers. More broadly, do not discuss the case with anyone, including the lawyers (except in the presence of the Court), your fellow jurors, your family, your friends, or anyone else. Do not communicate about the case in any way, including telephone, e-mail, any social media app or website (such as Facebook), any communications app or website (such as Twitter). You must also avoid reading or hearing about the case (or anyone participating in the case) in newspapers, in magazines, on the radio or television, or on the Internet.\n\nDO NOT DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ON THE CASE. Do not conduct any research into the case (or anyone participating in the case) at any time before your entire jury service has been completed. That includes performing Internet searches, asking other people about the case, reading news stories, books, or reports about the case, or watching films or television programs that relate to the case. Do not read, watch, or listen to any information about this case.\n\n-3-\nDOJ-OGR-0009760",
