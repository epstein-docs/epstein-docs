To be clear, Ms. Maxwell is not agreeing to the admission of any statements proffered by the government under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) for many reasons including the fact that she was not a member of any conspiracy as alleged in the indictment. Ms. Maxwell understood that, in her conferral letter to the government, she was identifying her good faith objections given established Second Circuit procedures governing the admissibility of the proffered statements.
