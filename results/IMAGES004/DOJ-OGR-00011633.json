To the extent there's an exhibit that can otherwise be shown electronically, like other exhibits that can be shown electronically, of course we have no objection to that. But for documents that contain identifying information, given the location of the jurors' screens in this courtroom and how they would be visible to members of the public, we would request that they be treated like other sealed exhibits. MR. PAGLIUCA: These are not exhibits, your Honor, so they won't be admitted into evidence. THE COURT: Same issue, right? MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes. THE COURT: Whatever they are, we're protecting anonymity, which is my order. Screens are visible. Should that be an issue with respect to anything you want to show for refreshing recollection, why not show that on -- you'll show that on paper. MR. PAGLIUCA: It's an unwieldy and impossible project here, your Honor. THE COURT: To use paper? MR. PAGLIUCA: To use -- THE COURT: The way trials have been done for a very long time? MR. PAGLIUCA: It is likely there will be -- there are thousands of pages of potential material that will be at issue. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011633",
