The motion in limine 7 of the defense, which is Government Exhibit 52, I got supplemental briefing on that; supplemental briefing on a few exemplars of co-conspirator statements; the remaining disclosed defense experts perhaps, so we'll discuss that. I have a few other things just to tick off the list, and go over logistics for Monday, and take your questions or hear your issues.\n2 Ms. Comey, anything before we get underway?\n3 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. We do have a few issues to raise. The first is that unfortunately I do think we will need to ask for a briefing schedule to preclude cross-examination on certain topics of government witnesses.\n4 On Friday afternoon, the government conferred with defense counsel. We presented about a dozen topics that we believe are clearly improper topics for cross-examination. Yesterday defense counsel told us that they're not in a position to tell us that they will not cross on any of those topics. Because there are many of them and because they include things like criminal convictions that are beyond the scope of 609 and other personal information that might either identify anonymized witnesses or embarrass witnesses, we would ask to be able to submit briefing rather than raise those issues on the public record.\n5 THE COURT: You can, but not until you have further discussion and narrow disputes, because that's going to happen.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
