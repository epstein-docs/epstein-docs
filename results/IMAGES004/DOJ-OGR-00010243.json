We would just propose asking parallel questions about the questions he was asked in person, in particular because the juror was asked during voir dire similar questions about questions of bias for or against the government, impartiality. And so to clarify the record, whether he took answering those questions in person seriously and answered truthfully. MS. STERNHEIM: Could we have a moment? THE COURT: You may. (Pause) MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think there was several areas of follow-up here that are warranted. First, the juror made some reference to his healing process. I couldn't quite understand what he said at the time, something about how he views himself as a victim or not as a victim of a crime. I think we need to understand his healing process and what he has gone through, because that affects his ability to be an impartial juror in a case involving sexual abuse. Is this something that he still is seeking treatment for? Is this something he is still thinking? How he deals with the healing process and how he thinks about himself as a victim affects how he views the victim witnesses in this case, and I think there ought to be more questions about that.
