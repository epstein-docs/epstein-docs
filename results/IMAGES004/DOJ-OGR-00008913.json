Juror 50 Motion to Intervene\n\nThe Court is also in receipt of Juror 50's motion to intervene, which both the Government and the Defense oppose.

Juror 50 cites no authority to support a juror's intervention when he will possibly be subject to a post-verdict inquiry. The cases he cites in support are inapposite; he is not seeking to intervene to assert First Amendment access by the press, to quash a subpoena, or to prevent dissemination of privileged information.\n\nAlthough cases do support that a juror should have legal counsel in a post-verdict inquiry into allegedly false voir dire responses, as Juror 50 does have, no cases support intervention.
