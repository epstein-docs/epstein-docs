According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein who interacted with \"Jane\" and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as manager of Epstein's properties in the mid-late 1990s - e.g., Juan Alessi in Palm Beach and various unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had some role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David Rodgers, who transported \"Jane\" on Epstein's private planes. But these people had no knowledge of the criminal conduct and do not qualify as criminally responsible participants for the purposes of the aggravating role enhancement.\nSimilarly, there is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Apart from Epstein, Sarah Kellen was the only other person identified in the trial record as a criminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Among other things, Carolyn testified that Sarah Kellen scheduled massage appointments for her and took nude pictures of her at the Palm Beach residence on one occasion. (Tr. 1527-28; 1538-39). The record is clear, however, that Ms. Maxwell did not supervise Sarah Kellen. Rather, Kellen was hired by Epstein as his assistant to replace Ms. Maxwell and take over responsibility for scheduling massage appointments and other property management tasks at a time when Ms. Maxwell was moving on from Epstein and was no longer actively managing the day-to-day affairs of his residences.\nFor example, Kimberly Espinosa testified that Kellen was hired sometime between 2000-2002 to be Epstein's assistant and that she, and not Sarah Kellen, was Ms. Maxwell's assistant from when she was hired in 1996 up through the end of her employment in 2002.
