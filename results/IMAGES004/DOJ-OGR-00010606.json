From the very first conversation, I was emphatic that Ghislaine was the true enabler and facilitator of my abuse.\n\nIt has been proven to be true for me (and for many survivors of this kind of grooming and insidious abuse with whom I have spoken), that the experience of looking at my own baby girl and imagining her falling victim to such atrocities, awakened compassion in me for myself as a young girl and for the many, many others who suffered because of Ghislaine Maxwell. It was this experience that fueled a call to action.\n\nIt was the very skilled grooming, perpetrated on me, intentionally and consistently, that instilled in me, the belief that I could not say no to Ghislaine Maxwell, or Epstein.\n\nI witnessed on numerous occasions, over many years, Ghislaine Maxwell trying to recruit other girls and making consistent and insistent demands on me and others to do the same.\n\nI witnessed her relentless and insatiable drive to meet the sexual needs of Epstein, at any cost to the vulnerable girls and women, upon whom she preyed and fed to Epstein and other powerful men, to whom she wished to ingratiate herself.\n\nThere was never any ambiguity or doubt about her having full knowledge of what was to take place once she recruited girls.\n\nThe many acts that were perpetrated on me by Epstein, including sexual assault, were never consensual, and would have never occurred, had it not been for the cunning and premeditated role Ghislaine Maxwell played.\n\nShe repeatedly reinforced rewards for acquiescence and consequences for disobedience.\n\nBeing around her was like being spun really fast in a circle and then trying to maintain balance. It was like a roller coaster ride, designed to disorient and disempower me as a vulnerable, young girl, for the sole purpose of providing me to Epstein for sexual abuse.\n\nThe best way to imprison someone, is to make them create the prison bars in their own mind, to instill enough fear to make sure they never risk leaving or disobeying and make the bars invisible to everyone, so that no one can see their cage, or hear their silent screams.\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00010606",
