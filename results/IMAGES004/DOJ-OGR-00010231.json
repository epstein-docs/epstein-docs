In responding to this question, did you answer no so as to make it more likely that you would be selected for the jury?\n3 A. Absolutely not, your Honor.\n4 Q. Did your history of sexual abuse motivate you in any way to try to tailor your answers to make it more likely that you would be selected for this jury?\n5 A. Not at all, your Honor.\n6 Q. At the time you filled out the questionnaire on November 4, did it occur to you that you might personally benefit in any way from being on the jury in this case?\n7 A. Not at all, your Honor.\n8 Q. I'm going to return to question 25 again, which you have indicated was inaccurately responded to, and again you've discussed this, but I want to just hear directly in response to this question, why did you check no?\n9 A. Well, again, I wasn't thinking about abuse. I don't really think about my abuse really much anymore because it doesn't define me, it doesn't make me who I am today. It's something that happened, it's an experience that I lived through, and I have become the person I am today because of my goals and ambitions. And I do not feel that I am a victim of a crime, even though looking back on this abuse, that does make me a victim of a crime, which is why I should have marked yes for self.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00010231",
