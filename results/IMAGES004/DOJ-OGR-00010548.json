Annie did not want to go to New Mexico after Epstein had caressed and held Annie's hand and rubbed her foot and leg while watching a movie at a theater in New York in December 1995. (PSR ¶ 48). Despite those misgivings, Annie felt more comfortable going to New Mexico once she understood that the defendant, a grown woman in a romantic relationship with Epstein, would be there with Annie. (PSR ¶ 49). Yet, when Annie found herself alone at Epstein's ranch in New Mexico with just Epstein and the defendant, she found that the defendant was anything but a protector. (PSR ¶ 50). Instead, Annie found that the purpose of the trip was to groom her for sexual abuse.\nDuring the New Mexico trip, the defendant took steps to normalize sexual contact under the ruse of massage. The defendant asked Annie if she had ever had a professional massage, and said that she wanted Annie to have that experience and that she would be happy to give Annie a massage. (PSR ¶ 52). After telling Annie to get undressed, the defendant gave Annie a massage on a massage table while Annie was naked. (Id.). During the massage, the defendant rubbed Annie's body and directed Annie to roll over so that Annie was laying on her back. (Id.). After Annie complied and rolled to her back, the defendant pulled the sheet down and exposed Annie's breasts. (Id.). Then, while Annie was naked and isolated on a ranch in the middle of nowhere, the defendant rubbed Annie's breasts. (Id.). Annie testified that she wanted “badly to get off of the table and have this massage be done.” (Id.). The defendant sexually abused a teenage girl in an effort to groom her for further abuse.\nFollowing through on that plan on this same New Mexico trip, Epstein later got into Annie's bed, cuddled with her, pressed his body into her, and rubbed against her.
