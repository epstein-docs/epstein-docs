For example, during the voir dire inquiry of Juror 189, after directing the prospective juror to a blank version of the questionnaire, the Court's examination on this subject was as follows:\nTHE COURT: Based on your response, what I want to ask is if there is anything about what you describe here that would interfere in any way with your ability to be fair and impartial here?\nJUROR: No.\n(Nov. 17, 2021 Tr. at 532:11-18). Similarly, the following is the voir dire inquiry of Juror 239, who answered \"yes\" to Question 48:\nTHE COURT: The first tab is just a blank version of the questionnaire that you filled out. If you turn to page 24, question 48. Do you recall your response to question 48?\nJUROR: Yes.\nTHE COURT: Anything about that experience, in light of what I have told you about this case, that would interfere in any way with your ability to be fair to both sides?\nJUROR: There is nothing there.\n(Nov. 18, 2021 Tr. at 634:25-635:8). These jurors were not asked any further questions about their experiences as victims of sexual abuse, and they were qualified as jurors without objection from either party. Thus, while the defendant claims that Juror 50's responses to the questionnaire deprived the Court of the opportunity to conduct a probing voir dire examination of Juror 50 regarding his views about the defense's theories in this case, the record proves otherwise.
