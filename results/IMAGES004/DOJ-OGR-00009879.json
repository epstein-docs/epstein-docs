Juror No. 50 would have been asked to explain what happened to him as a child and the impact it had on him. He would have been asked if his own traumatic, scarring, and life-changing abuse would make him more sympathetic towards the accusers in this case and less sympathetic towards Ms. Maxwell. He would have been probed about any claimed ability to be fair and impartial.\nOf course, everyone wants to believe that they can be fair and impartial and can set aside any bias they may have based on their prior experiences, but we know that this is difficult, if not impossible for any human to do. Regardless of Juror No. 50's answers to questions about his purported ability to disregard his own childhood victimization, Ms. Maxwell would have challenged Juror No. 50 for cause and, consistent with other prospective juror challenges, the request would have been granted by the Court.\nAssuming Juror No. 50 recounted any of his beliefs during jury selection, subsequently disclosed by him in the media—such as the abusive event is like a video and victims remember the event accurately—there is no doubt a challenge would have been made, unopposed, and granted.\nNow, after having been alerted by the government that he may be in trouble, Juror No. 50 has predictably, either with the assistance of counsel or simple common sense, attempted to disavow his earlier comments and actions, going to great lengths to stress his now claimed ignorance of the questions and his ability to be fair.\nIf we, the lawyers and jurist in this matter, are being truthful, the essential facts surrounding this issue are not really subject to dispute: (1) whether a prospective juror suffered childhood sexual abuse was a material fact; (2) Juror No. 50 was (or claims to be) a victim of\n5\nDOJ-OGR-00009879",
