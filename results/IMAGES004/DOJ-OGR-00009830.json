Applicable Law\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” United States v.

This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that constitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrefutable because if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the scope of the hearing must be narrowly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the inquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the opportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v.
