We notified the defense in a letter that it was available for inspection. The defense asked for an inspection the week before our conference on November 1st. I made it available for inspection that day. They personally inspected it. We're happy to continue to make that available for inspection to the defense.\n\n8 THE COURT: I'm very happy to hear that. Thank you. I appreciate that. And I think that takes care of that for now.\n\n11 I guess one question: I think, given the uncertainty as to admission, the government should not mention it in its opening.\n\n14 MS. MOE: Of course, your Honor. Thank you.\n\n15 THE COURT: Anything before we move on?\n\n16 MR. PAGLIUCA: No, your Honor. Thank you.\n\n17 THE COURT: So next is the admissibility of co-conspirator statements. I do appreciate the efforts to come to reasonable agreement, of course, with the defense preserving objections as to ultimate admissibility. Based on the law, of course the government has to make the showing that's required during the course of the trial.\n\n23 There are two statements that are exemplars that remain in issue, and I think, starting with the second one first: so the second one, it seems to me, is not being offered\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
