Do you think it was before the July 15th conference call with the Court? A. I did not see it before the July 15th conference call with the Court. Q. Do you think it was before you filed your July 21st letter? A. Yes, it was. Q. You were not on the July 15th conference call, correct? A. That's correct. Q. You saw a transcript of the conference call? A. Ms. Trzaskoma let me know about it immediately after that, and I also read the transcript when it became available. Q. Approximately when was that? Was that before you filed your July 21st letter? A. Oh, yes, within a day. Q. You're accustomed to get daily or -- in other words, this was not an instance where you ordered like a 30-day-out transcript? A. Oh, no. We had to respond, so I read the transcript to make sure that I knew what Judge Pauley was directing us to do. Q. At the point at which you saw those emails, Ms. Brune, at the very least you knew that Ms. Trzaskoma's statements to the Court in that conference call were not correct? A. I disagree. Q. Did she reveal to the Court what she knew? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00009357",
