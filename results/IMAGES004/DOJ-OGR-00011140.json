Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2017). To determine whether an expert's method is reliable, the Court considers the non-exhaustive list provided by the Supreme Court in Daubert, including whether the expert's method has been tested, whether it has been subjected to peer review, the rate of error, standards controlling the method's operation, and whether the method is accepted by the expert community. United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d 259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 593–94 (1993)).\n\nBut Rule 702 ultimately sets a \"liberal\" and \"permissive\" standard of admissibility. Nimely v. City of New York, 414 F.3d 381, 395–96 (2d Cir. 2005). In particular, not every expert admissible under Daubert need rely on a method that conforms with \"the exactness of hard science methodologies.\" E.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., No. 07-CV-8383 (LAP), 2010 WL 3466370, at *13–14 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2010) (quoting United States v. Simmons, 470 F.3d 1115, 1123 (5th Cir. 2006)).\n\nAdditionally, the procedure for disclosing expert witnesses is governed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16. That rule states that when the Government makes a request, the Defense \"must . . . give to the government a written summary of any testimony that the defendant intends to use under Rules 702. . . . This summary must describe the witness's opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness's qualifications.\" Fed. R.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-00011140",
