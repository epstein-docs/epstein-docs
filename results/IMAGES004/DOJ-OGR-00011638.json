I think, from what I see, it's a close question. It's going to turn on the testimony. So I'll allow that testimony to take place. I'll allow voir dire. And then I'll make a ruling, depending on how that goes, as to whether it meets the threshold for admissibility, and the questions that have been raised go to weight. But as I sit here, I don't know until I hear that testimony.\n\nI do think that the government needs to make it available for inspection to the defense, and so you'll work out the logistics of that pretrial. To the extent that they want a forensic expert to look at it, a document forensic expert to look at it, you'll work out the logistics to make it available. OK?\n\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: Any questions about that?\n\nMR. PAGLIUCA: No, your Honor, other than one of my requests was that the actual document be here at trial and not a photocopy of one page.\n\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. The actual exhibit will be here in the courtroom at trial. And we have already made that exhibit available for the defense for inspection. They have personally inspected it, I believe that was on November 1st.\n\nTHE COURT: Great. I'm happy to hear that. And not just the page but the whole book.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
