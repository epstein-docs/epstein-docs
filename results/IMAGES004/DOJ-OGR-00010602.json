McCawley Telephone: (954) 356-0011 Email: smccawley@bsfllp.com June 22, 2022 The Honorable Alison J. Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: I am counsel for Annie Farmer, and I am providing the following victim impact statement for the Court's consideration with respect to Maxwell's sentencing. Pursuant to the Crimes Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Annie Farmer qualifies as a victim and was a testifying witness during the trial. Ms. Farmer thus requests the Court's permission to make an oral statement at the sentencing. Statement by Annie Farmer: Judge Nathan, For a long time, I wanted to erase from my mind the crimes that Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein committed against me and pretend they hadn't happened. Beyond my initial description to my boyfriend and family of what occurred when I was with them in New Mexico, I didn't talk about it for years. It was the type of dark memory that feels safest to keep locked away, and so I did the best I could. The world did not cooperate with this strategy, however. Something would bring to mind this experience and my body would respond with an upset stomach and physical shakiness. I'd feel irritable, have trouble focusing, and feel disoriented. In recent years, I have been asked repeatedly to describe these crimes to law enforcement and the media, and I have learned heartbreaking details about the ways Maxwell and Epstein abused and exploited so many others. Focusing on these experiences that I tried so hard to avoid thinking about has forced me to acknowledge the many ripple effects of their crimes for myself and my family and the continued impact of these long-ago events on my life. One of the most painful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein's abuse was a loss of trust in myself, my perceptions, and my instincts. When predators groom and then abuse or exploit children and other vulnerable people, they are, in a sense, training them to distrust BOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP 401 East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 1200, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301 | (t) 954 356 0011 | (f) 954 356 0022 | www.bsfflp.com DOJ-OGR-00010602",
