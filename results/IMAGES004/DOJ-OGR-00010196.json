Conclusion\n\nIn her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have been imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin's Am. Sentencing Mem. 13-16, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this case different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing trades. Indeed, to our knowledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins and other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and he is the only one who stands convicted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010196",
