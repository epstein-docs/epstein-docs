Carolyn further testified that she had trouble remembering details of the events in question and affirmed that she \"[doesn't] remember the times and dates\" of her visits to Epstein's Palm Beach residence. (Tr. 1525, 1559).\n\nThe government asserts that Carolyn's recollection can be credited because even if she cannot recall the year that an event took place, she has been consistent about how old she was when the event took place. (PSR at 53). As set forth above, this claim is flatly contradicted by the record. If Carolyn could not accurately remember how old she was when she first met Epstein, the Court should not credit her recollection of how old she was when she last saw him.\n\nCarolyn's memory of when she stopped seeing Epstein was not only unreliable, but also contradicted by the other evidence in the record. Carolyn herself testified that her last interactions with Epstein were when she returned from Georgia after giving birth to her son on March 14, 2004. (Tr. 1548-49). Carolyn stated that she went back to Epstein \"four or five times\" because she needed money to buy things for her son, but eventually gave up when it became clear that she was too old for Epstein.
