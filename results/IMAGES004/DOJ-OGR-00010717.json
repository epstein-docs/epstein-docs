I never lost the weight, my application was never good enough, and it never got submitted.\n\nI thank Almighty God that, in 2007, I managed to escape the horror by fleeing for my life to the UK.\n\nSince then, I have been coping with the daily all-consuming fear that someday Epstein and Maxwell would harm me, my loved ones and my family, as Epstein repeatedly told me would happen, if I ever dared to leave.\n\nI frequently experience flashbacks and wake up in a cold sweat from nightmares reliving the awful experience. I am hypervigilant, experience dramatic mood changes, and avoid certain places, situations and people. I will sometimes start crying uncontrollably and without apparent reason. I have worked hard with several mental health professionals who have diagnosed me with extreme symptoms of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, PTSD, and tendencies to self-harm.\n\nDespite my earnest effort, I have not realized my God-given potential professionally or entered healthy personal relationships. I have never married and do not have children, something I always wished for, even as a little girl. I shy away from strangers and have difficulty making new friends because I fear they could be associated with Epstein, Maxwell and the enablers.\n\nTo this day, I attend AA meetings, but I have had numerous relapses and know that only by the grace of God do I continue to live. I have attempted suicide twice since the abuse—both near-fatal.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00010717",
