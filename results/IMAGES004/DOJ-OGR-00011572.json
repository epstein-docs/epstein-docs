  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 737 Filed 07/22/22 Page 53 of 101 53 M6SQmax1 information about the status of the estate. With respect to whether this information should be in the PSR, I think the Court is exactly right. This is listed on an asset on her balance sheet. Whether she ultimately recovers that amount or not, it's listed in the same way that liabilities are listed even though it may be uncertain as to how those are resolved. So I don't think the objection is founded. THE COURT: Yes, I'm going to overrule this objection to the PSR paragraph. It is included as an asset in Ms. Maxwell's financial aid affidavit. The uncertain assertion that she may lose the asset is not a basis to exclude it from a considered asset for purposes of determining a fine. Paragraph 178, the assertion here is that she is unable to pay a fine. Do I have that right, Mr. Everdell? MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: I overrule the objection. Section 5E1.2(a) of the Guidelines requires the Court to impose a fine in all cases except where the defendant establishes that she is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine. The defendant has failed to establish this. As I just noted, there is a $10 million bequest from Epstein this is in addition to other assets noted in the PSR. I will say the assets and finances have been a moving target. In July 2020, Ms. Maxwell reported $3.8 million in SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011572",
