The S2 Indictment, which the government filed after it had located and interviewed Carolyn, charged offense conduct that lasted \"up to and including in or about 2004.\" (S2 Ind. ¶¶ 11, 17, 23, 27). The expanded end date of the S2 Indictment was based solely on Carolyn's anticipated testimony and corroborating evidence.

The Court should hold the government to its allegations and not allow it to expand the end date of the offense conduct for purposes of sentencing. See United States v.
