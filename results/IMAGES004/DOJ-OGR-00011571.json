What is the current status of the bequest? MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, my understanding is that the document says what it says, and the estate is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. I don't believe there is any -- this issue has been addressed because I think the estate is still dealing with victims' claims and other claims against the estate. But because it's in bankruptcy, I assume that this will be contested, and we don't know if there will be any money left at the end of that proceeding to honor the bequest. So that's one of the many reasons why I think this is such a tenuous asset that it shouldn't be considered for purposes of fines. THE COURT: It's listed as an asset in the financial affidavit, is it not? MR. EVERDELL: It is, your Honor, because we felt we wanted to fully disclose everything we know about, and we do know about simply because we were produced that document. We didn't know about it before. We knew about it because we got it in discovery, and we saw it was there, so we felt in good faith, we had to list it or at least disclose it, but I don't think it should be considered for purposes of fine. THE COURT: Ms. Moe, do you want to respond to that? MS. MOE: Your Honor, I don't have additional SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011571",
