  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 663 Filed 06/15/22 Page 53 of 77 Ghislaine has managed to live through the most arduous pre-trial detention for over 500 days under an \"enhanced security schedule\" at MDC Brooklyn, with courage, humility and stoicism. During her pre-trial detention, she suffered conditions that have constantly and daily contravened the UN Mandela Rules of detention to which the US is a party. Examples highlighted by Ghislaine's counsel include \"severe sleep deprivation, a lack of potable water, prison computers that do not function and inability to access the Prosecution discovery or keep jail guards from reviewing her confidential materials.\" I am in awe of the depth of her life force and forbearance. This shows me that she will be able to emerge from incarceration with fortitude and magnanimity. I conclude this letter with a reiteration of the government's and the Court's own repeated assertions that Ghislaine is no threat to society; and in restating my strongest belief that Ghislaine would bring all her deep and demonstrated qualities to bear again to help society. I hope greatly that she will be given the opportunity to do so sooner rather than later. Yours respectfully, Isabel Maxwell Isabel Maxwell DOJ-OGR-00010499",
