Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: The Government respectfully submits this motion to preclude certain testimony of certain defense witnesses. After reviewing the defendant's witness list and related material, it appears that certain witnesses are expected to testify about matters that are irrelevant, prejudicial, or improper impeachment. Specifically, the Government moves to preclude the following: - Testimony from Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly Bovino about whether they participated in a sexualized massage with Jane; - Testimony from Alexander Hamilton as contained in the affidavit attached as Exhibit A; - Testimony from Dr. Loftus about suggestive activities that did not occur in this case; 1 DOJ-OGR-00011253",
