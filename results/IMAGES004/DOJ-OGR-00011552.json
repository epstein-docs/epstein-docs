If you look at Larry Visoski's testimony, which I believe is what the government is relying on there, he originally testified, oh, I think she was an assistant for both. But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really didn't know what her role was, and his best recollection was that she was an assistant for Epstein. And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's testimony who was the actual assistant for Ms. Maxwell, and she says unequivocally, \"I was her assistant. Kellen was Epstein's assistant.\" So there is no fair inference that Ms. Maxwell was supervising Sarah Kellen. The inference is exactly the opposite, and it can't provide a basis for that leadership enhancement. THE COURT: All right. Anything further on the enhancements for the government's objection? MS. MOE: Your Honor, just very briefly with respect to the leadership question, I just want to direct the Court's attention, we noted this on page 27 of our brief, but the testimony at trial was that Carolyn recalled that even after Sarah Kellen took over calling to schedule massages, Maxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage appointments.
