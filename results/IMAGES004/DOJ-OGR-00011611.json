  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 737 Filed 07/22/22 Page 92 of 101 92 M6s2Max2 The sentence I impose must reflect the gravity of Ms. Maxwell's conduct, of Ms. Maxwell's offense, the pivotal role she played in facilitating the offense, and the significant and lasting harm it inflicted. So, too, must the sentence promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and afford adequate deterrence. As I have described, this scheme was long-lasting, it was far-reaching, it was horribly damaging to the victims. Just punishment and promotion of respect for the law, it demands a substantial sentence that meets the scope of the conduct and the scope of the harm. Moreover, general deterrence is critically important to the sentence I will impose. A substantial sentence will send an unmistakable message that those who engage in and facilitate the sexual abuse and trafficking of underaged victims will be held accountable by the law. As the probation department stated, a significant sentence should promote general deterrence against the exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, and I fully agree. But let me be clear that Ms. Maxwell is wealthy or that this case is high profile is not a basis for increasing punishment in any regard, but the rule of law demands, and this Court must ensure that, whether you are rich or poor, powerful or entirely unknown, nobody is above the law. That message serves the important interest in SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011611",
