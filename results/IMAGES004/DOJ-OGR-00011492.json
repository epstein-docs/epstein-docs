Do I have to stay pending litigation or dismiss my lawsuit in order to participate in the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program?\nNo. If you have filed litigation against Jeffrey Epstein and/or the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein and/or related individuals and entities, you do not need to stay the litigation or make any other concession in a pending litigation in order to participate in the Program. Litigation may continue during the processing of your claim in the Program. Likewise, if you have not yet filed a lawsuit, you remain free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. You will, however, need to provide the Program with information about the litigation, including the case number, venue and date where the case was filed.\nIf the Administrator determines that you are eligible to receive compensation, and issues you a compensation determination letter, you will have the freedom to determine whether to accept the offered compensation. If you choose to accept the offered compensation, you must dismiss with prejudice any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate and/or related entities and individuals set forth in the Release in order to receive payment.\n4. I previously entered into a settlement agreement with Epstein and/or the Estate. Can I participate in the Program? Do I have to submit a copy of the settlement agreement to the Program? (Added July 28, 2020)\nClaimants who previously entered into a settlement agreement with Epstein and/or his Estate are not precluded from participating in the Program. The Administrator will, however, consider the prior settlement in evaluating the claim, as set forth in the Protocol. In order to do so, the Program must obtain and review a copy of the settlement agreement. The Administrator recognizes impacted Claimants' concerns that providing a copy of the settlement agreement to the Program could constitute a breach of the terms of the agreement. To address those concerns, the Estate has agreed to produce a copy of the Claimant's settlement agreement to the Program provided that the Claimant, or counsel acting on the Claimant's behalf, consents in writing to the Estate's production of the agreement to the Program for purposes of the Administrator's evaluation of the claim. The Estate has also agreed that it will waive any objection to, and will not assert a claim because of, a Claimant providing a copy of the settlement agreement to the Program for purposes of the Administrator's evaluation of the claim.\nIII. Claims Submission and Claims Process\n1. How do I obtain a Claim Form?\n- If you have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Jeffrey Epstein and/or the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein and/or related entities and individuals, 5 | P a g e\nDOJ-OGR-00011492",
