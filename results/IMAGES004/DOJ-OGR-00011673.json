Just to be able\n2 to see the binder before it's passed out to jurors, because they'll\n3 have a binder full of paper and be flipping through it to turn to exhibits. We just want to have chance to lay eyes\n5 on that binder in an abundance of caution. I've note that we\n6 have done the same; we've provided defense counsel with a copy\n7 of the binders that we plan to hand out.\n8 THE COURT: Can you come closer to the mic please.\n9 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n10 I would just note that we've done the same; we've\n11 provided defense counsel with a copy of the binders that we\n12 intend to pass out to the jurors so they can examine it.\n13 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, what we would like to do is\n14 follow the practice of this Court that it's been doing forever,\n15 as far as I know, which is that before we show anything to the\n16 witness, we will show it to the government and we will show it\n17 to the Court and the Court's deputy so that they can see what\n18 we are showing to the witness. But we do not want to give them\n19 a whole binder of cross materials before the cross begins.\n20 THE COURT: All right. That's fine. But in that\n21 case, we won't place the binder with the jury --\n22 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine.\n23 THE COURT: -- in advance.\n24 MR.
