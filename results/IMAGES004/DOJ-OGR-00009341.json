So the three of us were together and Ms. Trzaskoma said\n5 something to me along these lines: You know, I'm starting to\n6 wonder in light of the juror note whether this Juror No. 1\n7 could be the same person as this suspended lawyer.\n8 And Ms. Edelstein said, \"Well, what did she say in\n9 voir dire?\" And Theresa reminded us of the stay at home wife\n10 and the education and the other aspects of the voir dire and\n11 she reminded us that this person had some kind of a personal\n12 injury suit in the Bronx.
