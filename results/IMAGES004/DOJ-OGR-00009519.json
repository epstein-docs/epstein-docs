United States, 552 U.S. 38 (2007), the Supreme Court emphasized that a non-incarcerative sentence does not mean \"letting an offender off easily.\" The Court wrote:\nWe recognize that custodial sentences are qualitatively more severe than probationary sentences of equivalent terms. Offenders on probation are nonetheless subject to several standard conditions that substantially restrict their liberty. Probationers may not leave the judicial district, move, or change jobs without notifying, and in some cases receiving permission from, their probation officer or the court. They must report regularly to their probation officer, permit unannounced visits to their homes, refrain from associating with any person convicted of a felony, and refrain from excessive drinking. Most probationers are also subject to individual \"special conditions\" imposed by the court.\nId. at 59.\nDOJ-OGR-00009519",
