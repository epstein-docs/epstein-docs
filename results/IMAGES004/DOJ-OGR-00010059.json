And it was sort of lying\n10  there right on the surface, that if you Google it, it comes up.\n11  And that's why I said to the Court that I assumed it was going\n12  to come up. But I didn't think I was supposed to make\n13  arguments if the government wasn't going to make it.\n14      It would have been a different matter if we had\n15  knowledge. We didn't know. I didn't think it was a\n16  meritorious argument or an issue that in any way undercut the\n17  application that we made.

But the government clearly Googled her at the\n23  point that they received the letter. So it was not like it was\n24  some mysterious thing that one can conduct a Google search on\n25  this juror.
