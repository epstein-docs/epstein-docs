For one, I have responsive briefing on the legal issues, and so really what we're talking about is argument following based on today's record.\nOne week from today, the 15th. Simultaneous briefing, I don't care if you call it letter briefing or otherwise. As you know, all I care is that it's double-spaced so I can read it on my iPad. Fifteen pages max per side.\nAnything else from the government?\nMS. POMERANTZ: No, your Honor. Thank you.\nMS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, I would just request that our submission of questions which was sent to chambers be made a part of this record.\nTHE COURT: Yes. As I've said, I will docket everything. There's identifying information of Juror 50 in your submitted questions. So that needs to be redacted.\nBut other than Juror 50 identifying information, the redactions for all materials, I believe, for all materials based on the post-trial briefing and the submitted questions can be publicly docketed.\nIs that correct? As well as my opinion had two lines of redactions. So I'll docket my opinion without redactions.\nI'll ask the parties to -- actually, I think we can handle the submitted questions, the redactions for identifying information.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00010264",
