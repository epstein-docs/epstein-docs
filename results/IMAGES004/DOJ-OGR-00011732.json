  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 741 Filed 08/10/22 Page 67 of 106 80 LBTVMAX3 Opening - Ms. Sternheim Now, like many of the other accusers, but even more startling here, Carolyn's story changed dramatically. Back in around 2007, she was interviewed by the FBI about Epstein. She did not have a lawyer at that time, but she answered their questions. And later, she hired an attorney and sued Epstein and his assistant, Sarah Kellen. She did not sue Ghislaine. She then brought another lawsuit in federal court in Florida. Again, she sued Epstein and Kellen. She did not sue Ghislaine. Ghislaine had not come up during that interview in 2007. Ghislaine was not identified as anyone who recruited Carolyn or groomed Carolyn or otherwise interacted with Carolyn in Palm Beach. As I said, two suits by Carolyn, none involved Ghislaine. You will see the length of the complaint against Epstein and Kellen. It doesn't include Ghislaine. Now, the evidence will also show that Carolyn actually groomed and trafficked other people to Epstein. And after Epstein died and there was money to be had, her lawyer contacted the government, and now her story included Ghislaine. And assisting the government enhanced her application to the fund, and she got three and a half million dollars, less the 40 or $50,000 that she had received in one of her lawsuits against Epstein and Kellen. Now, early on, the judge told you that the burden is on the government to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011732",
