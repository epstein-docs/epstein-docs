What is the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program?\n\nThe Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the \"Epstein VCP\" or \"Program\") is a voluntary, independent Program that has been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. The Program was designed by nationally recognized claims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H Feldman, with input from victims' lawyers, and representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (\"Estate\"), and other interested parties. Ms. Feldman also serves as the Administrator of the Program (\"Administrator\"). The goal of this Program is to acknowledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and offer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\n\nThe Program is independent of the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submitted to the Program. The Administrator has complete autonomy to determine eligibility of individual claims and the amount of compensation for each eligible Claimant. The Estate has no authority to modify or reject any individual claim determinations rendered by the Administrator, or otherwise interfere with the administration of the Program.\n\nThe terms and conditions of the Program, including the criteria and proof requirements for the evaluation and determination of claims and the accompanying claims process, are set forth in the Program Protocol (\"Protocol), which can be found on the Program website.\n\n2. Is the Program voluntary?\n\nYes. The Program is a non-adversarial alternative to litigation, and participation in the Program is entirely voluntary. It does not affect any rights you may have unless and until you accept the offered compensation and execute a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.\n\n3. What role does the Estate play in the administration of the Program?\n\nThe Program is independent of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Estate has no role in the evaluation of claims or the administration of the claims process. The Administrator has full, final and exclusive decision-making authority to determine who is eligible and the amount of compensation for each eligible\n\n3 | Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-00011490",
