Do I understand correctly that she generally was not involved in the litigation of this matter on trial? 2 A. She helps out. She helped me certainly with the closing statement, but you're right, she was not on the trial team. 3 Q. She generally did not appear at court appearances, though, is that correct? 4 A. That's correct. 5 Q. And you've had many trials, both in your government experience and your experience as private counsel, correct? 6 A. You know, I've had three trials as a defense lawyer. So I don't know if that would qualify as many. But I certainly have handled quite a few between work in the government and work on the defense. 7 Q. And I take it that when you were an assistant you also conducted many Grand Jury investigations, correct? 8 A. Many. 9 Q. And you know that an important part of any Grand Jury investigation are the details, correct? 10 A. That's certainly so. 11 Q. And you know how to pay attention to details, is that correct? 12 A. I try very hard to pay attention to detail. 13 Q. And I take it that you would agree that you were vested in the success of you law firm, correct? 14 A. I am very vested, very proud of it.
