From his vantage point, he said, he had a vista of the entire court and the 'perfect view' of Maxwell herself. During the trial Scotty, who works in finance, was seated in the third row of the jury box, in the back corner. From his vantage point, he said, he had a vista of the entire court and the 'perfect view' of Maxwell herself. He recalled, 'I could literally see her [all the time]. There were times when it felt like she was staring right at me and we would lock eyes...it didn't feel real.' 'She was constantly taking notes, and constantly passing post-it notes over to her attorneys especially when they were on cross-examination.' At times, he said, 'I felt like she was watching what we were doing because there were times when some jurors, not during when the victims presented their testimony, but when certain other people presented on things that maybe they didn't feel mattered...some people would nod off.' Scotty said that Maxwell's manner in court was discussed during deliberations. He said, 'We did discuss that we thought she was a little standoffish and not necessarily cold, more like she was paying attention.' In an insight that will surely come as a gut blow to Maxwell herself, who reportedly wanted to testify but was advised against it, Scotty revealed that if she had taken the stand, 'It would have shown maybe that she was a little more human.' 'Maybe if she gave her version of the story, who knows, maybe if she gave us a story of how she was manipulated...I don't know. But then that would have been an admission I feel like of guilt.' Jurors were instructed not to draw any inference of guilt or otherwise from Maxwell's decision not to testify and, Scotty said, it was simply set to one side and not discussed during deliberations. Asked if, at any stage, he had experienced any sympathy for Maxwell he said, 'Absolutely. Because this is the rest of her life, right? We were deciding what happens based off the evidence provided.' 'We took that very seriously because we took at as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here. We have to really comb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she's either guilty or not.' David told The Independent he found all the accusers to be credible, despite the defence's attacks on their stories and memories. How Maxwell could claim a mistrial after juror reveals he was victim of child sex abuse and shared his experience with the jury Ghislaine Maxwell could lodge a claim of mistrial after it emerged one of the jurors who convicted her was a victim of child sex abuse. Scotty David said he had helped the other members of the jury understand things from a victim's point of view. He also claimed the five guilty verdicts returned last week, possibly condemning Maxwell to spend the rest of her life behind bars, were for 'all the victims'. David said that after he revealed his ordeal, another juror came forward with to share that they too had been sexually abused. Legal experts said that if David failed to disclose his past experiences before the jury deliberations, Maxwell could have grounds to claim a mistrial and have her convictions quashed. Moira Penza, a former federal prosecutor in New York, said: 'I certainly hope the juror disclosed this fully on his questionnaire.' 'A little strange the defence didn't strike him. It could definitely be an issue.' 'In the first instance it would likely form the basis for a motion to Judge [Alison] Nathan for a new trial.' However, the question of whether a potential juror was a victim of sexual abuse or a relative or friend of a victim was asked in the 50-question questionnaire completed by each juror ahead of selection. Scotty could not remember that question when asked by DailyMail.com but was certain that he had answered all questions honestly. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10370193/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html 5/16 DOJ-OGR-00009858",
