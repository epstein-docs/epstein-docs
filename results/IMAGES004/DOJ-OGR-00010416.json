Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nMay 11, 2022\nBy ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan, Sitting by Designation\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nSO ORDERED.\nThe Government respectfully moves for the exclusion of time for Counts Seven and Eight under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1), until June 28, 2022—the scheduled date of sentencing. Although the Government currently intends to move to dismiss these counts at sentencing, as it has previously stated (see Dkt. No. 574), the Government seeks this exclusion of time in an abundance of caution, so the Act does not preclude prosecution in the unlikely event an intervening development occurs between now and sentencing which causes the Government to reconsider that position. Such an exclusion promotes the ends of justice by obviating any need for the parties and the Court to prepare for a second trial which, barring unforeseen developments, will not occur. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A). Defense counsel consents to this exclusion.\nSO ORDERED.\nAlison J. Nathan\nU.S. Circuit Judge\nSitting by designation\n5/11/22\nDOJ-OGR-00010416",
