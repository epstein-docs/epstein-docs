The documents sought are inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 408.\n\nThe subpoena should also be quashed because the records sought are inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 408. Rule 17(c), in general, authorizes subpoenas returnable before trial, as well as subpoenas returnable at trial “to obtain impeachment material.” United States v. Donziger, No. 19-CR-561 (LAP), 2021 WL 1865376, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 10, 2021). The test set forth in Nixon “governs both varieties” of subpoenas. Donziger, 2021 WL 1865376, at *4. Under Nixon, the subpoena must “clear three hurdles: (1) relevancy; (2) admissibility; (3) specificity.” Nixon, 418 U.S. at 700. Here, Maxwell's subpoena fails, at a minimum, to clear the admissibility hurdle, because Rule 408 makes the documents sought largely, if not entirely, inadmissible.\n\nUnder Rule 408(a), evidence of accepting a valuable consideration to compromise a claim, as well as statements or conduct made in connection with negotiations about the claim, are “not admissible—on behalf of any party—either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction.” Fed. R. Evid. 408(a). Inadmissibility under Rule 408 provides a basis to quash a Rule 17(c) subpoena. See49 See Order, dated Feb. 16, 2021 (ECF No. 120), at 2 in Farmer v. Indyke, 19 Civ. 10475 (S.D.N.Y.); Order, dated Mar. 19, 2021 (ECF No. 102) ¶ 2, in Doe v. Indyke, 20 Civ. 484 (S.D.N.Y.).\n50 Ex. A ¶ 14 (Feldman Decl.).\n\nDOJ-OGR-00011462",
