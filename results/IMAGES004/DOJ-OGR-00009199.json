  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 616 Filed 02/24/22 Page 9 of 32\n\n***\n\nThis is a case where alleged child victims of sexual abuse delayed disclosure of their claimed abuse for many years. The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers about those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors and eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the juror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly aggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims' stories because of abuse suffered by the juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell's request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors on this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell's request to include additional questions on the written questionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would \"smoke out\" potential jurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present, I feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty. This is not just going to be a summary voir dire; it will be probing. . . . If a juror's going to lie and be dishonest, we will smoke that out.\n\nTr. 10/21/21 Hrg. at 26:12.\n\nAlthough given multiple opportunities to identify himself as a victim of child sexual abuse, Juror No. 50 failed to truthfully respond to very clear and pointed questions such as \"were you the victim of a crime\" and specifically, whether\n\nHave you or a friend or family member [have] ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 50 truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately challenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions. In the unlikely event this challenge was denied, Juror No. 50 would have been questioned, in camera,\n\n4\n\nDOJ-OGR-00009199",
