Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square, New York, NY 10007\n\nRE: LETTER IN SUPPORT OF GHISLAINE MAXWELL AT SENTENCING\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nMy name is Isabel Maxwell and I am one of Ghislaine Maxwell's older twin sisters. I am 71 years of age and have known Ghislaine all her life. I am a Graduate of Oxford University, cofounder of one of Silicon Valley's earliest search engines, and a Technology Pioneer of the World Economic Forum. I am of course aware of the charges of which she has been found guilty at jury trial. I have been present at every one of the pretrial and trial court days. Notwithstanding the jury's verdict, I continue to hold Ghislaine in the highest regard and I believe very strongly that she still has much of value to contribute in the world. I wish to share some things about my sister that speak to her character and to her values that I have personally witnessed throughout her life, including from the early 1990s right up to today.\n\nDespite a very tragic start to her life due to a fatal car crash suffered by our eldest brother which deprived Ghislaine of the immediate attention of our parents in her earliest years, I observed her grow up and become a lovely, witty, resourceful, scrupulous and trustworthy human being. Our parents taught us key values such as kindness, consideration, generosity, and an extremely hard work ethic. For example, from a very early age each of us had to learn and demonstrate what our father termed \"the 3 Cs:Consideration, Concentration and Conciseness\" and to\n\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00010497",
