Letter at 6 (\"[T]he agreement runs the risk of 'confusing the issue' and 'misleading the jury' by presenting a document from which the jury is asked to infer conclusions that range far beyond the evidence.\"). The jury will not be confused or misled by evidence that Kate could not have visited Ms. Maxwell at Kinnerton Street in 1994 because Ms. Maxwell did not purchase that home for another two years. In contrast, jurors will be misled if they don't learn that Kate testified to something that could not have happened. *** \"The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts.\" United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709 (1974) (\"We have elected to employ an adversary system of criminal justice in which the parties contest all issues before a court of law.
