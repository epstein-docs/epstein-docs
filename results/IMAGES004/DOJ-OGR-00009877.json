For all the reasons given in the motion and elaborated below, this Court should reject the government's attempt to cripple Ms. Maxwell's vindication of her constitutional right to a trial by a fair and impartial jury.\nThe Facts\nThe government's response relies heavily on the fact that several potential jurors who admitted to being victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or harassment were not excluded for case. That is nothing but misdirection.\nThose potential jurors admitted to being victims of conduct nothing like the alleged conduct in this case. For example, potential jurors said they were groped or harassed on the subway, harassed at work, or touched inappropriately in a social setting. Resp. at 4-5.\nJuror No. 50, by contrast, has now admitted to being the victim of child sexual abuse—the very same conduct at issue in this case. And he has also admitted to responding to that abuse in much the same way the alleged victims in this case responded—delaying disclosure, relying on memories that can be replayed like a video, etc. This Court should not be misled by the government's misleading comparisons.\n2 United States v.
