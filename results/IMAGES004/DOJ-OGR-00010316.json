STERNHEIM did not disclose that in response to Question 49, which asks whether a family member has ever been accused of sexual abuse. (Tr. 11-13). Juror 50 originally answered that \"no\" was an accurate response because he \"never considered them part of my family even when they lived with us for a few years.\" (Tr. 11). That response contradicted a response he gave only a few minutes earlier concerning Question 48, when he first described the abuse to the Court. There, he said he was abused by \"a family member, who is no longer part of the family.\" (Tr. 8). He then quickly changed his answer and returned to his familiar refrain that he \"flew threw\" the questionnaire and said he \"didn't even consider\" whether his stepbrother was a family member. (Tr. 11-12). He then admitted that the accurate answer would have been \"Yes (friend or family member) because his stepbrother was, in fact, a family member. (Tr. 12-13). Juror 50's shifting explanation for his answer to this question shows an intent to answer this question falsely. Fourth, Juror 50 made a tortured and thoroughly unbelievable attempt to reconcile his statement that he \"[doesn't] tell very many people\" about his abuse with his decision to speak publicly about his abuse to multiple international media outlets, including the British tabloids, and his decision to post on numerous social media accounts. As soon as he was confronted with the obvious inconsistency, he provided an unprompted and obviously rehearsed answer: \"I didn't lie in order to get on this jury and then go to the press and tell them about my abuse. It just ... it's a little illogical thinking about it, like if I lied deliberately I wouldn't have told a soul.\" (Tr. 22-23). The Court continued to press after his unresponsive answer. When asked if he thought about the fact that many people would learn about his sexual abuse, he responded \"No, I did not.\" (Tr. 23). He later added that he thought \"a little article about a juror giving their experience wouldn't be record-breaking or really in the news at all.\" (Tr. 42). That is absolute nonsense.
