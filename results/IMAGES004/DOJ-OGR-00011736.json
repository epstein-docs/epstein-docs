STERNHEIM: Until now, even though they got money from a fund, their words have been untested and unchallenged, and for the first time, they are being put to the test, whether they support the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. You have heard about the presumption of innocence. That is what every person charged with a crime is cloaked in. No jury can remove that unless the government proves each and every element of each count beyond a reasonable doubt and they won't be able to do that, they won't be able to meet their burden.
