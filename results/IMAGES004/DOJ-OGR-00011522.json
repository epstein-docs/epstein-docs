A through H -- I'm sorry -- A through I were a series of letters from friends and family members of Ms. Maxwell. J is a forensic psychiatric evaluation. And then I received by a later transmission date of June 26, 2022 a letter from an inmate at MDC related to Ms. Maxwell's assistance of other inmates with tutoring. I have the government's sentencing submission, which is dated June 22, 2022. With respect to victim impact statements, I have dated June 22, 2022 a victim impact statement from Annie Farmer. I have a victim impact statement from the witness who went by the name of Kate under my pseudonym order during trial. That I believe is undated. I have a statement dated June 22, 2022 from Virginia Roberts, or Giuffre. I have same date from Juliette Bryant, same date from Maria Farmer, same date from Teresa Helm. I also have undated statements from Sarah Ransome -- I apologize if I'm saying your name wrong -- and Elizabeth Stein. Counsel, is there anything else I should have in front of me for purposes of sentencing? MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim. MS. STERNHEIM: Other than the submissions that we made in connection with the CVRA, that is a complete record of SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00011522",
