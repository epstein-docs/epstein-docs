Salutric, 775 F.3d 948, 951-52 (7th Cir. 2015). In that case, the Seventh Circuit observed that \"[i]n arriving at an appropriate sentence, a sentencing judge necessarily must consider not only the offense of conviction but the defendant's broader criminal record and history.\" Id. at 951. This point follows from the rationale that \"[u]ncharged criminal acts (and the injuries inflicted upon the victims of those acts) have a bearing on whether the offense of conviction was an aberration or part of a larger pattern of criminal behavior, the likelihood of the defendant re-offending, and the need for specific deterrence.\" Id. See also United States v. Laraneta, 700 F.3d 983, 987 (7th Cir. 2012). The Seventh Circuit explained that the federal \"Criminal Code makes clear that '[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense, which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.'\" 775 at 952 (quoting 18 U.S.C. ยง 3661).\n\nThis Court should follow the same approach and hear from all victims of Maxwell's long-running and wide-ranging sex trafficking conspiracy.
