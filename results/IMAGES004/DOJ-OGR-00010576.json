  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 670 Filed 06/22/22 Page 41 of 55\nhere. The Court has seen firsthand the lifetime of harm that the defendant's crimes caused her victims. It was evident on the witness stand that the victims have carried the trauma of these crimes throughout their adulthood, and that the defendant's actions have forever altered the course of their lives. As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, victims of child sexual abuse suffer ongoing trauma:\nWe know that although all adverse events that occur during childhood can place children at higher risk for adverse outcomes, we know that among those, child sexual abuse in particular increases risk for a very, very high number of various health problems and mental health problems and also increases risk for the severity of those problems.\n(Tr. 741-42). That is true for all of the victims in this case.\nThe repeated sexual abuse that Jane experienced has had lasting effects. During the years of abuse, Jane felt hopeless and thought about physically hurting herself. (PSR ¶ 38). Jane continues to struggle with the abuse. As Jane explained at trial: \"It ruined my self-esteem, my self-worth,\" and it \"led me to not trust people.\" (Id.). She remarked: \"How do you navigate a healthy relationship with a broken compass? I didn't even understand what real love is supposed to look like.\" (Id.). Jane's pain was evident as she sobbed leaving the courtroom after her testimony.\nIn a letter7 to the Court in connection with sentencing, Annie explained: \"One of the most painful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein's abuse was a loss of trust in myself, my perceptions, and my instincts. When predators groom and then abuse or exploit children and other vulnerable people, they are, in a sense, training them to distrust themselves.\" She further\n7 The victim impact statements referenced in this submission have been provided to defense counsel in accordance with the Court's June 21, 2022 Order (Dkt. No. 668). Subject to the process outlined in the Court's Order, the statements will be publicly filed.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-00010576",
