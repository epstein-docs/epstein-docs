Yes.\n3 Q. Okay, and as a result of that discussion you decided what\n4 you would omit from the brief, correct?\n5 A. I wouldn't characterize it as omit.\n6 Q. Okay, let's just stop there. You and Susan Brune discussed\n7 the fact that you wouldn't include certain things you knew\n8 about before the juror note in your brief, yes or no?\n9 A. Yes.\n10 Q. So isn't that a decision that you made with Susan Brune\n11 about what you would omit from the brief, yes or no?\n12 A. Yes.\n13 Q. So when you answered my questions a few minutes ago when I\n14 asked you whether you decided with Susan Brune that you would\n15 omit something, you said no. Was that an untrue answer before?\n16 A. Well, I'm not sure if that was the exact question. I'm\n17 not -- I'm not trying to lie here or give you a hard time.\n18 These are difficult questions to answer. In looking back and\n19 trying to figure out what the process was for writing this\n20 brief, if I had to do it over again would I do it differently?\n21 Yes. In hindsight should we have dropped a footnote saying\n22 that we, you know, knew that there was a suspended lawyer with\n23 the same name? If I had to do it over again I would certainly\n24 do that. And I'm very sorry for any misimpression the brief\n25 has created.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00010091",
