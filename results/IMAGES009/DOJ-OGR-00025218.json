Formal interviews were not conducted as a part of this reconstruction to avoid interference with pending investigations by other Department of Justice components. A copy of the video is normally made by Special Investigative Staff following a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since the original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the beginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely limited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish converging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry.
