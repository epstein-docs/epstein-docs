I explained to defense counsel that our normal practice was to cut a check to the next-of-kin that we have on-file. However, given the circumstances and the discussion of Epstein's will in the media, I told defense counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me they would get back to me. I haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release the funds?\nThanks,\n(b)(6), (b)(7)(C)\nStaff Attorney\nCLC New York\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\n150 Park Row\nNew York, NY 10007\np: 646-836-(b)(6)\nf: 646-836-7665\n(b)(6), (b)(7)(C) 8/28/2019 9:57 AM >>>\nGood Morning,\nI/M Epstein # 76318-054 appeared on our SENTRY RELEASE report.
