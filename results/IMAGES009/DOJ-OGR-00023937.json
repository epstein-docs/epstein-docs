His attorney, [b(6), b(7)(C)] has represented him in the past, and represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state.\n\nWe're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we would be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you—is it at all possible to address this issue [b(6), b(7)(C)] can meet with his client this evening? I'm available anytime at [b(6), b(7)(C)] to discuss, if that's helpful, or [b(6), b(7)(C)] can also be reached directly at [b(6), b(7)(C)] if that's easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you could please just let me know afterward I'd be grateful).\n\nthanks very much,\n[b(6), b(7)(C)]",
