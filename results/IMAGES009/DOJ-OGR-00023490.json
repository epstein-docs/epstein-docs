BOP policy also requires SHU staff to ensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system.

The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing operational challenges that negatively affect the BOP's ability to operate its institutions safely and securely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures, and widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during this investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP's most high profile inmates.\n\nNo Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with Epstein's Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP personnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein's death was the result of criminal conduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein's death and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not uncover evidence contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in connection with Epstein's death.\n\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in the report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP's custody was provided with the opportunity to take his own life. The BOP's failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death and effectively deprived Epstein's numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\n\nThe DOJ OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP's management of its correctional institutions. The BOP agreed with all recommendations.\n\nReport: Today's report and an interactive timeline of events can be found on the OIG's website at the following link: https://oig.justice.gov/reports/investigation-and-review-federal-bureau-prisons-custody-care-and-supervision-jeffrey\n\nVideo: To accompany today's report, the OIG has released a 3-minute video of the Inspector General discussing the report's findings.
