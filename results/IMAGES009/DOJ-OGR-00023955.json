He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state.\n\nWe're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we would be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you—is it at all possible to address this issue so [b](6) (b)(7)(C) can meet with his client this evening? I'm available anytime at [b](6) to discuss, if that's helpful, or [b](6) (b)(7)(C) can also be reached directly at [b](6) (b)(7)(C) if that's easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you could please just let me know afterward I'd be grateful).\n\nthanks very much,\n[b](6) (b)(7)(C)\n\nPage 13341\nDOJ-OGR-00023955",
