It's based in large part on the timeline you sent.\n\nIs there any reason why this information shouldn't be released to the public?\n\nOn July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.\n\nOn July 29th after daily interaction with Epstein, and according to established procedures, MCC-New York Psychology Services Department determined he no longer warranted placement on suicide watch.
