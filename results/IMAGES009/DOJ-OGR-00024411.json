The story will run over the weekend so I'd appreciate a response by COB today.\nThe thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide.\nHas any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein's death?\nHas there been a hiring surge since Epstein's suicide?\nAny changes in BOP policies following Epstein's suicide?\nIs it correct that Noel and Thomas were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of the suicide?\nWhat is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What's the average length of time a person stays in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it's available.)\nCan you share anything supervisors at MCC have told the rank and file in the wake of these charges?\nWhat's the message to overworked, disgruntled correctional officers?\nThank you,\n(b)(6) (b)(7)(C)\nManhattan Federal Court reporter\nNY DAILY NEWS\n917-589 (b)(6) (b)(7)(C)",
