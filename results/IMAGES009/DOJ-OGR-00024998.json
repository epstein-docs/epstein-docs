He elucidated concerns about his incarceration including not receiving his property yet in SHU, feeling cold in his cell, not receiving his Colace, not having enough water in attorney conference, and a desire to recreate in SHU.\" Inmate Epstein was also upset about wearing an orange jumpsuit and being treated like \"a bad guy\" when he did not do anything wrong in the prison. Custody and security concerns were addressed with inmate Epstein including why he has to wear his orange jumpsuit (due to his being housed in SHU). He requested that he be placed in a brown uniform during his legal visits. He was told his concerns would be addressed in the SHU meeting.\n\n[b(7)(A)]\n[b(7)(A)]\n\nHe did not sleep well last night.
