  "full_text": "Thomas acknowledged that neither he nor Noel conducted any rounds or counts in the SHU during their shift between approximately 12 a.m. and approximately 6:30 a.m. Thomas said the August 10, 2019 round sheets were signed, but the rounds were not conducted because he was tired that day. Thomas recalled \"dozing off from here and there\" during his shift, but he did not know if Noel slept. Thomas did not recall having a conversation with anyone concerning the discrepancy between the 12 a.m. SHU count slip, which listed 73 inmates, and the institutional count, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU. Thomas said he had filled out and signed the 3 a.m. SHU count slip, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU. Thomas did not know why the number of inmates was different on the 12 a.m. and 3 a.m. count slips and did not recall speaking with the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant about the 12 a.m. count. Thomas told the OIG that he knew he was falsely certifying the count slips when he signed them on August 10, 2019. B. Staff Rounds in the SHU 1.

He said that the Warden, Lieutenants, and other MCC New York staff members frequently told the SHU staff to conduct rounds and to keep an eye on Epstein. To reinforce this message, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge created a sign on orange paper that he hung on a computer in the SHU officer's area that said, \"MANADATORY [sic] ROUNDS MUST BE CONDUCTED EVERY 30 MINUTES ON EPSTEIN # 76318-054 AS PER GOD!!!!\" The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said the sign was hanging on the computer on August 9 and 10, 2019, and it was clearly visible to everyone who worked in the SHU. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant confirmed that written instructions to conduct rounds on Epstein were posted on the SHU computer. 40 This BOP form is officially entitled \"MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute Check Sheet.\"",
