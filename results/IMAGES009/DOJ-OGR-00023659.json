  "full_text": "The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement. They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC with the judge presiding over their case. Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. I won't rehash the statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's co-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice. At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and ended it. I expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion. Anyway, I wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; I verbally updated him, but he may need to forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me. Thanks, (b)(5) (b)(5) Staff Attorney CLC New York Metropolitan Correctional Center 150 Park Row New York, NY 10007 p: 646-836-(b)(6) f: 646-836-7665",
