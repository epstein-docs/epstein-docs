  "full_text": "Page 685\n\n3. Cellmate Assignments\nDocumentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the importance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes consultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision making of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members present when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not accurately reflect what occurred.\n\nInstitution Response:\nAs was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions were made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff meetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or Acting Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on housing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate presents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a sex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates. Moving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where housing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with psychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs. Please see the attached checklist.\n\n4. Documentation Accuracy\nProfessional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted in your response. However, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in documentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.\n\nAs noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be written within 24 hours of having the information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules. [b](7)(A)[/b]\n\n[b](7)(A)[/b] Preconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative explanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed.\n\nPlease develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for writing incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include an outline of the training and evidence of staff who attended the training.\n\nInstitution Response:\nAdditional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In addition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when it is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more appropriate. The additional information is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual Training. Annual Training began the week of January 6, 2020, and will continue through the week of March 8, 2020.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-00025109",
