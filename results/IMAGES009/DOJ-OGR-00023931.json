The first thing is that Inmate Epstein incorrectly wrote his reg. # on his request for the religious diet, so Sentry didn't recognize the number.

FSA [redacted] is aware of the inmate's dietary needs and has been providing the religious diet since last Friday I've been told.\n\nI also have another religious diet interview scheduled, which will require data entry.\n\nThanks again,\nChap\n\n>>> Charisma Edge 7/18/2019 1:57 PM >>>\nI spoke w Computer Svcs.
