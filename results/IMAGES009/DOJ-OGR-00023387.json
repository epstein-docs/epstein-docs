  "full_text": "buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on the floor in front of him. SHU staff immediately activate a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency and prompted MCC New York staff in the Control Center to call for 911 emergency services. SHU staff then rip the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which causes Epstein's buttocks to drop to the ground. SHU staff lay Epstein on the ground and immediately initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., BOP medical staff respond to the SHU, continue CPR, apply the automated external defibrillator, and move Epstein to MCC New York's Health Services Unit. Minutes after arriving in the Health Services Unit, an ambulance arrives and paramedics continue CPR, intubate Epstein, and administer medications and fluids. At approximately 7:10 a.m., the ambulance takes Epstein to New York Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital, where he is pronounced dead at 7:36 a.m. by the emergency room physician. MCC New York staff unsuccessfully attempts to recover video from the DVR 2 system of the SHU and the BOP begins repairing the DVR 2 system. The FBI seizes all hard drives contained in the DVR 2 system as evidence. August 11, 2019 The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, conducts an autopsy of Epstein. August 14-15, 2019 The FBI returns to MCC New York and seizes additional components of the DVR 2 system and the entire DVR 1 system. The FBI's Digital Forensics Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia, begins to conduct a forensic analysis of MCC New York's DVR systems and determines that there were catastrophic disk failures in the DVR 2 system disk array and no recordings were available on the DVR 2 system after July 29, 2019. August 16, 2019 The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, releases its findings publicly that the cause of Epstein's death was hanging and that the manner of death was suicide.",
