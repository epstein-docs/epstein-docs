When was Epstein taken off suicide watch?\n2. How long was he on suicide watch?\n3. What unit in the jail was he housed?\n4. Was he by himself?\n5. What's protocol for watching him at 6:30 in the morning? And in general during a 24 hour period?\n6. Is there an internal investigation? Are the guard(s) and/or supervisors placed on modified duty/or some sort of restricted duty while there is an ongoing investigation?\n7. Are there surveillance cameras? If so what do they show?\n8. What did he use to hang himself?\n\n(b)(6) (b)(7)(C)\nSenior Editor, writer\nThe Daily Beast\nM: 267-257 (b)(6)\nFacebook, Twitter, Instagram: @ (b)(6) (b)(7)(C)\n\nFrom: Lee Plourde (b)(6) @bop.gov>\nSent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 3:10:00 PM\nTo: (b)(6) (b)(7)(C) @thedailybeast.com>\nSubject: Re: Fwd: Jeffrey Epstein\n\nGood afternoon,\n\nI you may understand with the ongoing events please understand that time is very limited.
