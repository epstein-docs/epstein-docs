Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics.

Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment.\"\n\nThank you\n\nPsy.D.\nChief Psychologist\nU.S. Department of Justice/\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\n150 Park Row\nNew York, New York 10007\nOffice: (646) 836-\nFax: (646) 836-7712\nE-mail: @bop.gov\n\nPage 3108\nDOJ-OGR-00025396",
