Psychological Observation is a form of individual monitoring that is less restrictive than Suicide Watch. It is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general population or restrictive housing. It is often used to transition inmates off of Suicide Watch in order to monitor their transition and safety after an acute suicidal crisis. On July 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein underwent a formal, in-person suicide risk assessment with [b(6); (b)(7)(C)]. She determined that, while suicide watch was not warranted at that time, Mr. Epstein should remain on Psychological Observation status out of an abundance of caution.
