So far, no phone calls.\n\nAlso, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.\n\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(b)(6), (b)(7)(C)\n\nNOTICE: This message may contain information that is privileged or confidential.
