Additionally, if was concerned about suicide risk, P5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program, requires her to maintain direct, continuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When opened the e-mail the following Monday morning, Mr. Epstein was evaluated by at approximately 9:30 a.m. Mr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July 18, 2019. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's decision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this. Specifically PSY ALERT is used \"to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.\" Furthermore, P5324.07, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, \"When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.\" Both of these groups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional settings and experience stress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through the media). Mr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 31, 2019. It is unknown what time he departed or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice indicated Mr. Epstein had \"MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.\" The USMS requested R&D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August 1, 2019, at 8:46 a.m. sent an e-mail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been followed as outlined in P5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program.
