He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.\n\nDEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\n\nhe requested Protective Custody. His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because\n\nShirley Skipper-Scott\nAssociate Warden\nMCC New York\n150 Park Row\nNew York, New York 10007\nOffice: 646-836(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\n\nPage 477\nDOJ-OGR-00024761",
