He stated, \"I could be better,\" but acknowledged he is doing as well as can be expected given his circumstances. He reported he is going to court today for a status hearing. He stated he generally slept well last night and is readjusting to being placed back in SHU. He reported getting along well with his cell mate. He was informed of appropriate procedures for contacting Psychology staff while he is in SHU, if needed.\n\nCurrent Mental Status: Mr. EPSTEIN was alert and oriented. He was polite, calm, and cooperative in demeanor. He exhibited a neutral affect with appropriate range. Eye contact and hygiene were appropriate. He spoke with normal rate, tone, and volume. His thoughts were organized and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial, or irrelevant content. There was no evidence of perceptual disturbance, delusional ideation, or a formal thought disorder. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. He noted having normal sleeping and eating habits. Mr. EPSTEIN explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation, planning, and intent. He was future-oriented and expressed a commitment to life and safety, agreeing to contact staff immediately should he experience suicidal ideation or psychological distress. He also denied thoughts of harming others.\n\nIntervention(s)\nSupportive interventions and cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques were utilized. Mr. EPSTEIN was receptive to all interventions.\n\nProgress/Plan\nMr. EPSTEIN was educated about both routine and emergency procedures for contacting psychology. There appears to be no need for follow-up at this time and he expressed willingness to self refer to psychology staff if needed. He will continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews while he is housed in SHU. He was encouraged to reach out for PRN services should he experience any psychological distress.\n\nCompleted by [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] PsyD/DAPC on 07/31/2019 10:56\n\nGenerated 07/31/2019 10:56 by [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] PsyD/DAPC Bureau of Prisons - NYM\nPage 1 of 1",
