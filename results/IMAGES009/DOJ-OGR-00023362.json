  "full_text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nInvestigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York\n\nIntroduction and Background\nAccording to its website, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP)'s current mission statement is \"Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by preparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.\" However, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has repeatedly identified long-standing operational challenges that negatively affect the BOP's ability to operate its institutions safely and securely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide, functional security camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during this investigation and review into the custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP's most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of information from the BOP that on August 10, 2019, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, determined that Epstein had died by suicide.\n\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG's investigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein's death and determined there was no criminality pertaining to how Epstein had died.\n\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel's custody, care, and supervision of Epstein while detained at the facility from his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges on July 6, 2019, until his death on August 10.\n\nEpstein is Assigned to the SHU on July 7\nEpstein was assigned to a cell in the SHU on July 7 due to media coverage of his case and inmate awareness of his notoriety. SHU inmates are securely separated from general population inmates and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\n\nBOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all inmates at least twice an hour and that Lieutenants conduct at least one round in the SHU each shift. BOP policy also requires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour period. Among other things, inmate counts and rounds enable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they are secure in their cells and in good health. Further, to eliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU staff to search SHU common areas and at least five cells daily, and to search the entire SHU every week.\n\nOn July 18, the court refused to set bail for Epstein and ordered him detained pending trial on the criminal charges.\n\nIncident Involving Epstein on July 23\nWhile in MCC New York, Epstein was screened on numerous occasions by psychological staff, including a formal suicide assessment on July 9. In the evaluations he denied having thoughts or a history of attempted suicide. Psychological staff determined Epstein did not meet the criteria for a psychological diagnosis.\n\nOn July 23, at 1:27 a.m., correctional officers (CO) responded to Epstein's SHU cell where they found Epstein with an orange cloth around his neck. Epstein's cellmate told officers Epstein tried to hang himself. Medical staff examined Epstein, observed friction marks and superficial reddening around his neck and on his knee, and placed him on suicide watch. BOP policy requires that inmates identified as suicide risks be placed on suicide watch until no longer at imminent risk. The BOP uses a less restrictive monitoring form,\ni\nDOJ-OGR-00023362",
