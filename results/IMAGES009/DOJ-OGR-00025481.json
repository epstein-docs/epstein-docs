I can then run by (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) and my boss before I answer the reporter. Feel free to tell me if I've said more below from our conversation than may be appropriate to share with media.\nThanks,\n(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\nReporter: (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) - NY DAILY NEWS\nQuestions & Proposed Responses:\nHello, I'm working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) . I've spoken to an AFGE union official and (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) defense attorney. The story will run over the weekend so I'd appreciate a response by COB today.\nThe thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide.\n(1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein's death?\n(b)(5)\n(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein's suicide?\n(b)(5)\n(3) Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein's suicide?\n(b)(5)",
