  "full_text": "Page 760\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department returns from court routinely, and without a notice from the Judge or Marshal's Office, they will be screened by a member of the Psychology Department within 24 hours to assess if they are experiencing any significant distress regarding their court proceedings that may be exacerbating their mental health difficulties and/or risk factors.\nPer guidance from Central Office Psychology Division, the Psychology Department will conduct a training with R&D staff to help train them about PSY ALERT inmates and to recognize signs of psychological distress and suicidality. Suicide Prevention and PSY ALERT Trainings have recently been conducted by the Psychology Services Department with Lieutenants and during a recent Department Head Meeting. Further, an e-mail regarding PSY ALERT procedures was sent to all Lieutenants, Receiving and Discharge (R&D), Psychology and Health Services staff.\n8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy: According to a SENTRY quarters roster generated on August 10, 2019, at 12:51 a.m., there were three inmates assigned to Mr. Epstein's SHU cell, Z04-206LAD, including him, at the time of his death. However, his SHU cell was only a double occupancy cell. Inmate [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] inmate [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] and Mr. Epstein were all assigned to the same cell. On August 13, 2019, at 12:06 p.m. and 12:08 p.m., a quarters history roster was generated for inmate [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] and inmate [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] respectively. Inmate [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] cell assignment was Z04-206LAD from August 5, 2019, until August 11, 2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-212UAD. Inmate [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] cell assignment was Z04-206UAD from August 1, 2019, until August 11, 2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-207LAD. A quarters history roster was generated for Mr. Epstein on August 13, 2019, at 9:07 a.m. His cell assignment was Z04-206LAD from July 29, 2019, until August 10, 2019.\nOn Monday, August 12, 2019, photographs of nametags on SHU cell doors and SHU locator forms were sent to the Correctional Service Department in the Northeast Region. The SHU locator form is dated August 9, 2019. It shows inmate [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] in cell 207L (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] in cell 212U (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate Epstein in cell 220L (SENTRY never shows him in this cell) along with inmate Reyes (#85993-054). The locator shows inmate [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] and inmate [b(6); (b)(7)(C)] in cell 206. The photo sheets show the cell being 220 with inmates Epstein and Reyes' identification cards on the door. Inmate Reyes, Efrain, Reg. No. 85993-054 was in cell Z06-220U from August 5, 2019 to August 9, 2019.\nMCC New York has four suicide watch cells and each is for single occupancy use. The suicide watch cells are located in Health Services. Each cell is abbreviated with the unit code H01 in SENTRY followed by the four-digit cell number. The doors are identified by a painted number from one to four. Two reviews were conducted. The first revealed Mr. Epstein was in H01-001L according to SENTRY but the Suicide Watch Log Books indicate he was in cell 4. A second review was conducted on August 13, 2019, while there were four inmates on in these cells. SENTRY showed two inmates assigned to H01-001L, one assigned to H01-002L, and the fourth inmate assigned to a general population housing unit. Through physical observation of the dedicated suicide watch cells there were four H01 cells, however a review of the BOPWARE Inmate Housing Format, only shows three cells.\nInmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required by P5500.14, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.\nInstitution Response: 8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy:\nWith regard to the accuracy and accountability of inmates placed on suicide watch status in the hospital area, Psychology Services now runs a daily SENTRY roster of all the inmates on suicide watch in that area. The roster is examined to ensure that the inmates placed on suicide watch in a suicide watch cell are keyed into SENTRY with 9",
