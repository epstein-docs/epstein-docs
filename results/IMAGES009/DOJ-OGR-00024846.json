(b)(6); (b)(7)(C) left his phone number as 646-836(b)(6); (b)(7)(C).\n\nCan you please confirm whether that individual is in fact with BOP and/or MCC? Defense counsel is understandably concerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get hoax or otherwise inaccurate information through phone calls and emails. And we would again respectfully but urgently request that if there is information like this that needs to go to representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his counsel with confidence that it is true and accurate.\n\n(Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein's body, his defense counsel is extremely concerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any other investigative steps, and we would want to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has also been informed—but that's only if this is not a hoax, obviously.)\n\nPlease advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps to retrieve the body.\n\nthank you,\n(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\n\nFrom: (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) (USANYS) [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)@usa.doj.gov]\nSent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 15:56\nTo: (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) @bop.gov (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) (USANYS)\n(b)(6); (b)(7)(C) @usa.doj.gov (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\nCc: (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) USANYS (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) @usms.doj.gov (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) (USMS)\nSubject: RE: Epstein update\n\nHi (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\n\nI'm checking in to see if you're able to provide us with additional information.
