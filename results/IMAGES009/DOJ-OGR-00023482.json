LAKE\nASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL\nINVESTIGATIONS DIVISION\nFROM:\nColette S. Peters, Director\nSUBJECT:\nResponse to the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) Draft Report: Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York\nThe Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to formally respond to the Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) above-referenced draft report. BOP values OIG's careful review of the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the recommendations resulting from this engagement. The lessons learned during the course of this engagement will be applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape.\nThe facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this report reflect a failure to follow BOP's longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While this misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very small percentage of the approximately 35,000 employees across more than 120 institutions who continue to strive for correctional excellence every day.\nIn the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve accountability. In response to this and previous OIG and Government Accountability Office (GAO) engagements, BOP has already begun to evaluate nationwide trends and strengthen employee accountability.",
