I received your voicemails regarding the status of Mr. Epstein's personal effects. Presently, while the external investigation continues, any personal property attributable to Mr. Epstein is being held as evidence. Once the outside investigators release the property, we hope to be able to return it to his family as expeditiously as possible.\nIf you have any further questions, please email me and we can try to arrange a mutually convenient time to chat further.\nThank you,\n(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\nPage 2668\nDOJ-OGR-00025305",
