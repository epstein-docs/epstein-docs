To summarize, they are requesting:\n1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits;\n2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and\n3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.\nPlease review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.\n(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\nSupervisory Staff Attorney\nCLC New York\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\n150 Park Row\nNew York, New York 10007\np: (646)836-(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\nf: (646)836-7665\n>> (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)@gmail.com> 7/22/2019 12:34 PM >>>\nGood morning (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\nI tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) Lieutenant (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) where (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Lieutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Lieutenant (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) or anyone else make this memo available?\nOur client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.\nAlso, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.\nThank you in advance for your help.\nPage 1138",
