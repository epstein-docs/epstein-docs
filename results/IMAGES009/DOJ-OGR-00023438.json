  "full_text": "Figure 5.3\nPhotograph of a Piece of Orange Cloth Hanging from the Bunkbed in Epstein's Cell Following His Death\n\nThomas explained that when he first entered Epstein's cell, Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a sheet or a shirt, around his neck. The end of the string was tied to the top portion of the bunkbed. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position, with his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 and a half inches off the floor and his legs extended out straight on the floor. Thomas said Epstein did not look discolored or very different from when he last saw Epstein alive. Thomas said he immediately ripped the orange sheet or shirt away from the bunkbed, and Epstein's buttocks dropped approximately 1 inch to 1 and a half to the ground. Thomas then lowered Epstein's entire body to the floor and, because he did not believe Epstein was breathing, Thomas immediately began providing chest compressions until responding MCC New York staff members arrived approximately 1 minute later. Thomas said he did not provide rescue breaths and was unaware if Epstein was dead or alive because he never checked for a pulse before initiating chest compressions. Thomas said medical personnel took over the emergency response, including chest compressions and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), when they arrived. Thomas said he assisted with bringing Epstein down to the Health Services Unit on the second floor, and that he left MCC New York at approximately 8 a.m. Thomas said he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training during MCC New York annual refresher training and had responded to medical emergencies in the past, but this was the first time he was the first responder.\n\nSource: Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York\n\nThomas said he was present in the SHU for his entire shift on August 10, 2019, from 12 a.m. until the time he attempted to deliver breakfast to Epstein at approximately 6:30 a.m. and did not see anyone go inside Epstein's cell during his shift. Thomas said that he would have known if someone went in or out of Epstein's cell and said no one did. Thomas told the OIG that he could see Epstein's cell door from the SHU Officers' Station, but he could not see inside the cell from that vantage point. Thomas said that it was not possible for anyone to have entered the SHU without his knowledge because he or Noel would have had to open the SHU door for anyone to gain entry. The only other key to the SHU was located elsewhere in the institution; no other MCC New York staff members had the keys required to gain access to the SHU. Moreover, Thomas said that anyone attempting to access the L Tier where Epstein was located would have had to walk directly in front of the SHU Officers' Station where Thomas was seated, and no one did. Thomas denied that he or Noel had any role in Epstein's death.\n\nNoel told the OIG that on the morning on August 10, when it was time to deliver food to the inmates, she unlocked the door to the L Tier and stood by it while Thomas took the food to the inmates. Noel said that when Thomas knocked on Epstein's door, there was no response. Noel said Epstein's cell door was locked, so Thomas used a key to open it and went inside. Noel heard Thomas call out for her to retrieve the cutter\n71\nDOJ-OGR-00023438",
