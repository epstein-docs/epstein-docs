Warden Petrucci sends his regrets for not being able to make it, but he would still appreciate meeting the Judge. Please let me know if Judge Berman would be amenable and has any open time in his schedule.\nThank you,\n(b)(6), (b)(7)(C)\nStaff Attorney\nCLC New York\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\n150 Park Row\nNew York, NY 10007\np: 646-836-(b)(6)\nf: 646-836-7665\n(b)(6), (b)(7)(C) 8/23/2019 10:41 AM >>>\nGood morning Christine,\nI apologize, but Warden Petrucci told me he won't be able to make it on Tuesday. As you likely know, we've had quite a few visitors here at MCC recently. The Warden just learned about a meeting on Tuesday morning, and he needs to be in attendance. That said, he would welcome the opportunity to meet Judge Berman another time. Perhaps the Warden and I could go over to the courthouse sometime next week at a time convenient for the Judge? Please let me know if that sounds feasible.\nThank you for your help, and I look forward to seeing you on Monday (re: (b)(6), (b)(7)(C)) and Tuesday.\nBest,\n(b)(6), (b)(7)(C)\nStaff Attorney\nCLC New York\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\n150 Park Row\nNew York, NY 10007\np: 646-836-(b)(6)\nPage 4797\nDOJ-OGR-00024222",
