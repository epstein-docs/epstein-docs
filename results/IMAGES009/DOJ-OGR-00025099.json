  "full_text": "MCC NEW YORK UPDATES\n\nCurrent Assessment:\n\nSome of the issues identified are due to seriously reduced staffing levels, improper or lack of training, and follow up and oversight. Since January 1, 2019, MCC New York has hired 18 staff and lost 33 staff to retirement, and transfers within the BOP and other agencies.\n\nTo date approximately approximately 148 staff from multiple regions assisted NYM which we are very grateful for their assistance. All subject matter TDY staff are required to provide a report to the Warden prior to their departure. This report is similar to a Program Review report and includes areas of concern, tasks done well and recommendations. These reports will be shared with the Associate Wardens and Department Heads for guidance.\n\nFurther, to ensure the training and efforts that will occur is sustainable, there will need to be continuous oversight by leadership. Therefore, several positions will need to be added to the staff compliment, such as an Associate Warden over Correctional Services, a Deputy Captain, and an Assistant Case Management Coordinator, Assistant Food Services Administrator, to name a few.",
