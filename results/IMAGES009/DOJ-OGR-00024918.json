Monroe St. Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001 Dear Governor DeSantis, \"For 48 years, I've dedicated my life to enforcing and upholding the law; as a patrol officer, detective, chief of police and, since 2004, as the Sheriff of Palm Beach County. My job now, as it has always been, is to not only maintain public safety but also the public's trust. Given the recent questions that have been raised around the Jeffrey Epstein case, I am formally requesting that FDLE assume the existing criminal investigation and I pledge the cooperation and participation of my agency. I believe the public interest would be best served by an FDLE-led investigation examining every aspect of the Epstein case, from court sentencing to incarceration. My agency will continue with the on-going internal affairs investigation. As you know, Governor, I'm proud of this Department, and the men and women who devote their lives every day to protecting others. Be rest assured as with any issue or concern that has crossed my desk over the past 15 years I will strive for the truth, wherever that leads, to ensure justice is served and the public trust in our law enforcement agency is maintained.\" Sincerely, Ric Bradshaw, Sheriff 3228 Gun Club Road * West Palm Beach, Florida 33406-3001 * (561) 688-3021 * Email: BradshawR@pbso.org DOJ-OGR-00024918",
