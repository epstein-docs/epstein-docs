My mobile Samsung is not always receiving emails and leaving work now, so my personal cell by calling the number above is best if you get this. Thanks so much, [b(6); (b)(7)(C) [b(6); (b)(7)(C) Public Information Office Federal Bureau of Prisons (202) 353- [b(6); (b)(7)(C) >> [b(6); (b)(7)(C) 7/23/2019 5:57 PM >>> [b(6); (b)(7)(C) While I will probably reply to this reporter with something like my draft below which doesn't reveal much if anything, nonetheless we want to be sure we understand from you or the institution what if anything may have happened with inmate Epstein. Could you see if the institution can look into this and provide us with what they may know for our internal purposes (not for release to media)? We will reply to media inquiries about Epstein (not the institution) since stories about him are national news (unless we finalize an answer that we could give to the institution to use as well if media ask about this tomorrow).
