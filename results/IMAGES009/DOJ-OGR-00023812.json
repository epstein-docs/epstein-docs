You can donate to my university, the historically black college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world you are not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can be for \"The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics,\" which will show the world your support for women.\n\nAlternatively, (b)(6) (b)(7)(C) gave $3 million \"Breakthrough Awards\" to two math professors. You can give me a similar award. (b)(6) (b)(7)(C) of Oxford, former President of the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, \"I thought your analysis of the bee epidemic was nice, and could well be useful.\" In 2018, I solved a problem of Pólya Prize-winner (b)(6) (b)(7)(C) which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a \"challenging question\" in 1976) about matchings in infinite geometric lattices.\n\nI am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now.\n\nIf you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for a lectureship in Pure Mathematics.

The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and you'd have an advocate at one of the world's most prestigious universities publically defending you.
