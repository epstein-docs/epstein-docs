  "full_text": "Page 757\nThe Psychology Department has eliminated Psychology Observation at MCC-NY. Both Staff and the Lieutenants received additional training on when they are required to complete rounds and sign Suicide Watch log books. With regard to suicide watch log books signatures, correctional staff are required to perform routine rounds every hour. The 2 Sally Officer on Monday- Friday during Day Watch is required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates as prescribed by the Captain. After-hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals, collecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal 1 or Internal 2 assisting with duties as assigned by the Captain. Additionally, Psychology staff check the suicide watch logs daily when they interview the inmates on suicide watch. If it is noted hourly rounds are not being conducted by the Unit Officer and/or the Lieutenants are not rounding and signing the books each shift, the Associate Warden over Programs and the Captain are notified immediately and enforce accountability.\n5. Telephone Calls: In a PDS-BEMR note written by [redacted] on July 16, 2019, she was informed by an unnamed staff member that a lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls for Mr. Epstein. It is unknown when and to whom these calls were placed and no evidence that they took place on a monitored telephone.\nAccording to a memorandum from Unit Manager [redacted] on August 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein terminated his legal visit early on August 9, 2019, in order to place a telephone call to his family. Mr. [redacted] (who was the Institutional Duty Officer that week) escorted Mr. Epstein to SHU around 7:00 p.m. that evening and he was placed in the shower area on G tier. While there, he was provided the telephone to make a call.\nSince Mr. Epstein reportedly did not have his PAC or PIN number, which is required to use the inmate telephone system, the Unit Manager placed the call, dialing a number that reportedly began with area code 347. Mr. Epstein told Mr. [redacted] he was calling his mother who, according to public records, has been deceased since 2004.\nInstitution Response: 5. Telephone calls:\nThere is no documentation to substantiate that a Lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls to Mr. Epstein. However, there is documented evidence that Unit Manager [redacted] provided a call to Mr. Epstein on July 30, 2019, at 5:15 p.m., to a [redacted] friend, on a monitored telephone/speaker phone. The call was documented in a log that is maintained in the Correctional Systems Department. Mr. Epstein was provided a call because he had not been able to conduct voice recording on the inmate telephone. This is standard procedure by the Unit Team at MCC New York, to occasionally provide a call to new arrivals, when necessary.\n6. Direct Observation: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2019, until July 24, 2019. While on suicide watch on July 23, 2019, Mr. Epstein attended an Attorney visit from approximately 12:40 p.m. until 7:15 p.m. During this time, he was without \"direct, continuous observation\" by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by P5324.08. While on Psychological Observation, he attended attorney visits on July 24, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 25, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 26, 2019, for 9.25 hours; on July 27, 2019, for 11.33 hours; on July 28, 2019, for 10.5 hours; and on July 29, 2019, for 8 hours. On July 30, 2019, Psychology Observation was terminated. During these visits, continuous observation by a dedicated BOP staff member was not maintained as required by MCC New York's Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation.\nInstitution Response: 6. Direct Observation:\nThe Psychology Department has eliminated Psychology Observation at MCC-NY. Inmates on Suicide Watch are only provided legal visits under special circumstances as deemed by the Court.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-00025119",
