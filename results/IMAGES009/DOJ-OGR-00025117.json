An Intake Screening should have been conducted within 24 hours of his entry into Bureau custody which was on July 6, 2019, according to P6031.04, Patient Care.\n\nOfficer [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b] was responsible for observing Mr. Epstein and documenting his behavior while on suicide watch on July 23, 2019. Officer [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b] mistakenly used a Suicide Watch Log Book intended for inmate companion documentation between 1:40 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on July 23, 2019, when he should have been using the Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. Ms. [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b], Drug Treatment Specialist, reportedly noticed this error and subsequently hand copied all of Officer [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b] entries from 1:40 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. into a Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. She then initialed these entries, and this makes it appear as if she was the one conducting the watch. This information was discovered and conveyed to [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b] with a carbon copy to Warden N'Diaye on August 12, 2019. Of note, Ms. [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b] did not make an entry explaining why she was making the log book changes. Additionally, Ms. [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b] then wrote entries for 6:15, 6:30, 6:45 and 7:00 a.m. in the Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. These were not a part of the original entries made by Officer [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b] nor was Ms. [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b] assigned to work the Suicide Watch post. Due to the inability to interview staff at this time, it is unknown why Ms. [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b] attempted to correct Officer [b](6); (b)(7)(C)[/b] error, or made any of the subsequent log entries. It is recommended that if a staff member makes an entry error (e.g., writes in the incorrect suicide watch log book), the staff member should describe the error in the correct log book, to include indicating when they became aware of the error. The staff member should then notify the Chief Psychologist.\n\nA review of Special Housing Unit Records (BP-A0292) revealed a number of incomplete entries. This document is used to monitor provision and receipt of basic services such as recreation, medical rounds, showers, meal consumption, etc. The Officer in Charge signature is missing in 10 occasions and a medical provider's signature is missing in seven instances. There are six instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein ate his meal. There are nine instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein took a shower. There are ten instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein was offered recreation. P5500.15, Correctional Services Manual requires accurate and complete information on the BP-A0292.\n\nA review of Psychology Observation Log Books revealed significant discrepancies from the approved Psychological Observation Procedural Memorandum, dated April 15, 2019. A Correctional Officer is required to complete hourly rounds and sign the log book.\n\n179 out of 183 round signatures were missing. The lieutenant is required to sign the log book one time per shift and signatures were missing in 10 of 23 instances.
