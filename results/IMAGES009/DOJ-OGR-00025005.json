Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for suicidality at this time including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had a court proceeding yesterday which could have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, this writer instructed R&D staff, as well as the Lieutenant's Office, to immediately notify the psychology department when he returned from court.
