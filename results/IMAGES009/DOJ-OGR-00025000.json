Today, he presented this writer with numerous concerns and requests. He stated he does not want to be housed in the SHU because he is not comfortable there; he wants to be single-celled if he goes to the SHU; he wants Colace, not the Ducolax he received from medical yesterday; he wants to be able to walk around and go to recreation; he does not want to wear an orange uniform to his legal visits because he is treated \"like a punished inmate\"; he wants a phone call before he leaves the psychological observation area; he wants a shower and towel; he would like to be housed in the cadre (5S) unit; and would like his property, paper, and a pen.\n\nInmate Epstein's concerns were addressed by this writer and it was explained to him he will not be single-celled or placed in a housing unit for safety and security concerns. His medical concerns (constipation) were discussed with health services as well as his desire to be placed on Colace. Inmate Epstein was provided a shower this morning.\n\nIntervention(s)\nInmate Epstein was provided with supportive intervention and coping skills strategies today. He was receptive to interventions and was able to elucidate his various needs. He did not present with any acute psychopathology and continues to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. He is looking forward to his bail hearing on Monday but stated he is aware that even if he gets bail, it will take at least two weeks to sort things out so he can leave the jail.\n\nProgress/Plan\nInmate Epstein is not in any psychological distress, does not present with any mental health symptoms or complaints, and is denying any suicidality. He appears psychologically stable at this time and can be released from the psychological observation area. Inmate Epstein will be housed in the 9S area with a cellmate. He will be seen again tomorrow by psychology to evaluate his mental status and psychological stability.\n\nCompleted by (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) PhD/Chief Psychologist on 07/10/2019 09:09\n\nGenerated 07/10/2019 09:09 by (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) PhD/Chief Bureau of Prisons - NYM\nPage 1 of 1\nDOJ-OGR-00025000",
