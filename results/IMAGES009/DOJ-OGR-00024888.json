He was very cooperative and agreed to send us Epstein's PSR and/or any documents that have PSR-like information. He said a lot of the Epstein files were destroyed per their RIDS before Epstein was even arrested here, but he is going to do through whatever documents they have for me. (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) said it would take about a week for him to pull the relevant documents. Once he gathered the documents, he said he would send them to me rather than email them. Apparently Florida has a very open FOIA law and all of his emails are subject to public disclosure (which sounds like a nightmare!). He said he would burn the documents onto a CD and FedEx it to me (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) . I'll be out of the office next week, but he has (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) number. (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) said he would call (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) and give him a heads-up that the mail was forthcoming.\nFeel free to give me a ring if you want to discuss further.\nThank you!\n(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\nStaff Attorney\nCLC New York\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\n150 Park Row\nNew York, NY 10007\np: 646-836-(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)\nf: 646-836-7665",
