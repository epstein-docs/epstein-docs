I'll let the Court know about your facility placing the call to chambers. The number for the Judge is (914) 390-[redacted]. If that changes, I'll let you know.\nThanks for again your assistance with this.\n[redacted]\n\nFrom: [redacted] @bop.gov\nSent: Tuesday, July 23, 2019 3:12 PM\nTo: [redacted]\nCc: [redacted]\nSubject: Re: Inmate [redacted] - Phone Conference with Court and counsel [IWOV-Active.FID2445012]\n\nHi [redacted],\nIt is easier for us to initiate the call here at MCC. [redacted] will be on a phone that does not allow incoming calls, so we prefer to call the court (or you) at the designated time and transfer the call down to him. Please let us know if that is an issue. Assuming there's no problem with that, please let us know the appropriate number to call at 11:00 AM on August 9.\n\nAlso, so you're aware, we make every effort to facilitate telephonic court appearances, but there may be emergency circumstances that interfere. If we learn that we will not be able to facilitate the call for some reason, we will let you know as soon as possible.\n\nIf you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our office.\n\nThank you,\n[redacted]\n[redacted]\nPage 15493\nDOJ-OGR-00024007",
