I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream media.\nWe were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you have any statement on the situation?\nThank you,\n[redacted]\n--\n[redacted] Reporter | BuzzFeed News\nPGP | Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, Cell: +1 (613) 276-[redacted]\nSend anonymous tip: contact.buzzfeed.com\nPage 3832\nDOJ-OGR-00023867",
