PETRUCCI, WARDEN\nMCC NEW YORK\nFROM: J. Ray Ormond, Regional Director\nNortheast Region\nSUBJECT: After Action Review Team\nOn August 14, 2019, a team of staff will arrive at MCC New York to perform an After Action Review on the apparent suicide of Inmate Jeffrey Epstein Reg. No. 76318-054. The duration of this visit will be fluid and conclude once the assessments are complete. During this visit, the teams will work largely independently, but may require your staff to perform specialized tasks or be available for interviews, etc. Please ensure your staff are responsive to the team's requests.\nUpon arrival, the team will begin their assessments without delay. J. A. Keller, Regional Director, Southeast Region, and the team will meet with you to discuss the plan for the week. I am requesting you have a staff member from Computer Services available to assist with any network needs that may arise. If feasible, any videos or electronic records must be available for the team to review independently. It may be necessary to utilize external hard drives or allow team members temporary access to a local drive. Several team members will have government issued laptops for use during this review.\nAs mentioned, ensure your staff are available and responsive. Also, advise your local union of this visit. Union representation should be quickly accessible should the need arise.\nDOJ-OGR-00025127",
