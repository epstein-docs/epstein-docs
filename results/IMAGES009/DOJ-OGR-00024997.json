The officer in attorney conference notified this writer that he was asking to be seen.\n\nSubjective/Objective Presentation\nInmate Epstein reported he has not received a spoon or soap in SHU, nor did he receive the phone calls that were \"promised to him.\" He told this writer we need to have mutual trust that his needs are met in the prison. This writer told inmate Epstein that she would address his concerns. On the way out, a staff member told this writer she witnessed inmate Epstein receive two phone calls from the Lt. Nonetheless, this writer informed the SHU lieutenant of his concerns and he said he would ensure that he had soap, a spoon, and his initial SHU phone call. Inmate Epstein did not have any psychological concerns today. He denied any mental health symptoms or suicidality. He has been eating as best as he can and has requested a Kosher diet.\n\nIntervention(s)\nInmate EPSTEIN was provided with brief supportive and psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. Inmate EPSTEIN was receptive to these interventions. He continued with his legal visit.\n\nProgress/Plan\nInmate EPSTEIN was educated about both routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology staff. He was reminded of the self-help books and audiotapes available through the Psychology department. There appears to be no need for follow up at this time.
