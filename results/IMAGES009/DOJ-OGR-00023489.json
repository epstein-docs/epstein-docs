  "full_text": "DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL June 27, 2023 DOJ OIG Releases Report on the BOP's Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz announced today the release of a report of investigation regarding the Federal Bureau of Prison's (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein while detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New York). Epstein died by suicide on August 10, 2019 while in BOP custody. The focus of DOJ Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) investigation was the conduct of BOP personnel. The DOJ OIG investigation and review identified: Numerous and Serious Failures by MCC New York Staff. The DOJ OIG found numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff constituting misconduct and dereliction of their duties. Among other things, these failures resulted in Epstein being unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in his locked cell on August 10 at approximately 6:30 a.m. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Was Assigned a Cellmate. Following a July 23, 2019, incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York Psychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate. On August 9, Epstein's cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York staff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was assigned a new cellmate. MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein and Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit (SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells, and ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein's death failed to carry out these responsibilities. Specifically, only one SHU cell search was documented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein's cell. BOP records did not indicate when Epstein's cell was last searched. Had Epstein's cell been searched as required, the search would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell. The OIG also found that SHU staff did not conduct any 30-minute rounds after about 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted after 4:00 p.m. on August 9. MCC New York staff falsified count slips and round sheets to show that they had been performed when they were not, leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his death. Following a DOJ OIG investigation, two MCC New York employees were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records. The charges were dismissed upon compliance by the employees with the terms of deferred prosecution agreements they entered into with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. That office declined prosecution for DOJ-OGR-00023489",
