  "full_text": "Good morning Christine,\n\nI apologize, but Warden Petrucci told me he won't be able to make it on Tuesday. As you likely know, we've had quite a few visitors here at MCC recently. The Warden just learned about a meeting on Tuesday morning, and he needs to be in attendance. That said, he would welcome the opportunity to meet Judge Berman another time. Perhaps the Warden and I could go over to the courthouse sometime next week at a time convenient for the Judge? Please let me know if that sounds feasible.\n\nThank you for your help, and I look forward to seeing you on Monday (redacted) and Tuesday.\n\nBest,\n(redacted)\nStaff Attorney\nCLC New York\nMetropolitan Correctional Center\n150 Park Row\nNew York, NY 10007\np: 646-836-(redacted)\nf: 646-836-7665\n\n>>> (redacted) 8/21/2019 11:06 AM >>>\nGood morning Christine,\n\nPlease thank Judge Berman for the invitation!
