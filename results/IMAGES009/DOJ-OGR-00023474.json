During their interviews with the OIG, the Northeast Regional Director, the Warden, Associate Warden 1, and the Captain clarified that they expected a Lieutenant conducting a round in the SHU to check in with the officers, walk down each of the tiers in the SHU, speak with inmates, and address inmate concerns. They explained that the Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk down each of the tiers to check on the inmates in the SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population, SHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP Lieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant attended in 2011, taught that Operations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that \"[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.\" Instead, Operations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs and reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.\n\nThe OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant to adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to conduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure.\n\nC.

In such circumstances, the telephone \"must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and \"must be set to record telephone calls.\" Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the BOP's Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate's name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call.
