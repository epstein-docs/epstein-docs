Changes in Risk Factors Assessed Upon a review of the log book, it was indicated Mr. EPSTEIN has been speaking to the inmate companions about having previously taught mathematics and physics. He has been observed pacing the cell as well as sleeping, eating, and drinking within normal limits. Upon interview today, Mr. EPSTEIN requested he be provided a toothbrush as well as a shower. His requests were made known to the lieutenants and he was provided a shower prior to attending his legal visit. This writer also provided him a toothbrush, toothpaste, and hygiene products. (b)(7)(A) (b)(7)(A) Reason for Removal from Watch Mr. EPSTEIN stated, \"I have no interest in killing myself.\" He explained although his situation is \"not perfect\" due to his being incarcerated, he noted he has \"lots to do for [his] legal case.\" He described having a \"wonderful life,\" to include interactions with \"interesting people and projects.\" He said \"it would be crazy\" to take his life. He furthered, \"I would not do that to myself.\" Mr. EPSTEIN did express a feeling of safety being housed on Psychological Observation rather than in the SHU. He asked if he could remain on this status for a couple of days, he was advised his housing situation will be re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. He expressed a desire to be housed in general population rather than in the SHU and asked if there were a \"safer\" unit for him to be housed in comparison to the one where he was initially placed. Mr. EPSTEIN claimed there were many MS-13 gang members on the initial unit. He was advised he will be maintained on Psychological Observation in the near future, but his long-term housing situation will be revisited, as it is not ideal for one to remain in isolation on Psychological Observation for extended periods of time. Mr. EPSTEIN acknowledged this information and thanked this writer for her explanation and time.
