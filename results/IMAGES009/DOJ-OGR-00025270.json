He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.\nSent from my iPhone\nPage 2501\nDOJ-OGR-00025270",
