Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide.\n\n(1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein's death?\n(b)(5)\n\n(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein's suicide?\n(b)(5)\n\n(3) Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein's suicide?\n(b)(5)\n\n(4) Is it correct that (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of the suicide?\n(b)(5)\n\n(5) What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers?
