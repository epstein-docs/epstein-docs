Defense counsel is understandably concerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get hoax or otherwise inaccurate information through phone calls and emails. And we would again respectfully but urgently request that if there is information like this that needs to go to representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his counsel with confidence that it is true and accurate. (Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein's body, his defense counsel is extremely concerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any other investigative steps, and we would want to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has also been informed—but that's only if this is not a hoax, obviously.) Please advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps to retrieve the body. thank you, [redacted] From: [redacted] Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 15:56 To: [redacted] Cc: [redacted] Subject: RE: Epstein update Hi [redacted] I'm checking in to see if you're able to provide us with additional information. I'm 646-618-[redacted] when you have a moment. Thanks, [redacted] From: [redacted] @bop.gov Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 11:42 AM To: [redacted] Cc: [redacted] Subject: Re: Epstein update Hi [redacted] MCC Administrators have been in touch with [redacted] at the USMS since early this morning. I too have been in touch with [redacted] since a little after 9 am, at which time I shared the limited information I had. The press release is the sum total of the information we have at this time pending the investigation. I am going into the secure perimeter to see if there is more information to share, but please be advised that some of what I get may be shared with your office but not further since it is an open investigation.",
