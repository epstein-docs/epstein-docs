I too have been in touch with (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) since a little after 9 am, at which time I shared the limited information I had. The press release is the sum total of the information we have at this time pending the investigation. I am going into the secure perimeter to see if there is more information to share, but please be advised that some of what I get may be shared with your office but not further since it is an open investigation.

When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone? I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise. Thank you.
