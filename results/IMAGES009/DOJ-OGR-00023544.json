We are in the process of working on a story about the cameras outside Jeffrey Epstein's cell on the morning of his death. The story will assert that the data in those cameras was found to be corrupted/unreadable, though it is being sent to Quantico for further analysis.\n\nCan the BOP comment on that assertion? Is the functionality of cameras a larger issue at BOP or MCC? Are you able to say what other cameras might have captured that night to support the assertion that Mr. Epstein killed himself?\n\nThank you,\n\n(b)(6), (b)(7)(C) | The Washington Post\n(202) 629-(b)(6) (cell)\n\nDOJ-OGR-00023544",
