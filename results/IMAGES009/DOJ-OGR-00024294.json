I will monitor this closely and I have already put out an email to all staff on the media and who are the only approved staff that are allowed to speak to them. In addition the Warden held a recall today expressing the concerns if staff are sharing information and how it is prohibited. Please let me know your thoughts.\n\nNew York Times must be getting staff email addresses through social media outlets.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: [redacted] @nytimes.com>\nDate: Aug 12, 2019 12:29 PM\nSubject: Question from NYTimes...\nTo: [redacted]\nCc:\n\nHi [redacted],\n\nI hope this finds you well. My name is [redacted] and I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm sorry to reach out out of the blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. We're trying to learn a little more about the prison and how it works internally (I hear there have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and I was wondering if you might be free for a quick chat on background (meaning that I will not use your name in any article, or anything that could identify you). I'd just like to learn a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying around, as you know, and we'd like to be able to speak in concrete terms about the prison from people who know it best. Please let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 212-556-[redacted].\n\nThanks,\n[redacted]\n\n--\n[redacted]\nThe New York Times\nOffice: 212-556-[redacted]\nCell/Signal: +1 240-423-[redacted]\n\nPage 7687\nDOJ-OGR-00024294",
