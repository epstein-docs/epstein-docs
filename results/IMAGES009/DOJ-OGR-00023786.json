You can donate to my university, the historically black college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world you are not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can be for \"The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics,\" which will show the world your support for women.

If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for a lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They've raised less than £10,000! https://www.givecampus.com/schools/LincolnCollege/mathematics-fellowship I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting money from you would be \"a tough one for a UK institution,\" but if you funded me as an individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might be open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and you'd have an advocate at one of the world's most prestigious universities publically defending you.
