  "full_text": "requested to provide information.6 The BOP employees and contractors we interviewed included employees involved in various aspects of the emergency response, who worked at MCC New York in the days leading up to the response and following the response, as well as other individuals with information pertinent to our investigation. Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of 15 inmates who had been housed at MCC New York during time periods relevant to our investigation, including three who were housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the day Epstein died.7 Those three L-Tier inmates were housed in cells opposite Epstein's cell and therefore had a direct line of sight to Epstein's cell on the night of August 9-10. The OIG also reached out to one of Epstein's attorneys to discuss the possibility of providing information, but ultimately the attorney declined to be interviewed, citing attorney-client privilege (the attorney-client privilege survives a client's death) and issues related to ongoing litigation involving Epstein's estate.\n\nThe OIG also collected over 127,000 documents, as well as MCC New York video and photographs. Among these were BOP documents, including staff rosters; daily logs and reports; investigative and incident reports; documentation regarding inmate counts and 30-minute rounds; inmate housing assignment documentation; inmate transfer documents; Psychology Department reports and medical records relating to Epstein; Epstein's institutional phone call records; MCC New York records of Epstein's visits with his attorneys; electronic communications, including text messages and emails of BOP employees and contractors; MCC New York security camera surveillance video; records from contractors regarding the MCC New York security camera system; service records for MCC New York's security camera system; MCC New York photographs, including photographs taken of efforts to revive Epstein on the morning of August 10, 2019; BOP policies and program statements; MCC New York Post Orders; and financial records. The OIG also conducted forensic analysis of the computers located in the SHU and BOP cellular telephones. In addition, the OIG reviewed FBI investigative records, including interview reports (FD-302), notes from witness interviews and other meetings, and electronic communications.
