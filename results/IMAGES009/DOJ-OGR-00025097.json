  "full_text": "MCC NEW YORK UPDATES\nPsychology has been providing feedback at Executive Staff Meetings regarding inmates at-risk for suicidality and discussing cellmate placement (both GP and SHU) for inmates with significant mental health issues and suicide risk factors.\nWhen inmates are added and released from Suicide Watch, an email and a phone call is made to Warden and the Operations Lieutenant notifying them of the addition or termination of the watch as well as their need for cellmates. This recommendation is also placed in the Post Suicide Watch Report in PDS and the psychologist indicates exactly who they contacted about the inmate's need for a cellmate in the recommendation section of the report.\nSuicide Watch Books are reviewed daily by a psychologist and audited to see if the Unit Officer and Lieutenant make appropriate rounds and signed the log books each shift (MW, DW, and EW). Inconsistencies are sent to the Captain and Associate Warden of Programs.\nCorrectional Systems\nSince September 9, 2019, inmates have been tracked when released from court by utilizing the PP63 Sentry function as opposed to tracking by out count. There has been no issues to date utilizing this procedure.\nAll releases are being reviewed by a higher authority other than the CSO/SCSS. Typically reviewed by the Case Management Coordinator.\nCorrectional Programs\nInmate Accountability:\nNew bed books have been provided to each unit. A daily schedule of bed book counts has been established to ensure appropriate accountability of all inmates. Bed book counts are notated in the Daily Lieutenant Logs for Executive Staff review. Additionally, an Executive Staff member is present each evening to monitor this process and identify discrepancies. All discrepancies are typically corrected immediately.",
