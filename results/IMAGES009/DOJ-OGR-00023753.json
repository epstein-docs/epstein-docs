  "full_text": "The request for the meeting should be sent to both MCC and MDC Legal Departments. MDC Brooklyn's Legal Department fax number is (718) 840-4250.\n\n12. Foreign Attorneys\n\nAttorneys who are not licensed in a state or jurisdiction of the United States must provide verification of their status as a licensed attorney in good standing in a foreign jurisdiction, prior to their initial visit. Foreign attorneys should contact their respective Consulate Office, who will provide the attorney official documentation (raised seal for most countries) stating that the individual is in fact an attorney in good standing in that country. The attorney must provide to the MCC New York Legal Department, the original letter from his or her consulate verifying the foreign attorney's status as a licensed attorney in good standing. Once the status of the foreign attorney has been confirmed, that attorney will be processed as a legal visitor for future visits for one year only. The attorney may request to be placed on the list on an annual basis by following the above described procedure.\n\n13. Social Visitors\n\nSee www.bop.gov, MCC New York Visiting Regulations.\n\nB. Telephone Calls\n\n1. Unmonitored Telephone Calls\n\nInmates may place unmonitored telephone calls to their attorneys. See 28 C.F.R. ยง540.105; and Program Statement 5264.07, Sec.8, Telephone Regulations for Inmates. All housing units, excluding Special Housing Unit (SHU), have access to unmonitored telephones with a direct connection to the SDNY Federal Public Defenders' Office. Some units also have unmonitored telephones with a direct connection to the EDNY Federal Public Defenders' Office. If the inmate's attorney cannot be contacted on the provided telephones, the inmate must specifically request Unit Team staff assistance in writing. The Unit Team staff will review the request, and if approved, the call may be placed from the Unit Team's unmonitored telephones. In order to receive an unmonitored attorney call, the inmate or the inmate's attorney must request Unit Team approval, demonstrating that other correspondence, visiting, and normal telephone use is inadequate.\n\nInmate requests for unmonitored attorney calls are carefully reviewed insofar as important Bureau interests are not affected. Frequent unmonitored telephone calls increase an inmate's opportunity to pursue illegal activities without detection. Additionally, staff time and attention is unfairly focused on the single inmate receiving numerous unmonitored telephone calls at the expense of the many other inmates on a caseload.\n\nPage 10 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-00023753",
