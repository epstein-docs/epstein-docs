Normally, I would never release such information without first ensuring that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere with their investigation. Of course, you may have already done that, but in any event that is between you and them and not my business.\nHugh\nSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone\n-------- Original message --------\nFrom: [redacted] (OAG)\nDate: 8/11/19 7:00 PM (GMT-05:00)\nTo: Hugh Hurwitz\nSubject: timeline\nHugh/Ray: Can you verify that the information below is accurate? It's based in large part on the timeline you sent.\nIs there any reason why this information shouldn't be released to the public?\nOn July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.\nOn July 29th after daily interaction with Epstein, and according to established procedures, MCC-New York Psychology Services Department determined he no longer warranted placement on suicide watch. Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a requirement that he have a cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9th. In addition, the SHU confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks.\nOn August 9th at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein's cellmate was taken out of the institution for a Court appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not return to the institution. On August 9th.
