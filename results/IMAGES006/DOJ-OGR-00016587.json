Q. Thank you, Professor Loftus. Please tell the jury what your present occupation is. A. I'm currently a professor at the University of California-Irvine, the Irvine campus. My title is distinguished professor. And I have appointments in a department called psychological science, that's a psychology department; I have an appointment in criminology, law, and society, that's kind of a criminology department; and I'm also a faculty member in the law school. Q. How long have you been at UC-Irvine? A. I joined the faculty in 2002, so it's coming on 20 years. Q. And prior to joining the faculty at Irvine, had you been on the faculty of any other university? A. Yes. Prior to UC-Irvine, I was a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle for something like 29 years. Prior to that, I spent a few years on the faculty at the graduate faculty at the New School for Social Research here in the city. And prior to that I was in graduate school. Q. Focusing on graduate school, please tell the members of the jury what degrees you have academically. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016587",
