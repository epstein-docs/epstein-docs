What other open issues do we have\n3 that we can deal with now, counsel?\n4 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think there are some\n5 issues with this first witness that I just want to raise with\n6 the Court first.\n7 THE COURT: That I have briefing on?\n8 MR. EVERDELL: These are things that we've tried to\n9 talk with the government about. I don't think it's going to be\n10 a major dispute.\n11 THE COURT: Okay. I just wanted to make sure I hadn't\n12 missed it.\n13 MR. EVERDELL: You did not miss anything.\n14 THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.\n15 MR. EVERDELL: The first witness is Ms. Espinosa.\n16 THE COURT: Right.\n17 MR. EVERDELL: So the first issue, which I think the\n18 government and the defense agree on, is that there's a line of\n19 cross that we ask the government if they plan to get into, and\n20 they have agreed that they won't. And that's related to the\n21 following, which is that Ms. Galindo was a defendant in a civil\n22 lawsuit by one of the Epstein -- not one of the accusers in\n23 this case, but a different person. And so I've asked the\n24 government that they not get into that; they've agreed that\n25 they won't cross Ms. Espinosa about that.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00016506",
