MENNINGER: I think we will be done, your Honor. 6 I am looking at my co-counsel. We've had to -- we have to make 7 a couple of inquiries because your Honor ruled this morning on 8 anonymity, and there may be some other issues that we have to 9 figure out whether that will carry forward to Monday or not. 10 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, sorry to interrupt. 11 There may be one witness that does carry over to 12 Monday. We have to figure that out. But our goal, I think, is 13 to try to wrap up, with the exception of this one potential 14 witness, by tomorrow. 15 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, may I have a moment? 16 THE COURT: Yes. 17 (Counsel conferred) 18 MR. EVERDELL: I think if we went over in the morning, 19 even if we had this one witness, it would be very brief, so we 20 could have almost a full day on Monday. 21 THE COURT: Okay. 22 So finishing tomorrow or a very short witness on 23 Monday means closings on Monday and then charge and to the 24 jury. Okay. I'll permit that so long as it does not interfere 25 with that schedule. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016722",
