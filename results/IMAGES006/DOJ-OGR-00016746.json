We have honored deadlines that are issued with very short notice, we have conferred repeatedly, we are trying to work out stipulations for a number of witnesses. I understand trying to run the trial quickly and efficiently, but to be honest, your Honor, it is a lot of work. THE COURT: I am aware of that, Ms. Menninger. My point is a nonresponsive witness is not a little thing. MS. MENNINGER: There have been -- I mean, I don't know the number, but 40 witnesses, your Honor. We are working -- we've been flying people across the country, across the pond. Our client's life is on the line and we're being given one day it to put on a defense, one and a half days, and there is one witness that we're having problems with. We're not asking for some weeks' long delay. THE COURT: So far, I have nothing. MS. MENNINGER: I have made an oral application, your Honor. I understand we will get someone working on a written one right away. THE COURT: Give me a written application, give me a proposed order within a half an hour. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I need to resist the characterization that the defendant has just made. The defense has had an extraordinary amount of time between the resting of the government's case and putting on their case. They have had SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
