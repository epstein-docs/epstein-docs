A. That class, it was typically, I believe, four days; two days of ground school, and two or three days of flight. It could be four to five days, if memory serves. Q. And those training sessions that you're referring to in Dallas, you said, took place every year you recall, right? A. Every year is a requirement for us as pilots. Q. Do you remember when in the year those took place? A. I do not. I remember it being warm, not extremely cold, so I would have to do the summer months; but, you know, the dates escape me without any documentation of when we took the courses. Q. Okay. You guys had fun on those trips, right? A. The training was hard, but we tried to make the best of it. Q. I mean, you occasionally went out to a steak dinner while you were there together? A. Yes, we did. Q. Those were fun events, right? A. Yes. Q. Now, once Ghislaine had her pilot's license, her helicopter pilot's license -- A. Yes. Q. -- she flew Epstein's helicopter; is that right?
