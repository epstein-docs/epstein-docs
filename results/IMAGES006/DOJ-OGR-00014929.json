I think that certain things -- some psychologists use clinical judgment on whether or not a perpetrator's behaviors are considered grooming. But that certainly doesn't at all reference the scientific literature to determine what is and is not considered grooming. In addition, we also have data that's been provided by offenders themselves.\n\n2 In terms of reliability and validity of these judgments, the validity in psychological science refers to the degree to which you are measuring this particular thing, what you think you're measuring. So for example, the degree to which there is significant overlap between what victims say they experience and what offenders say that they have done provides us with a measure of validity.\n\n3 The degree to which different groups of individuals, whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims agree in studies what it is that -- the process, what kinds of behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what kinds of behaviors are associated with the grooming process, to the extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of reliability. Because you're getting different studies, different groups, different samples where there's significant overlap in what this dynamic and what this concept is.\n\n4 MS.
