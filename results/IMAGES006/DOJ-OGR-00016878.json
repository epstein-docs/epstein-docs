It was an application that you asked to respond to at -- I think it was 3 6 o'clock last night. So I didn't get your response on that 4 until 6 o'clock last night. I ruled as fast as I could, which 5 meant last night, I think it was probably after 11:00 p.m. or 6 close to midnight, but thought it was important to give that 7 resolution as soon as I could once the issue was raised and I 8 had full briefing. 9 10 Even if there hadn't been an application to preclude that witness, you hadn't taken steps to enforce the subpoena 11 until 11:55 a.m. today. I'm going to look at the materials, 12 but I just want to have the factual record that I need to make 13 a determination. 14 15 MS. MENNINGER: I can email chambers as soon as I 16 gather the dates and times of the communication efforts. I can 17 put that in a writing, this way your Honor has a factual record 18 on it. 19 MS. MOE: Just with respect to developing a record on 20 this issue, I just want to make sure it's clear that when we 21 produced 3500 materials, we designated them for testifying 22 witnesses, which was a much narrower scope. Accompanied with 23 that, I think, earlier than October, was a letter identifying 24 the particular victims in this case. The materials with 25 respect to Jane talked about the very, very limited number of SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016878",
