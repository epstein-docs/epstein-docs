  "full_text": "January 7, 1996\nI got back from my trip to NY today. I had such a great time it is really depressing to be back home. I feel like it was a trip that changed my whole outlook on life. I guess I always felt that way a little bit when I get back from trips - but it is overwhelming this time. I am so ready to be out of high school and in college. Everything seems so silly - going out, etc. - it did a little before anyway - I even feel a little isolated from my friends. Before I left I was on a high of how great my friends were. I still realize how wonderful they are but I feel more independent - like they aren't necessary. I felt like this when I got back from Mexico and it faded quickly but I have a feeling it is different this time. New York is such an amazing city. I felt really comfortable there - like I knew that I belonged there & would live there hopefully soon. I miss [DOJ REDACTION] so much already it seems unfair that I can't see her more often. I feel like I'm missing so much. There is so much to tell about the trip. I don't have time to begin. The best highlight was when [DOJ REDACTION] I saw Phantom of the Opera - We went to Jeff Epstein's house & had champagne w/ him. I found him down to earth & easy to talk to. I thanked him so much for the trip, etc. We then took ~",
