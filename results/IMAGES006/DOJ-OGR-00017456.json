For example, Epstein had an assistant with that same first 3 name; isn't that right? 4 A. That is correct. 5 Q. And it was spelled the same way, wasn't it? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. And you met that person, didn't you? 8 A. Yes, I did. 9 MR. EVERDELL: One moment, your Honor. 10 Your Honor, I apologize for the delay. We have a 11 slight choreography issue that we're dealing with here. I 12 wonder if it might be appropriate if we could take a brief 13 break to deal with it or I can try to do it without the issues 14 of the choreography. 15 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think a brief break would 16 help with the choreography. I apologize. 17 THE COURT: You mean to send the jury back to the jury 18 room? 19 MS. COMEY: I think that might be necessary, your 20 Honor. There is an exhibit that needs to be submitted under 21 seal instead of on the screens. 22 THE COURT: Okay. Is it possible to move past this 23 moment and then return to it later? 24 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, actually, we can do that. 25 If I'm permitted to fix the problem and then display it later, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017456",
