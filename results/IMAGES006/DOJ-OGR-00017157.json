They've got a list of massage oils. Ghislaine Maxwell wasn't in town when that list of massage oils was created. They've got a household manual that wasn't on Ghislaine Maxwell's computer, by the way. No one's explained where that thing came from, but it's dated in 2005. There's an email between Ghislaine Maxwell and another woman talking about the household manual and also about what a terrible job Juan Alessi was doing. That's the one email off of those hundreds of hard drives you saw and the pictures, one email the government brought you for a ten-year conspiracy, complaining about Juan Alessi's job performance. What a smoking gun. The Palm Beach detectives came and they told you about their walk-through at the Palm Beach house, the one that showed the massage room, which was really the master bedroom -- bathroom, excuse me. There is no creepy animals that she talked about or orgy paintings on the wall. They brought you the massage table which proved nothing to you. They showed you that photo up close of the girl with her pants being pulled down that was on the wall. Go back and compare that with the other photos. That's the same girl that Eva Dubin identified as her daughter in the other photos in the house, okay. This isn't child pornography. This is a photo that was given to Jeffrey Epstein by Eva Dubin of his goddaughter. Photo doesn't prove anything. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017157",
