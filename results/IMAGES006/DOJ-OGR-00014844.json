  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 779 Filed 08/22/22 Page 97 of 101 97 M6s2Max2 supervised release on Counts Three and Four and five years on Count Six, all to run concurrently, for a total of five years of supervised release. Defense counsel indicated no objection to the conditions of supervised release indicated in the presentence report, and so I impose them precisely as stated in the presentence report, including the standard conditions, special conditions, and mandatory conditions of supervised release. Again, I am imposing them precisely as stated in the PSR. I order Ms. Maxwell to pay a fine in the amount of $750,000. The maximum amount per count is $250,000, so that is $750,000 total. As I have indicated, I reject the contention that the defendant is unable to pay a fine. Ms. Maxwell has received a $10 million bequest from Epstein. This is in addition to her other assets. And the defendant, I conclude, is able to afford a substantial fine, and I conclude that the maximum amount per count is reasonable under all relevant circumstances in light of the counts of conviction. The government has indicated that it is not seeking restitution nor forfeiture. I am imposing a mandatory special assessment, as I must, of $100 per count, which is due immediately. Does either counsel know of any legal reason, other than those already argued, why the sentence shall not be imposed as stated? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014844",
