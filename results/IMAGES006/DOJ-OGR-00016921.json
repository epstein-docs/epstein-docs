Thank you.\nMembers of the jury, that closes the evidence portion of the trial.\nLet me tell you what comes next.\nClosing arguments are summation by the parties. Both sides will have an opportunity to summarize for you their view of the evidence in the case and the arguments they wish you to consider. Following that, I'll instruct you as to the law that you'll follow during your deliberations and then you'll begin your deliberations.\nMonday, I'm going to ask that we start at 9:00 a.m. instead of 9:30. And I want you -- I believe we'll finish at our normal time, but there is a possibility that, just to get through what we need to do on Monday, we may go a little bit later. So I'm going to ask you to arrange to be here as late as 6:00 p.m. If that is a problem, on your way out tonight, let Ms. Williams know, and we won't do that. I want to stick to my promise to the schedule, but if everybody is able to stay as late as 6:00 on Monday, that might help us ensure that we can get done what we want to do in one day.\nSo again, Monday, 9:00 a.m., the parties will do their closing arguments, their summations, then I'll instruct you as to the law, and then the deliberations will begin.\nSo 9:00 a.m. on Monday. If staying until 6:00 on Monday is a hardship, please let Ms. Williams know on your way\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016921",
