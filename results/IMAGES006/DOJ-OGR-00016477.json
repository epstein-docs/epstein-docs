And\n4 they are already getting some time off. They may be\n5 disinclined to want to come back. And that could inure to the\n6 disadvantage of both parties, I understand.\n7\n8 But I think we would not want to be in a position\n9 where the jury basically had one day prior to Christmas\n10 holiday, and I would ask the Court to be mindful of that, as I\n11 am sure you are. And that was one of the reasons why early on\n12 when we were hopeful that we could begin this case earlier\n13 because of our concern that it was going to bump up, now\n14 clearly we are way ahead of what the schedule is. But I would\n15 ask the Court to take into consideration that concern that we\n16 have.\n17 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Moe?\n18 MS.

There's no reason for\n26 the jury not to be permitted to deliberate. I think it would\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00016477",
