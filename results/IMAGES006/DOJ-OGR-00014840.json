Ms. Maxwell is over 60 years old. This is her first conviction. Neither in arguing for pretrial detention nor with respect to sentencing has the government contended that Ms. Maxwell represents a continuing danger to the public. As I explained, I do not need to find she is a continuing danger to apply 4B1.5(b), as her decade-long pattern of predatory activity amply justifies that enhancement and a substantial sentence, but her present lack of dangerousness is a factor in my consideration of a proper sentence.\nHer sentencing submission letters and psychological report discuss the impacts of an overbearing and demanding father and the tragic death of her brother at the beginning of her life. The record indicates that she has engaged in some charitable works, including environmental conservation and health-related charitable organizing and giving.
