And once Biaggi's testimony had been released, the Circuit elaborated in a supplemental opinion: In demanding that a court review his testimony, Biaggi had misleadingly implied to the public that he had answered every question before the grand jury. In fact, Biaggi had refused to answer 17 questions. Id. at 494. In these “special circumstances,” the Circuit stated, “the public interest required” disclosure of Biaggi's testimony—in other words, to put the lie to Biaggi's false account. Id.

Application of the In re Craig Factors In cases involving grand jury testimony of significant historical or public interest, In re Craig supplies a framework for evaluating whether disclosure, on balance, is warranted.
