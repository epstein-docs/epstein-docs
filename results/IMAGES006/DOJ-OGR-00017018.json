STERNHEIM: I'm going to wait until you finish and then I'll -- THE COURT: What I'd like to do, when we meet, before the jury comes in tomorrow -- not tomorrow -- Monday, as much as I'd like to do it tomorrow. We'll meet at 8:30 on Monday, and I would like to get on the record the parties' agreement as to exactly what's going back to the jury, and Ms. Williams will give you our -- actually, we'll try to get that to you today or tomorrow -- list of what we have as admitted exhibits, and you can agree or tell us if we've got anything wrong. And I'll get your agreement on that list of admitted exhibits as well. Go ahead. MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you, Judge. My recommendation for efficiency purposes would be for the parties to agree on what portions of the transcript should be redacted in case the jury wants it, so that we don't have to do readback and then make copies of the transcript could go in. MS. COMEY: Agreed, your Honor. THE COURT: That is understood. Absolutely. So you'll have that ready by Monday. MS. STERNHEIM: Yes. THE COURT: Great. Thank you. Yes. And it is my practice to get that agreement and then send the paper back. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017018",
