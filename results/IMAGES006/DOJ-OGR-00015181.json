After the play we walked around the Para and went home. It was so much fun. I met [DOJ REDACTION] and they Mendilton he was different than I expected - pretty nice, but they didn't get alone very well too at the beg. which made me annoyed w/ him. he turned out to be pretty cool once he chilled out. his brother Eric was 25 and we hung out w/ him a lot. the 4 of us went to their cabin. we had a lot of fun - X-country ski, watched Sleuth [blacked out] movie & hung out. see him again until Friday we went to a club to watch some bands, to a bar",
