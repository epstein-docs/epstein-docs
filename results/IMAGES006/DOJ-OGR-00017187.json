The defense spent most of their time attacking Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie, and now it's obvious why they did that. Those four witnesses gave you the most damning testimony in this trial. If you believe those women, then that's it, the defendant is guilty. So of course the defendant is spewing out anything they can think of to attack these women. I'm not going to respond to every single sideshow that Ms. Menninger tried to lead you down about each of these women, but let me just address a few of the most obviously false ones. First, there is literally no evidence in this record of an age limit at the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund. That's something Ms. Menninger just made up. There is nothing in the record to say you have to be a particular age to put in a claim to that fund. Second, the suggestion that Annie was 17, not 16 when she went to Santa Fe. Three different witnesses, Annie, her mother, and her high school boyfriend all remember that Annie took that Thailand trip the summer between her junior and her senior year. David Mulligan remembered she had just gotten back when they started dating and that she went after they met at junior prom. They didn't just make that up. And remember, this trip to Santa Fe with Annie took place close in time to the trip around Christmas time to New SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017187",
