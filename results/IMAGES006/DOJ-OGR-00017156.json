Let's take a minute on Stephen Flatley. He's the computer forensic guy. And he's the one that pulled the metadata that the government just showed you on their closing. And they are trying to argue that these documents, because they came from a computer that was loaded up originally by Ghislaine Maxwell, that she wrote every document on that computer. You know what's easy as can be, doesn't take the FBI to do it? You just pull up the dates of that metadata when those documents were created, and you look and see from the flight logs where Ghislaine Maxwell was when those documents were created. And she's in about four or five different places. So whoever had that desktop computer Stephen Flatley told you about wasn't carrying it with them on airplanes. And if other people could use that Ghislaine Maxwell computer, what on earth makes the government think that Ghislaine Maxwell was writing an essay about herself in the third person with Jeffrey Epstein? You don't know about that document. Not one single person told you what that document is, where it came from. You got some metadata from a computer that's clearly being used by a number of different people, because Ghislaine Maxwell is not in the house when documents are being created. But the FBI didn't put that together for you. They want to just say, This is Ghislaine Maxwell's SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017156",
