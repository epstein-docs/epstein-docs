Was it part of your job to help Ghislaine do all this? A. It was part of my job to, yes. Ghislaine would tell me who she needed to talk to in a day, whether it be landscapers, designers, interior decorators. Q. So just focusing on that particular project with the island, how big a job was that to get the island up and running? A. It was more than full-time, in my eyes. Q. And how long did that project last? A. Months. I don't even know that it ever finished, to be honest. Q. So just broadly speaking, how big a job, from your observation, how big a job was it for Ghislaine to manage all of these properties for Mr. Epstein? A. It was a huge job. Q. Did she work hard? A. Yes. Q. And in connection with her responsibilities, did she ever have to travel to the properties to manage them? A. Sure. Q. And how often did she travel to do that? A. Well, she traveled on a weekly basis for the most part. I can't say, you know, when she went to each house for what purpose. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016532",
