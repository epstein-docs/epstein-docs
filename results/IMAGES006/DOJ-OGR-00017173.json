  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 152 of 257 LCKCmax7 2986 Summation - Ms. Menninger charges against her. And Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove her innocence to you. You already know it to be true as you sit there. It is the government's burden to prove each element of each of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Those of you that have worked in regulatory jobs or banking or finance will be familiar with regulations and how there are knit-picky rules. The Judge is going to give you the law. That's the law that you'll follow. You'll get those instructions and you need to follow those rules, each one of them, very carefully, because if the government has failed to prove any element of any count beyond a reasonable doubt, no matter how silly or small it might seem to you, the Judge will instruct you, you have to acquit. You only convict if you find the burden of proof has been met as to each element of each count. Reasonable doubt is something I've talked a little bit about and the Judge, I expect, will give you the instruction that you see here. So I'm just trying to point out a couple of pieces of it, but obviously you'll need to read the entire instruction and listen to all of the Judge's instructions because they're all important. But when you're weighing the credibility of the witnesses that you've heard from and you're evaluating whether the government has met its burden of proof as to each element of each count, you are to weigh whether or not the government has satisfied their proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
