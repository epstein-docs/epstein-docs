What we're offering is not a travel record. I think the photograph that was offered by defense counsel is of an adult. The testimony with that person was a person -- so her date of birth makes clear that she couldn't have been a personal assistant as an underage girl given her date of birth and given the timing. This would have been in the 2000s. THE COURT: Rebuttal relevance, I think, is apparent. So I will allow it and we can do it now. MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. THE COURT: What else can I take up? MS. MOE: Nothing from the government, your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Williams will check on the juror members. While we're gathering that, I would like to speak to the parties at sidebar just as to how to address the jury about the followup from the break yesterday.
