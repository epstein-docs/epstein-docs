They are not going to be able to pinpoint dates; they are going to tell stories that have changed over time and grown over time, stories that they have told for the first time after Epstein died. And Ghislaine has been inserted in those stories as they reframed their stories for a payday. Now, they will come in here and they will point their finger at Ghislaine Maxwell. There is nobody else to point the finger at this trial. And I ask you to consider, when you hear their testimony, those core themes that I mentioned before: Memory, manipulation, and money. Now, the four women who will come here -- and, as you heard, they are permitted to have pseudonyms or not have their whole names used -- are Jane, Annie, Kate, and Carolyn. They don't have contemporaneous records, they don't have notes of the things they are going to say. Unlike you, as Judge Nathan said, you could keep notes to aid your recollection.
