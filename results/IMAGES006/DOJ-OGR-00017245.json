Three, between in or about 2001 and in or about 2004, Epstein's employees sent Carolyn gifts, including lingerie from an address in the Southern District of New York to Carolyn's residence in Florida. For example, on one occasion, in or about October of 2002, Epstein caused a package to be sent by Federal Express from an address in Manhattan to Carolyn in Florida. Four, on multiple occasions between in or about 2001 and in or about 2004, Epstein, Maxwell, or one of Epstein's other employees called Carolyn to schedule an appointment for Carolyn to massage Epstein. For example, in or about April of 2004 or May of 2004, another employee of Epstein's called Carolyn to schedule such appointments. In order for government to satisfy this element, it's not necessary for the government to prove that Ms. Maxwell committed the overt act. It is sufficient for the government to show that any of the members of the conspiracy knowingly committed some overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Further, the overt act need not be one that is alleged in the indictment. Rather, it can be any overt act that is substantially similar to those acts alleged in the indictment, if you are convinced that the act occurred while the conspiracy was still in existence and that it was done in furtherance of the conspiracy as described in the indictment.
