So there is still an open question in their minds about whether the flight to New Mexico, that travel, was for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. But they are now considering whether the flight out of New Mexico, if Ms. Maxwell had any -- did anything to do with that flight, with arranging that flight, could we convict her on that count alone. Because there is no, I think, evidence that she arranged the flight going to New Mexico; instead, they are considering now whether there's any evidence that she may have arranged the flight out of New Mexico. And is that enough to provide a conviction on Count Two? And I think the answer to that is pretty clearly no -- I'm sorry, Count Four I should have said, not Count Two. Because there's no evidence of that. And there is also -- there is no -- in the instructions themselves, that would not be a significant or motivating purpose for that travel across state lines. That would simply be for her to return home. That's not travel for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. MS. MOE: Your Honor, I think this colloquy illustrates how confusing the note is. We are now guessing at what hypothetical facts the jury is talking about; and then guessing hypothetically what their legal question is on top of that.
