You heard that from the witnesses. You know they emailed each other, you know they met up after court appearances with Jeffrey Epstein, and you heard, for example, about Jane's lawyer, Robert Glassman. He told her, before this case was ever charged, that Glassman stated before the government charged the case, Jane had discussed whether to cooperate -- and reminding you, she didn't want to cooperate before Epstein died, but he advised her that, to cooperate, would quote, help her case, meaning her civil case. She hired Robert Glassman two weeks before she first talked to the FBI in September of 2019.\n2 So these women, with their lawyers, walked into the U.S. Attorney's Office, they filed their civil lawsuits at the same time, and the lawyers, like Boies Schiller, helped set up the Epstein Victims Compensation Fund. Annie told you that. On that fund application, it asked you, are you cooperating with a criminal investigation, have you filed a civil suit, because if you are, we'll just assume you're a real victim, even though we, the fund, aren't going to ask you any questions or put your story to the test. And all of these ladies had lawyers, went to the FBI, and filed a civil suit and filed a civil claim with the fund and they each took home millions, and now they are stuck with the stories that they told.\n3 That's the money piece. Now for the manipulation, a manipulation of the truth and the evidence.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017105",
