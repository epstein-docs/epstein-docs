All right.\nSo I think then -- and then we should talk about the timing of the charge conference. Have you discussed that further? You kept promising to discuss it.\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\nWe haven't conferred with the defense about that. We continue to just defer to the Court's preference on timing.\nI think if the defense case is two to three days, then a charge conference at the conclusion of that would fit with the Court's timing. We're also happy to do that earlier. We don't have a preference as to the sequencing there.\nTHE COURT: Let me just look at the calendar.\nGo ahead, Ms. Sternheim.\nMS. STERNHEIM: I was just going to suggest that we utilize the Saturday that the Court said would be available.\nEven if we had more of a case, I think we could accomplish that, if the Court is still amenable.\nTHE COURT: Okay.
