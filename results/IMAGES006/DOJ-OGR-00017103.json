The government played you a montage of Epstein's houses, his bank accounts, his artwork, his cars, his planes, his helicopters, his bank accounts, his message pads, just like a sensationalist tabloid would. His private island, his photos, and those, ladies and gentlemen, are for things that Epstein did, things that Epstein had, and perhaps Epstein's crimes, but as we told you in our opening, Ghislaine is not Jeffrey Epstein. The government in this case has now pivoted because Epstein is not here and they said: Her, too; her, too. Ghislaine was there, she must have known. They said, let me show you a bunch of photos of them together, undated photos from unknown times with unknown hairstyles. You've seen them together. She must have known. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you heard that the government seized somewhere near 38,000 photographs, and they brought you a handful of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell together. Where are the other 37,960 photographs? Who were in those photographs? Was it other girlfriends? Was it other women? Who was it? You don't know. They didn't bring you those photos. You saw in the drawers, where these photos were kept, the binders. You saw the discs where they were kept. And they brought you the most innocuous photos of a couple that once was together, and they didn't even tell you when. This is proof of SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017103",
