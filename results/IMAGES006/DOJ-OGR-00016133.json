  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 741 Filed 08/10/22 Page 23 of 106 LBTVMAX1 27 throughout this process, this rule is very, very important. That's because your decision in this case must be made solely on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at this trial. In other words, all that you need to know will be presented here in open court by the parties. This is critically important to ensuring a fair trial, which I know that all of you would want if you were a party in this court, and I have no doubt it's what you want for the parties who are here today. I expect you to inform me immediately through Ms. Williams if you become aware of another juror's violation of these instructions. Finally, each of you either has or will be given a notebook and pen; and that's because I permit jurors to take notes. But you don't have to take notes. Notes are just an aid to your own recollection. The court reporters in this case record everything that's said in the courtroom, and any portion of the testimony can be read back to you during your deliberations. If you do take notes, be aware that note-taking may distract you from something important that's happening on the witness stand. Whether or not you take notes, rely on your own recollections and don't be influenced by the fact that another juror has taken notes. If you do take notes, all notes must be left each day in the jury room. Ms. Williams will make sure that they are secure. From this point until the time when you retire to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016133",
