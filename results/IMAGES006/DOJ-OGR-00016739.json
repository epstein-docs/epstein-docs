EVERDELL: Because they're coming from the U.K. 3 and they can't be here until Monday. 4 THE COURT: Who is it and how long? 5 MR. EVERDELL: How long is the witness going to be? 6 It would be a very short witness. And this is related to the 7 Kinnerton Street property. I think just today we got a 8 declaration from him, which I can hand over to the government. 9 They got this signed this morning about what his testimony 10 would be. And I could provide it to the Court, as well. 11 I would like it in front of me, but I could generally 12 summarize, don't quote me on this, but he is the owner of the 13 Nags Head Pub, which is right across the street from the 14 Kinnerton Street residence. He owned that for the whole time 15 that's relevant here. He knew the previous owners. He always 16 saw them there. And he met Ghislaine Maxwell when she took 17 ownership of the property, and he knew the prior owners to be 18 living there, and then he knew Ghislaine to be living there 19 when she bought the property. And he goes there every day. He 20 owned the pub, he had a flat above the pub that looked across 21 to the Kinnerton Street property, and he can verify the fact 22 that she didn't take occupancy until after she purchased the 23 apartment. 24 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would just note that the 25 defense has had an extraordinary amount of time to prepare its SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016739",
