  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 782 Filed 01/15/25 Page 3 of 158 3 LBAAMAX1ps regarding public access yesterday: The 412 piece of these proceedings will be sealed, as is expressly required by Federal Rule of Evidence 412. That rule requires certain categories of evidence to be discussed at a sealed, in camera hearing. My plan is to hold that part of the hearing last, do what we need to do with respect to logistical issues and Daubert here first, and then seal the courtroom, having everyone who is a nonparticipant leave and shutting down the overflow access at that point, as required by law. Given this, I want to address a few logistical issues at the outset, and then we'll move into Daubert. I should say, to the extent we run into any overlap during the Daubert hearing on any 412 issues, we have arranged space to do the equivalent of a sealed sidebar in the jury room, I believe. But, again, we can bifurcate. OK. Before I turn to the logistical issues, any matters I should take up with what I have indicated, Ms. Pomerantz? MS. POMERANTZ: Not from the government. Thank you. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim? MS. STERNHEIM: No. Thank you. THE COURT: OK. First, on logistics, as you know, counsel, we had a very successful return rate on the jury summons, and in the two days that the questionnaire has been filled out we had 565 prospective jurors fill it out. Given SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014879",
