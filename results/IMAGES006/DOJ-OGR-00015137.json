Maxwell, she stated, had “directly[,] repeatedly, and over the course of many years participated in a horrific scheme to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls, some as young as 14, for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein.” Id. at 89. As an example, she noted, after Carolyn had confided in Maxwell her personal history of having been raped and molested by her grandfather starting at a very young age, Maxwell used that knowledge to continue the “cycle of sexual abuse,” inducing Carolyn to give Epstein “sexualized massages” for “years,” and by herself touching Carolyn’s breasts when Carolyn was 14 years old. Id. at 90–91. Judge Nathan also noted that Maxwell had repeatedly deflected blame and lied about her offenses, including in a civil deposition and to Pretrial Services and the Court. Id. at 95.4\nE.
