The terrible impact on the lives of so many women is difficult to hear and even more difficult to absorb, both in its scale and in its extent. I want to acknowledge their suffering and empathize. I empathize deeply with all of the victims in this case. 8 I also acknowledge that I have been convicted of helping Jeffrey Epstein commit these crimes. And despite the many helpful and positive things I have done in my life, and will continue to do, to assist others during my sentence, I know that my association with Epstein and this case will forever and permanently stain me. 14 It is the greatest regret of my life that I ever met Jeffrey Epstein. I have had plenty of time to think, having spent two years in solitary confinement. I believe that Jeffrey Epstein was a manipulative, cunning, and controlling man who lived a profoundly compartmentalized life and fooled all of those in his orbit. 20 Variously, his victims considered him as a godfather, a mentor, benefactor, friend, lover. It is absolutely unfathomable today to think that that is how he was viewed contemporaneously. 24 His impact on all those who were close to him has been devastating, and today those who knew him even briefly, or SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
