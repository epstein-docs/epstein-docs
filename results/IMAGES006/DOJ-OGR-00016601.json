The prosecution is frequently the one that has -- is putting on memory testimony and maybe wants to bolster that testimony. And the testimony about memory distortion or the potential for false memories is not something that typically fits in their agenda. Q. With regard to the many hundreds of times that you've testified, have you been declared as an expert in the science of memory? A. The vast majority of those 300 cases are testimony about memory. Every now and then I have testified as an expert witness on a slightly different issue, usually having to do with human comprehension, but not necessarily memory, like how people would understand warning labels, for example. Q. And is part of your expertise related to the impact of memory on the brain? A. I talk about memory and the processes of memory. It's the neuroscientist who might be the ones who want to tell you about the hippocampus and the amygdala and how it connects to the parts of the brain. I know a little bit about that and I've included material in some of my introductory psychology textbooks about that; but I would defer to a different expert, if you're talking about matters of neuroscience. Q. Well, with regard to memory though, have you testified about these stages of memory as known in your field? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016601",
