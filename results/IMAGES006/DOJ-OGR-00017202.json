  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 181 of 257 LCKVMAX8 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey 1 If these four witnesses wanted to dirty Maxwell up for a huge payday, they would have told way better lies. 2 But, you know, let's just say the defense is right. 3 Let's say these women are lying. Given how consistent their 4 accounts are with each other and with the other witnesses in 5 this case, that would mean that at least eight people -- Jane 6 Kate, Carolyn, Annie, Dave, Shawn, Matt, and Juan Alessi -- all 7 are part of a massive conspiracy to frame the defendant. And 8 then they just happened to be lucky enough that the FBI had 9 documents to back up what they said: Flight records, FedEx 10 records, message pads, contact book, household manual to back 11 up their lies. 12 Beyond how implausible such a massive conspiracy of 13 eight people to lie in a federal court is, the timing here 14 makes it impossible. Remember, the defense's theory is that 15 the incentive to frame Maxwell arose after Epstein died in 16 2019. So this supposed frame job was hatched in 2019, meaning 17 Carolyn had to get in a time machine, go back to 2009 and 18 sprinkle in a couple references to Maxwell in her deposition. 19 And then Annie had to borrow that time machine, go back to 20 2006, and tell the FBI about how Maxwell touched her breast 21 during a massage. 22 Ladies and gentlemen, that's fiction. You know that 23 did not happen. Annie told the FBI about Maxwell because it 24 was the truth. Carolyn described Maxwell in her deposition 25 was the truth. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
