In granting the petition to unseal Greenglass' grand jury testimony, the court observed that in the 65 years that had passed since the Rosenberg trial, many believed that Ethel Rosenberg was innocent and had been framed by Greenglass. Id. at 628. As a result, and only after Greenglass had passed away, the court concluded that Greenglass' grand jury testimony should be released since it provided information in a case of historical interest to the public. Id. at 629 (holding that “the requested records are critical pieces of an important moment in our nation's history” and “the time for the public to guess what they contained should end.”). It is noteworthy that Judge Hellerstein refused to unseal the transcript while Grenglass was alive, finding that Greenglass' interest in preserving the secrecy of his grand jury testimony “was sufficient to prevent its unsealing during his life, despite the public interest in the case.” Id. at 628.\n\nIn re Petition of American Historical Association involved a similar request by historical associations in 1998 to unseal transcripts of two special grand juries convened from 1947 to 1950 pertaining to the espionage investigation of Alger Hiss. In re Am. Hist. Ass'n, 49 F. Supp. 2d 274 (S.D.N.Y. 1999). Hiss, a former high-ranking State Department official, was convicted of committing perjury in responding to allegations that he was a Soviet spy. Hiss maintained his innocence until his death and publicly suggested that his prosecution was a political hit job by Richard Nixon to mobilize public opposition to communism. Id. at 294.
