The testimony that you gave here today, would it have been any different if you had been called to the stand by the government? 3 A. I don't think -- I don't see how it would have been any different. I think in the case where I did testify for the prosecution, it was similar testimony. 4 Q. And if the prosecution had called you, you would have been available to be a witness for them, wouldn't you? 5 A. I might have been. 6 MS. STERNHEIM: No further questions. Thank you. 7 THE COURT: Ms. Pomerantz? 8 MS. POMERANTZ: No, nothing further from the government. Thank you, your Honor. 9 THE COURT: Thank you. All right. 10 Professor Loftus, you may step down.
