Because the quote was read aloud, even if the witness doesn't recall making the statement does not prohibit us from making an argument to the jury that the statement was, in fact, made to law enforcement and impeaches the witness's testimony; correct? THE COURT: If it's in the record, that inference is available to argue. Any disagreement? MS. COMEY: No objection, your Honor. MS. MENNINGER: I just want to make sure in closing arguments -- THE COURT: I totally appreciate that. And anything to avoid objections during closing argument. MS. COMEY: Obviously it's not for the truth, it's for impeachment, but no objection to that argument. MS. MENNINGER: I think impeachment is for the truth, your Honor. THE COURT: That is way more metaphysical than I can handle at this moment. MS. MENNINGER: Thank you. THE COURT: Thank you. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would note that in light of the rulings on the Annie Farmer statements, it appears that there is no longer any relevance for calling AUSA Rossmiller as a witness, and I just want to confirm that he is released from SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
