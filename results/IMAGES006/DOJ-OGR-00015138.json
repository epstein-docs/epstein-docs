Maxwell, No. 22-1426 (2d Cir. Nov. 25, 2024), Dkt. 120.\nOn April 10, 2025, Maxwell petitioned for a writ of certiorari before the Supreme Court.\nHer petition argues that Epstein's non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida barred her prosecution in this District.

If there are gaps, we will find them. If records have been hidden, we will uncover them. And we will bring everything we find to the DOJ to be fully assessed and transparently disseminated to the American people as it should be.\"\nU.S. Dep't of Just., Attorney General Pamela Bondi Releases First Phase of Declassified Epstein Files (Feb. 27, 2025), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-releases-first-phase-declassified-epstein-files [https://perma.cc/H2QZ-WZCV].5\nThe released documents are described and accessible on the DOJ's website.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-00015138",
