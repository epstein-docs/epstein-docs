Epstein's and Maxwell's strong ties to FIT could make this happen. With their help, my admission was almost assured, but there was always a but. First I had to write my application, which I did. But Maxwell had to review it and conveniently always found fault. Then another but, I needed to lose 30 pounds because I was a piglet. Maxwell's numerous degrading descriptions of me. Epstein and Maxwell put me on a strict Atkins diet while simultaneously sending me to a psychiatrist who prescribed antidepressants that caused weight gain. It was a classic no-win situation, and they knew it: Precisely what human traffickers seek. I never lost the weight, my application was never good enough, and it never got submitted.

I'm hypervigilant. I do not trust people easily. I experience dramatic mood changes. I will sometimes start crying uncontrollably for reasons I cannot always comprehend. I worked hard with several mental health professionals. They have diagnosed me with extreme symptoms of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, PTSD and tendency to self-harm.
