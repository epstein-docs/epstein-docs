  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 209 of 257 3043 LCKVMAX8 Charge it's a theory of liability that permits a defendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself committing the crime, assisted another person or persons in committing the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and Six, therefore, the defendant can be convicted either if she committed the crime herself or if another person committed the crime and the defendant aided and abetted that person to commit that crime. Under the federal aiding and abetting statute, whoever \"aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures\" the commission of an offense is punishable as a principle. You should give those words their ordinary meaning. A person aids or abets a crime if she knowingly does some act for the purpose of aiding or encouraging the commission of that crime with the intention of causing the crime charged to be committed. \"To counsel\" means to give advice or recommend. \"To induce\" means to lead or move by persuasion or influence as to some action or state of mind. \"To procure\" means to bring about by unscrupulous or indirect means. \"To cause\" means to bring something about to effect something. In other words, it's not necessary for the government to show that Ms. Maxwell herself physically committed the crime charged in order for you to find her guilty. This is because a person who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of a crime is just as guilty of that offense as if she committed it SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
