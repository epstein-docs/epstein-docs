He was confident there was no way to move it. He said he could cancel it, they would lose money, it was a burden, he was distracted by it, so I had to excuse juror number 58.\n\nAll our other jurors are here. They're just finishing up settling in. So we can proceed as soon as Ms. Williams brings them out.\n\nAnything to take up?\n\nMS. COMEY: No, thank you, your Honor.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: I think they'll be ready momentarily. So I'll sit.\n\nMS. COMEY: Your Honor, would you like the witness in the witness box?\n\nTHE COURT: That would be great. Thank you.\n\n(Witness present)\n\nWe need about two more minutes.\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00017371",
