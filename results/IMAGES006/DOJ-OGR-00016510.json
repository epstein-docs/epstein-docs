THE COURT: All right. What else? MR. EVERDELL: I don't think anything from the defense at the moment, your Honor. MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing from the government, your Honor. THE COURT: We have one more juror we're waiting on. Oh, while we have a moment, so I did work out logistics for the charging conference. We can do Saturday at 9 a.m. in this courtroom. And as I said, the DE and other courthouse staff will ensure significant public access. We'll have room in the courtroom and in overflow courtrooms for the charging conference. Anything else? MR. EVERDELL: Sorry, I did forget one thing. With respect to those photos, your Honor, if they do get admitted, there's only one copy of each. So my plan on publishing them to the jury would be to just walk down the jury row with the photos so they can see them, because we don't have physical -- we just got them this morning; we don't have copies of the photos. THE COURT: You can't run off some copies? MR. EVERDELL: We can try in the meantime. THE COURT: Okay. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016510",
