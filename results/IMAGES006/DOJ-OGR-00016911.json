MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, the government and I had spoken about this. And if it's amenable to the Court -- they haven't spoken yet, but we can talk about this after. THE COURT: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. All right. We'll bring in the jury. MS. COMEY: Yes. Thank you, your Honor. MS. STERNHEIM: We were going to suggest also beginning at 9. And whether the Court would inquire of the jury if they would be willing to stay a little later so that we can complete everything on Monday. THE COURT: Okay. You don't mean extended time for deliberations, you mean the closings. MS. STERNHEIM: No, I mean to do the closing arguments. THE COURT: You pushed it off. Yes. MS. STERNHEIM: Closing arguments, rebuttal, charge. THE COURT: And what's your best estimate? We'll do a shortened lunch too, because we presumably won't have issues to work through. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we estimate that the summation argument for Ms. Moe will be between two and three hours. My rebuttal, it's hard to estimate. I doubt it would be more than 45 minutes at most.
