Instruction No. 22. Count Four. Transportation of an individual under the age of 17 to engage in illegal sexual activity. Third element. The third element of Count Four which the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell knew that Jane was less than 17 years old at the time of the acts alleged in Count Four of the indictment.
