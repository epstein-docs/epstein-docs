A couple of quick details about my I didn't mention earlier - went to see The Duchess of Duke play, & Blue Man group/Tubes off Broadway really cool production. Went to the fleamarket where I got some cool stuff, went to Jeffrey Epstein's Mansion, went to the Met, a pretty fun New Year's Eve party, went to thrift stores where I got an amazing dress for prom, it's from the 'fifties, lace with pink flowers w/ rhinestones in the middle all over it, it is my dream dress. One night we went to the movies w/ Jeffrey Epstein - it was a little weird one of those things that is weird hard to explain we were sitting next to each other & he put out his hand for me to hold & we were holding hands (not weird, normal & fine) then he kind of caressed/rubbed my arm & shoulder/foot - It was one of those things that just gave me a weird feeling but wasn't that weird & probably normal - the one thing that kind of weirded me out about it was he let go of my hand when he was talking to [REDACTED] which I decided it was no big deal. It just made me mad because he is being so amazing - paying for a summer program for me & helping me w/ college he is so nice & so generous w/ everything I just didn't want to have any weird feelings about it - I didn't/couldn't say anything.",
