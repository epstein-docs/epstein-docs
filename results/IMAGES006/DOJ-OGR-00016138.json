It was the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n9 The defendant took these girls on shopping trips,\n10 asked them about their lives, their schools, their families.\n11 She won their trust. She discussed sexual topics with them.\n12 She helped normalize abusive sexual conduct. She put them at\n13 ease and made them feel safe all so that they could be molested\n14 by a middle-aged man.\n15 She knew what was going to happen to those girls. The\n16 defendant walked the girls into a room where she knew that man\n17 would molest them, and there were times when she was in the\n18 room when it happened, making it all feel normal and casual.\n19 That is why we are here today, because between 1994\n20 and 2004, the defendant sexually exploited young girls.
