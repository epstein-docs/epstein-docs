THE COURT: Okay. Let me just articulate these. MR. EVERDELL: That's fine. THE COURT: So Instruction No. 34 on lines 4, 6, 15, and 19, we're going to replace \"minors\" with \"individuals under the age of 17.\" MR. EVERDELL: And there's one on line 10 as well, your Honor. MR. ROHRBACH: As well as line 13, your Honor. THE COURT: Come on. The clerks are good, but, you know, it's Saturday, after all. We'll do a search and replace also, but I think it is worth doing, since some of them are under 17 and some are under 18. MR. EVERDELL: That's right, your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. So let me just repeat. So Instruction 34, lines 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, and 19, we will replace \"minors\" with \"individuals under the age of 17.\" MR. EVERDELL: Correct, your Honor. THE COURT: And then moving to replacing the word \"minor\" with \"an individual under the age of 18,\" Mr. Everdell, that's line 24. MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: And what else?
