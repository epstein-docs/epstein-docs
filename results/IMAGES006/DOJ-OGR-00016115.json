STERNHEIM: Thank you.\n10 I think Mr. Everdell has an issue.\n11 MR. EVERDELL: Yes. Thank you, your Honor.\n12 Just a matter of choreography. Assuming we do get to\n13 witnesses today, pursuant to the Court's instructions, we have\n14 a binder of materials for the witness. Once cross begins,\n15 we'll need to take just a brief break to deliver the binder to\n16 the witness box. And I believe for the first witness we may\n17 have some manila folders to hand out to the jurors which we\n18 would instruct them not to look at until they are instructed to\n19 do.\n20 THE COURT: Okay. And does this overlap with the\n21 request put in yesterday regarding using video for cross?\n22 MR. EVERDELL: It does, your Honor. We have prepared\n23 as if we need binders. We still would like that request to be\n24 considered so that we can use electronic, but we have prepared\n25 the first couple witnesses with binders.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016115",
