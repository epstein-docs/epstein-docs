You saw the\n2    witnesses yourself. They were not talking about one time that\n3    they saw a fake car crash. They were telling you about how\n4    they were sexually abused again and again and again. You heard\n5    them tell you about their worst memories, and that's why this\n6    is a case about memory.\n7        As jurors, you understand how memory works from your\n8    own lives, and that's how you know it just doesn't make any\n9    sense to say that Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate all\n10   imagined this, or that they're experiencing some kind of false\n11   memory of something that never happened. Again and again at\n12   this trial you saw the lengths the defense went to in order to\n13   try to discredit the witnesses, because their testimony was\n14   devastating evidence of Maxwell's guilt.\n15       I want to talk about that for just a moment. Let's\n16   talk about just two examples.\n17       Remember that in a cross-examination of Jane, when the\n18   defense repeatedly tried to suggest that Jane had said on her\n19   application to Interlochen that nothing was difficult for her?\n20   This is Defense Exhibit J-3. This went on for question after\n21   question, as the defense tried to suggest that Jane was lying\n22   about her difficult home life. Here it is.
