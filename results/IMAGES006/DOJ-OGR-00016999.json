And I don't think a jury is going to be confused or misled about why that testimony was offered. So I don't think there is a need for this sort of instruction. THE COURT: Do you have any examples of it being used? MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't have at my fingertips. I can try to find some if there are. THE COURT: This is my standard credibility instruction. Certainly given in multiple trials in which felony convictions came in. I don't think I've ever given it or been asked to give it. MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I would point out, I think in a lot of trials, maybe in the ones you've done before, there was probably an instruction about cooperating witnesses which builds in this language, and obviously you don't have one here, so it's often included in the charge in a separate instruction. THE COURT: Well, this is a new request. I'll take a look. We'll look at it. And when I send you the redline you'll either see it or not. MR. EVERDELL: In the meantime, your Honor, I'll try to find other examples if I can. THE COURT: OK. Looks like I have given it as a separate instruction, testimony of felons. \"You've heard the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016999",
