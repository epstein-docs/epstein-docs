And give the jury just a sampling of what kind of organizations those are. A. Well, one of my primary organizations with which I affiliate is the Association for Psychological Science. This is an organization primarily of academic university research psychologists, although there are many clinical researchers who also belong to the organization. I was president of that organization in 1998-ish. I'm a member of the Western Psychological Association. This is the organization in psychology that covers the western region of the United States; so it's California, Oregon, Washington, maybe Hawaii, and possibly some other states on the west coast. And I was twice president of the Western Psychological Association. So those are just a couple of the organizations that I affiliate with. I've been president of a couple of the divisions of the American Psychological Association in the past, like the American Psychology Law Society, and have served in other roles for other organizations, not president. Q. Moving on to publications. During the course of your career, have you published articles and journals? A. Yes. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016594",
