What does that prove to you? Then there's Virginia Roberts. The government wants to try to claim that Virginia Roberts was also a victim. Where is Virginia Roberts? Why didn't Virginia Roberts come and get on the stand and tell you that she was a victim? Use your common sense. If she could corroborate Carolyn, you think they might have had her come in and do that? What the government just told you is that Ghislaine Maxwell basically picked her up off the side of the road. That's not what you heard. Juan Alessi told you he -- Ghislaine Maxwell went to get a treatment at the spa at Mar-a-Lago, and Virginia Roberts came out wearing a white uniform, as though she worked there. And Juan Alessi also told you and said in a deposition in 2009, she was a masseuse. He understood her to be a masseuse. This isn't picking up a girl off the side of the road. And look at the records, okay. We put in Virginia Roberts' school records. She was going to Survivor Charter School from 2001 to 2002. She was 18 years old. That's where Shawn says he met her. And in 2002 is when Virginia introduced Carolyn to Epstein, when she was 18 years old. So Virginia is the one who's taking underage girls to meet Epstein, not Ghislaine Maxwell. Virginia's presence on a flight log when she was 17, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017158",
