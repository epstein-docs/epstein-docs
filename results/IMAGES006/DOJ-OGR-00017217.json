  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 196 of 257 3030 LCKVMAX8 Charge actually committed. By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that the crime charge was actually committed, but do not require proof of an agreement. Of course, if a defendant both participates in a conspiracy to commit a crime and then actually commits that crime, that defendant may be guilty of both the conspiracy and the substantive crime, as I'll instruct you shortly. We will turn first to the substantive charges in the indictment, which are more convenient to consider before the conspiracy charges. Therefore, I'll instruct you first on Counts Two, Four, and Six, and then I'll instruct you on Counts One, Three, and Five. Instruction No. 13. Count Two, enticement to engage in an illegal sexual activity, the statute. The relevant statute for Count Two is Title 18, United States Code, Section 2422, which provides that: \"Whoever knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual to travel in interstate commerce or in any territory or possession of the United States to engage in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense\" is guilty of a federal crime. Instruction No. 14. Count Two, enticement to engage in illegal sexual activity, the elements. To prove the defendant guilty of Count Two, the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017217",
