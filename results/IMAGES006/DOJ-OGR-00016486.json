THE COURT: I think this is an area ripe for narrowing and stipulation when feasible. Okay. Next is the attorney witness issue. I am prepared to give guidance on that. Okay. So I have the defense's letter to call attorneys Jack Scarola, Brad Edwards, and Robert Glassman to testify during the defense case-in-chief. And I've looked quite carefully at these arguments and proffers. Obviously I've had the one related to Mr. Glassman the longest. The defense argues that the testimony of the attorneys is relevant to show how and why the alleged victims cooperated with the prosecution in this case, which it argues is relevant to motive to testify and bias. I think the government concedes that, with the exception of Mr. Glassman's requested testimony as to whether he told Jane that cooperating would \"help her case,\" other than that, I think the government agrees that the proffered testimony is not -- at least as framed -- attorney-client privilege. I still have to exercise caution in considering the ability of defense to call these witnesses, since they are attorneys for witnesses who testified, and the boundary to privileged communications can be easily crossed. I do think as a general matter, to the extent the defense has established SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016486",
