  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 103 of 257 LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger mom, that there is not a single flight log entry with her flying with those famous people. And we'll get back to her memory being tainted by those flight logs in a second. Let's talk about her memory. She demonstrated a very poor and inconsistent memory about things that if were true, she would have remembered. Her memory is the underpinning of this entire case, because the government has to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that she was traveling, enticed to travel, encouraged to travel, transported while she was under the age of 17 in order to find Ghislaine Maxwell guilty of Counts One through Four. And the government overlooks each one of these significant memory gaps. They try to tell you, and I expect on rebuttal Ms. Comey will tell you, she was too scared to disclose the facts about what happened to her. Or, you know, we overlooked that she's telling her male lawyers all these facts for purposes of her civil suit. They brought up they had to reduce the number of people in the room so she would feel comfortable enough talking to them about it. You could judge for yourself, her lack of discomfort and talking about it on the stand. But what she said in December of 2019 and in February of 2020 was, I don't feel comfortable talking about this right now. She said, I have no specific recollection of that or I don't remember. If she doesn't remember something, the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017124",
