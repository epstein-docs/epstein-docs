POMERANTZ: Withdrawn. Q. Do you recall being asked about Jeffrey Epstein's penis several times on cross examination? A. I do. Q. In your own words, can you explain what Epstein did when he got into bed with you? MS. MENNINGER: Objection, your Honor. Asked and answered. And I was not allowed to ask the question. THE COURT: I believe the objection I sustained with you was the asked and answered question, wasn't it? MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor. THE COURT: Give me a moment. Overruled. BY MS. POMERANTZ: Q. Annie, I believe the question I had asked was: In your own words, can you explain what Epstein did when he got into bed with you? MS. MENNINGER: Objection. Calls for a narrative, your Honor.
