Partially in support, yes. Q. And this is by the same folks who did the 2020 study, Winters and Jeglic. Right? A. Yes. Q. The abstract here -- this study was actually giving professionals a list, undergraduate students a list of potential grooming behaviors to see if they could identify grooming behaviors. And there were a total of 393 undergraduate students who were provided with this information. Do you recall that? A. I don't recall specifically. I recog -- I can recall. This was the article that -- in which -- they did two things. They developed the model, which they later tested. And then they created a scenario in which they attempted to see whether or not grooming behaviors could be predicted. Q. Right. And the results of this study were that grooming behaviors could not be predicted. Correct? A. Correct. Q. And this is what ended up with the 2020 attempt to validate the model, which they're still working on. Right? A. So you're talking about two different concepts. I can't really answer that question. Q. OK. Bottom line, \"Nobody could predict grooming out of 364 people\" -- \"393 undergraduate students.\" Right? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00015017",
