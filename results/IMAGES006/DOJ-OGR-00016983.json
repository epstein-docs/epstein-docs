EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. Next. MR. EVERDELL: Same page, page 50, your Honor, line 18, just going back, these are overt acts with respect to Count Five. THE COURT: Mm-hmm. MR. EVERDELL: The third one, which begins on line 17, between -- oh, yes. \"Between in or about 2001 and in or about 2004, Epstein's employees, including at times Maxwell, sent Carolyn gifts, including lingerie, etc.\" I don't think there's any evidence in the record that Maxwell sent any gifts. In fact, I think the FedEx records show that it wasn't Maxwell sending anything. I don't think there's any testimony in the record that Maxwell was sending the gifts, so I think that should be excluded. MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine, your Honor. This is what the grand jury charged, but that is fine, given the state of the record. THE COURT: Okay. MR. ROHRBACH: But to be clear, the government is fine with including the clause -- cutting the clause \"including at times Maxwell.\" SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016983",
