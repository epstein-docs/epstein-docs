  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 779 Filed 08/22/22 Page 44 of 101 44 M6SQmax1 conviction. Visoski testified that Maxwell partially owned the jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to fly Epstein or schedule flights for herself. The evidence at trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the pilots fly victims of the conspiracy. Across the timeframe of all counts of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided personalized services that were peculiarly tailored to the defendant's offenses and were not fungible services generally available to the public. Again, I'm citing from the Carrozzella case, 105 F.3d at 804. In addition to these unknowing participants that testified at trial, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that there were other unknowing persons led by Maxwell. As Epstein's number one, Ms. Maxwell managed Epstein's numerous households and interviewed, hired and oversaw the household staff. The defendant had her own personal assistants, like Sarah Kellen and another individual. From the record, I can't determine the precise number of these other individuals that unknowingly assisted Epstein and the defendant in their criminal activity, but I find an adequate basis in the record that the number is sufficient to make the activity extensive within the meaning of 3B1.1(a) from 1994 to 2004. See United States v. Archer, 671 F.3d 149 (2d Cir. 2011). Last, the defendant objects to enhancement 2G1.1(b)(4)(B). That provision increases the offense level by SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
