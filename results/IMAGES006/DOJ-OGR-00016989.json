My recollection is the testimony from each of the four witnesses, I will call them, is that they said that they told Ms. Maxwell their age.\n13  Carolyn said that she told Ms. Maxwell her age. Jane said she told Ms. Maxwell her age. Similarly, Kate said she told\n14  Ms. Maxwell her age.\n15\n16     So there is no \"I'm not trying to find out what her age is\" evidence in this case.
