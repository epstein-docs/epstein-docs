How old was Ms. Roberts when she appeared and then allegedly recruited other people? That's in service of that argument. It's not in service of some other argument. And that's what that testimony went to, was, you know, we went to Mar-a-Lago, we went to these other spas, Mr. Alessi collected cards from people. I mean, that's what that testimony was. It had nothing to do with Carolyn or the others that relate to Carolyn. MR. ROHRBACH: If the issue is just, how old was Virginia Roberts when she met the defendant, there would be no need for testimony about whether the defendant also went to the Breakers to recruit massage therapists. It would just be, on what date did the encounter happen with Virginia Roberts. THE COURT: All right. I'm going to take a careful look through the transcript to see how and when and to what extent the defense, I think, reasonably -- I could reasonably interpret to put in question Ms. Maxwell's knowledge as to the age of the individuals. Am I hearing you correctly that, in the absence of this instruction, that the defense would make no argument at closing regarding specifically Ms. Maxwell's knowledge of the age of any individuals that the jury might conclude are alleged victims?
