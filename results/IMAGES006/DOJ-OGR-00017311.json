STERNHEIM: And I would ask that the Court direct\n4 the marshals to permit her to wear it throughout the day.\n5 THE COURT: I will consult with the marshals through\n6 the district executive's office. But my understanding of the\n7 new rule as of today is that entry into the courthouse requires\n8 wearing at all times, except briefly when eating or drinking, a\n9 KN95 or N95. But I'll get confirmation of that.\n10 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you very much.\n11 THE COURT: Anything else?\n12 MS. MOE: No your Honor. Thank you.\n13 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.
