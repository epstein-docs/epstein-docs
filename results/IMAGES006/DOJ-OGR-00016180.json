The exhibits that the government is going to claim corroborates, will not and will not overcome their burden. They will not overcome reasonable doubt. 5 And the stories of the individual accusers cannot be used to corroborate other accusers' stories; they are personal stories to them. The government is trying to stitch together stories of four different people, four different stories to support a pattern. The only pattern that you will see here is the success of those four people getting big money rewards from the Epstein fund. 12 Each accuser's story is thin; it lacks support. It's like taking paper cutouts and putting them together, cutouts that can't stand on their own, even linked together cannot substantiate and stand and will not support the charges here beyond a reasonable doubt. 17 I ask you to scrutinize closely all of the evidence, all of the exhibits, all of the documents, but pay particular attention to those four accusers. They have been impacted by lawyers, by media, by things they have read and things they have heard, and by money, big bucks. And I ask you again, in evaluating them and listening to them, focus on memory, manipulation, and money. Evaluate each of them for credibility, plausibility, reliability. 25 (Continued on next page) SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016180",
