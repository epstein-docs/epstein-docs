Well, so that would either be the defendant or the prosecutor, right? A. Yes. Q. Which is a party in the litigation, correct? A. Yes. Q. OK. And in a civil case, you're going to be either hired by the plaintiff or the defendant's lawyer, correct? A. Correct. Q. Now, they don't tell you to go out and just do an independent investigation on your own and then report back to them, whoever hires you. True? A. I -- I'm asked to do an independent investigation as it pertains to the specific question I'm being asked to answer in the course of my evaluation. Q. Yes, I understand that. But whoever hires you gives you material to review and then asks you a specific question based on the material that that party has given you, correct? A. Not necessarily, no. Q.
