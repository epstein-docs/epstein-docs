What if any licenses do you have? A. I'm licensed to practice psychology currently in the states of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York. Q. In your career, for approximately how many years -- THE COURT: Sorry. May I ask, Dr. Rocchio, that point you made about not taking what someone says at face value, you distinguish that as part of your forensic practice? THE WITNESS: Yes. THE COURT: And what about in your clinical practice? THE WITNESS: In my clinical practice, it's not -- I have to deal with what the patients tell me in the room. It's not my job to go out and verify any part of what's being told in the clinical room, but, rather, to hear what they're telling me and then relate that back to my other skills-training experience, the scientific literature. Someone, for example, might report to me symptoms of depression. I could ask them how that's manifesting in their life, but I don't go to their house to see if they're actually staying in bed all day. That kind of thing. THE COURT: Thank you. BY MS. POMERANTZ: Q. Dr. Rocchio, in your career, for approximately how many years have you treated and assessed patients? A. 30, maybe slightly more than 30 years at this point. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
