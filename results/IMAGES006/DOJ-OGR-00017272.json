MODE: No, your Honor. MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor. THE COURT: Two things. One, I will indicate the alternate jurors, I will tell them they will not take part in the deliberations, but they are not excused and they are under my rules until they hear from Ms. Williams. I'm going to put extra emphasis on that because we're in a pandemic and we might need a juror to return. I'll could say what I normally say, but just say this could happen. MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, are you requiring that they be here or just on call? THE COURT: I mean, I've always just done on call, but I'm happy to take a suggestion otherwise. MR.
