She said, Disclosure is a process that unfolds over time. So individuals will typically begin the disclosure maybe by alluding to what's happened in a general sense or the gist of what's happened.\nLet me pause here and say that's exactly what happened with Matt. She's alluding to what happened, giving the gist of it, but not all the details. It's just too hard.\nHere's the rest of her testimony. And then it's only over time they will begin to talk more specifically about what has happened. And even in therapy, oftentimes disclosure of the most intimate or difficult details is something that's very hard and individuals are very reluctant to do. Dr. Rocchio has explained to you that's what happens in these cases, and she's an expert in the psychology of sexual trauma.\nNow, the defense cross-examined Jane about why she didn't immediately tell someone about the abuse she suffered when she was 14 and 15 and 16, as if that would have been easy. And, in fact, when the defense points out that Jane wasn't able to tell people what really happened to her, they're actually pointing to what makes this a textbook case of child sexual abuse.\nHow else do you know that Jane told you the truth?\nIt's because her testimony is corroborated by the testimony of Annie and Carolyn and Kate, whose experiences were strikingly similar, as we've already discussed. It's not a coincidence.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00017052",
