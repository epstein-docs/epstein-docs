We are, very simply, at a vastly different place regarding the pandemic than we were only a week ago. We now face a high and daily escalating risk that jurors and/or necessary trial participants would need to quarantine, thus disrupting trial and putting at risk our ability to complete this trial. Put simply, I conclude that proceeding this way is the best chance to both give the jury as much time as they need and to avoid a mistrial as a result of the omicron variant.\nSo that is what I intend to do, and I'll tell you precisely what I intend to say. I'll hear from you.\nMR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, our only issue would be telling them to deliberate through the weekend and New Year's. I don't think it's unreasonable to have them deliberate through the remainder of the week, but given the fact that the Court told them initially that they would have those days off, I don't think we should go back on that commitment entirely. I do think that it is appropriate that they deliberate through the workweek and then have the weekend off if they so choose.\nThat's my position, your Honor.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
