MENNINGER: Your Honor, one other thing. If she did, in fact, give a statement to law enforcement in May of 2019, it hasn't been disclosed to us. 4 5 6 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. My understanding, I was at that very first meeting.

My colleague is -- again, I don't remember this off the top of my head, but -- 16 17 MS.

She declined. And I believe that may have happened around May of 2019. So she may be confusing that as the first time she ever spoke with the FBI. But she was not substantively interviewed and did not give substantive statements until September of 2019. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 THE COURT: All right. Not sealed. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
