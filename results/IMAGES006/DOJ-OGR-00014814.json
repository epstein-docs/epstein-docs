I will hear the statement from counsel for Virginia Roberts. VIRGINIA ROBERTS COUNSEL: Good afternoon, your Honor. May it please the Court, this statement I am reading on behalf of my client, Virginia Giuffre, is written to Ghislaine Maxwell. Ghislaine: 22 years ago in the summer of 2000, you spotted me at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and you made a choice: You chose to follow me and procure me for Epstein. Just hours later, you and he abused me together for the first time. Together you damaged me physically, mentally, sexually and emotionally. Together you did unthinkable things that still have a corrosive impact on me to this day. I want to be clear about one thing: Without question, Jeffrey Epstein was a terrible pedophile, but I never would have met Jeffrey Epstein if not for you. For me, and for so many others, you opened the door to hell, and then, Ghislaine, like a wolf in sheep's clothing, you used your femininity to betray us and you led us all through it. When you did that, you changed the course of our lives forever. You joked that you were like a new mother to us. As a woman, I think you understood the damage that you were causing, the price you were making us victims pay. You could have put an end to the rapes, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
