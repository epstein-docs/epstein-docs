In addition to the way I was impacted as an individual, there was the pain I experienced as a sister due to how Maria was abused by Maxwell and Epstein and the harm caused to the rest of my family due to these events. My sister Maria's abuse, the sexual assault, Maxwell's threats that stole her sense of safety and her career, the way they used her to get to me had devastating effects on her. As my family watched her grow more isolated and more physically ill from the stress of all of it, we all felt powerless. It was heartbreaking and infuriating, and we later learned how often this pattern was repeated. A young person on the path of pursuing her dreams was pulled in by Maxwell, was abused and exploited, and then had to try and piece together a life in the aftermath of this trauma that left them feeling distrustful and fearful. Most of these individuals had families who also were negatively impacted as they witnessed and felt the systemic effects of their loved one's losses and struggles. The number of people harmed is impossible to measure. Maxwell had many opportunities to come clean but instead continued to make choices that caused more harm. When my sister and I first spoke out to the media about what happened to us, Maxwell lied about us and threatened Maria, thus helping shut down investigations into their SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
