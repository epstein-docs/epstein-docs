PAGLIUCA: I apologize, your Honor. It took a while to get back here. THE COURT: I can't hear you, but that's fine. MS. MENNINGER: He was in the lockup back there. THE COURT: I see. I'll give you the note, Mr. Pagliuca. We would like to end today at 5 p.m., deliberate from 9 to 4:30 tomorrow, and have lunch at 12 noon if possible. So I'll dismiss them -- I'll bring them out to dismiss them at 5, bearing instructions in mind. I think the only open question in my mind, I have explored, given the timing, the efficiency with which trial proceeded, it is possible for them to deliberate on Thursday. MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I was going to ask you -- apologize. I have been in situations where on holidays judges have invited the jury, if they wish to come in. I think given the circumstances here, just Thursday -- THE COURT: Yes. And actually, the Court is not always closed before Christmas Eve. So when I thought we were proceeding to trial, it made sense not to sit that day, but -- and that is the jurors' expectation, so they may not be able to. But I think if they are not finished their deliberations tomorrow, I should offer that. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017287",
