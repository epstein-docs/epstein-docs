MS. POMERANTZ: Objection. THE COURT: Overruled. A. Yes, you did. Q. And please explain to the jury why that is. MS. POMERANTZ: Objection. Asked and answered, your Honor. THE COURT: I'll allow it. A. The human subjects review committees at universities and colleges are in place to try to protect human beings from being involved in experiments that might be harmful to them. And so that is why these committees will review your proposal for a piece of research and either allow you to go forward with your proposal or not allow you to go forward or suggest modifications that would allow you to go forward. But their interest is in making sure -- or trying to ensure that you're not doing something to harm the research -- that might harm the research participants. That's why we would, as I thought I indicated earlier in my testimony, would not be probably, you know, allowed to deliberately plant memories of sexual abuse. Q. On cross-examination, the government had suggested that you are a profiteer when you testify for the defense. Do you remember that? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016671",
