No, because the government didn't tell you about that. Do you know what it was after she left Jeffrey Epstein? No, because the government didn't tell you about that. Do you know her financial situation? Do you know whether she had luxury in her life? You saw photos of her that they showed you wearing tartan or hunting with dogs in the U.K., it looks from the pictures. So maybe it was Jeffrey that needed Ghislaine and her connections and not the other way around. And does that motive even make sense for a woman in her 30s, that she needs this lifestyle, so she's just willing to drag 14-year-olds in for sexual abuse? Use your common sense. And if that's the case, your Honor and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, then why wouldn't Eva Dubin be telling you the same thing? She dated Jeffrey Epstein for a decade. She saw nothing abnormal. She let her kids hang around with Jeffrey Epstein. She went on to marry a billionaire. Not one witness came in to tell you that Ghislaine Maxwell needed Jeffrey Epstein's lifestyle so bad she was willing to perpetrate on young females. I'm going to take some time now, after talking about the promises the government did not keep to you in their opening, and go through each one of these women's stories and SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
