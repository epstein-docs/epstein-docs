PAU used to be mainly an intel center made up of several different functions such as narcotics, terrorism, and RCLG. RCLG, we were more or less liaisons that would communicate with airline and airport employees in foreign countries. And we would make recommendations to those airline employees if we basically found or noticed a particular passenger that would be on one of their flights coming into the United States that might have some kind of an issue being admitted into the United States.\nWe would then, if we did find a passenger such as this, we would recommend to that airline to do what we call an offload.
