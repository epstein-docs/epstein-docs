It's clear it's a violation of New\n14 York law. This was the government's argument for not giving\n15 the limiting instructions that I gave with respect to Annie and\n16 Kate, but I did give those instructions. It sounds like maybe\n17 there was an instance in which the defense might have requested\n18 one following a particular piece of testimony. To add that\n19 now, having not -- well, let me put it this way. Having not\n20 asked for a limiting instruction then I don't think provides a\n21 basis for inclusion of limiting instructions, repetition of\n22 limiting instructions in the charge, and even without it, which\n23 was the government's original argument, it's clear that the\n24 violation of law is as charged in New York.
