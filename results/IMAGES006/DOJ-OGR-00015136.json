  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 809 Filed 08/11/25 Page 4 of 31\nfinancial hardship, substance use disorders, and prior sexual abuse. Maxwell purported to befriend the girls to gain their trust and create the illusion of friendship and responsible adult supervision, while isolating them from others. She then manipulated that trust to normalize sexual abuse by Epstein and herself, often through the pretext of giving Epstein “massages.” Maxwell personally participated in acts of sexual abuse, including, for example, instructing then-14-year-old Jane how to touch Epstein’s penis during a “massage,” and touching Jane’s breasts herself. Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in sexualized massages. Maxwell also fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s various households where sexual abuse occurred, directing employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.”\nC. Post-Trial Motions\nOn January 19, 2022, Maxwell moved for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, based on a juror’s provision of inaccurate information during jury deliberations. Dkt. 580. On April 1, 2022, after an evidentiary hearing, Judge Nathan denied that motion. Dkt. 653.\nOn February 11, 2022, Maxwell made other pretrial motions, under Rules 29 and 33. Dkt. 600. On April 29, 2022, Judge Nathan denied all but one of these motions. In the motion she granted, Judge Nathan found that the three conspiracy counts were multiplicitous, and therefore entered judgment on only one of them. Dkt. 657.\nD. Sentencing\nSentencing was held on June 28, 2022. The Government sought a sentence of at least 360 months’ imprisonment. Dkt. 670 at 53. The defense sought a sentence below the Guidelines\n4\nDOJ-OGR-00015136",
