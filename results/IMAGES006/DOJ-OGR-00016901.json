As the defense knows, one of the defense witnesses, who they ultimately decided not to call, would have testified that Epstein was living on East 71st Street prior to 1996.\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7 And so if the Court admits this -- this is the reason this has to go first in the remaining issues. If the Court admits this, the government would put on rebuttal evidence showing that, in fact, Mr. Epstein lived on 71st Street before he says he abandoned the property in 1996.\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12 So that's sort of a substantive background point.\n13 Moving through the documents, your Honor, Judge Chin's opinion is a summary judgment opinion. So I think it's quite clear actually that the facts can reasonably be disputed. The summary judgment standard, as the Court well knows, is that the Court -- is that Judge Chin had to take all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, which in this case was not the United States. So I think it very much can be controverted that the fact in -- the statement in the background section of Judge Chin's opinion is not a factual finding about when Mr. Epstein abandoned --\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23 THE COURT: Can I see it?\n24 MS. MENNINGER: What's that, your Honor?\n25 THE COURT: Can I see the document?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00016901",
