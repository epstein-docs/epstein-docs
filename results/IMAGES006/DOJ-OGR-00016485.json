I've gotten letter briefing on several issues over the past few days, including some new issues that came in last night. I did address the issue of defense witness anonymity by order last night, which will be docketed this morning when docketing puts it up, denying the defense request for anonymity for the reasons indicated.\n\nAs to the remaining issues, so there's the prior inconsistent statements issue. I received the letter with the government objections close to 11 p.m. last night. I haven't had the ability to yet go through all of them, and I haven't heard any responses from the defense.\n\nWhat's the timing of anticipated witnesses here?\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, for the witness order?\n\nTHE COURT: Well, when might we get to a witness who implicates the prior inconsistent statements? And I gather there's been some effort to work through stipulation and narrowing.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.\n\nThere have been some efforts, and I think there's going to be continued efforts there. I don't think we have a witness until after lunch that is going to implicate the prior inconsistent statements.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. That may be what we're doing during\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00016485",
