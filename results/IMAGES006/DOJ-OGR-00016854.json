You were asked some questions on direct about your contacts with Jeffrey Epstein, so I want to ask you about some time periods in particular. Focusing on the time frame from 1994 to 2004, how often did you spend time in Jeffrey Epstein's house in Palm Beach? A. Not that often. We live in New York City and we would only go to Palm Beach on vacations and occasionally long weekends. Q. And when you say \"not that often,\" can you explain for the jury what kind of frequency we're talking about? A. Very hard to say because there's so many years. But in Palm Beach specifically? Q. Yes, just focusing on Palm Beach from 1994 to 2004, how often were you in that house in Palm Beach? A. Maybe four times per year. It's hard -- I really can't remember. Q. Did you know what was going on in that house on a day-to-day basis? A. Absolutely not. Q. I'm going to ask you just a few questions about what was going on in your life during those years, focusing on the 1990s and, in particular, between 1994 and 2000. In 1994, were you living in Paris? A. Yes, we were. Q. And in 1995, your first child was born; is that right? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016854",
