That's all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and common sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact. Many facts, such as a person's state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct evidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than of direct evidence. It is a general rule that the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires that, before convicting Ms. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied of her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt from all of the evidence in the case. Instruction No. 43: Inferences. During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you've heard and will hear the term inference. For instance, if, in their closing arguments, attorneys have asked you to infer based on your reason, experience, and common sense from one or more established facts the existence of some other fact. I've instructed you on circumstantial evidence in that it involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
