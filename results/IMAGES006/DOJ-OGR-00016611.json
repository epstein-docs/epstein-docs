In terms of the stress at the time of retrieval when you're answering questions, I'm not sure, you know, to what extent that has been manipulated. I'd have to think about that a little to see if I can think of a study that might help you out there, but -- Q. Well, in addition to questioning someone, are there other situations in which there can be the exchange of information that can be suggestive to an individual? A. Yes. Q. Can you please give us some examples of that. A. Sometimes when people are trying to retrieve information, there is pressure to provide more, more details, more details about some particular subject. I've seen that not only in law enforcement interviews, but more often even in certain kinds of psychotherapy. Q. Now, talking about psychotherapy for a moment, you told the jury that you have a doctorate in psychology, but are you a practicing therapist? A. No. No. Q. Do you consult with patients in a therapeutic environment? A. I don't do therapy, but I sometimes study patients. I don't do therapy, though. Q. So you're not a psychologist who has a therapeutic practice? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016611",
