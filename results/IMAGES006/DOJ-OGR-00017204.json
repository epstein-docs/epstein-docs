In her eyes, they were just trash, beneath her. Those girls would never stand up to a power couple like Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. And if they ever did, who would believe Jane or Kate or Carolyn or Annie over them? Who would believe Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, who rubbed shoulders with presidents and celebrities and business leaders? But the defendant didn't count on those teenage girls growing up into the women who testified at this trial; women who would be willing to take that stand and tell the truth about what happened. The defendant didn't count on all four of them coming forward in an avalanche of evidence. And the defendant did not count on the witnesses -- Shawn, Matt, Dave Alessi -- who would come forward and back those women up. And she didn't count on you. She didn't count on a jury who would see past the nonsense that she tried to throw up, who would look at the evidence clear-eyed and see her for the predator that she is. Ladies and gentlemen, you know what happened here. Four incredibly brave women came forward and told you what happened to them. They opened themselves up and shared their horrifying experiences. Jane, Kate, Carolyn, Annie, they each told you how the defendant played a pivotal role in the worst events of their lives. They corroborated each other and were further corroborated by the evidence in this case. There is no SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017204",
