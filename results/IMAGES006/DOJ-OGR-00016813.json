COMEY: Your Honor, I'm transitioning entirely 3 away from where we were at the prior sidebar. I was about to 4 switch to eliciting some prior consistent statements of Jane's. 5 I do believe the door has been opened for that, but I 6 understand defense counsel would object as beyond the scope. 7 But for efficiency purposes, I was going to ask her now while 8 she's on the stand about these prior consistent statements. 9 MS. MENNINGER: I mean, your Honor, opening the door 10 to prior consistent statements in this manner will then, on 11 recross, I think open the door to any number of other prior 12 inconsistent statements that your Honor just ruled out, and we 13 had to go through an entire process to get in the very few 14 prior inconsistent statements we did.
