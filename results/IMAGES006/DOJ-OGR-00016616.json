So, for example, in the study that I've testified about already, we show people a simulated accident, so we know exactly what the event was, we know what they saw and that way we can see how the post-event information changes what they remember. Q. And in contrasting that, which you just said you could see, that would be different than somebody who just reports a memory with no visual proof or documentation of it; correct? A. Yes, then you don't have a record of what actually happened. Q. And somebody who might report a memory may give very vivid detail; correct? A. Yes. Q. And does the fact that someone reports a memory with vivid detail mean that the memory is accurate? A. No, because of false memories. Once they're constructed in somebody's mind, either by external suggestion or by autosuggestion, could be very vivid, detailed. People can be confident about them, people can be emotional about them, even though they're false. Q. So if somebody believes that they had an experience and describes that experience, there is no way of proving that that actually occurred? MS. POMERANTZ: Objection. THE COURT: Sustained.
