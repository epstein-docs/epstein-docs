STERNHEIM: Or with holes in it, at least.\n4 THE COURT: I'll show it to you there. Next to Jane,\n5 it says -- oh, I think maybe, Ms. Sternheim, you've intuited.\n6 In parentheses it says, \"Being returned,\" crossed out, and\n7 then it says, \"No.\"\n8 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, of the three testimonies they\n9 got, Jane was the last and it was Juan in a binder. The other\n10 two were in binders.\n11 THE COURT: I see. I see. I didn't know that.\n12 MS. STERNHEIM: It was in the rush of trying to get it\n13 to them quickly.\n14 THE COURT: Well, we could dispute that, but -- so I\n15 guess, because they didn't return it, I guess they are asking\n16 for another copy, three-hole punched and in a binder, in\n17 addition, Juan and Kate. My clerk will show you the note if\n18 you'd like to see it.\n19 MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor. I believe\n20 Ms. Drescher is going to print out those transcripts right now\n21 with the agreed-upon redactions and we'll hole punch them and\n22 put them in binders.\n23 THE COURT: Okay.
