With respect to the length of the sentence, the District Court properly discussed the sentencing factors when imposing the sentence, and described, at length, Maxwell's \"pivotal role in facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls through a series of deceptive tactics.\"57 The District Court recognized that the sentence \"must reflect the gravity of Ms. Maxwell's conduct, of Ms. Maxwell's offense, the pivotal role she played in facilitating the offense, and the significant and lasting harm it inflicted.\"58 And the District Court explained that \"a very serious, a very significant sentence is necessary to achieve the purposes of punishment\" under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a). In sum, the District Court did not err by failing to adequately explain its sentence. CONCLUSION To summarize, we hold as follows: 56 A-417. 57 SA-459. 58 SA-461. 25 DOJ-OGR-00014875",
