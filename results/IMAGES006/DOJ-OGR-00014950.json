  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 782 Filed 01/15/25 Page 74 of 158 74 LBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct tactics and strategies of the grooming process, that would preclude or require that those strategies be utilized for the sexual gratification of the person who's doing the grooming as opposed to a third party. And my answer to that question is no. THE COURT: OK. So you don't have an opinion on whether the presence -- let me just get the language -- the presence of a third -- of another individual can facilitate sexual abuse of minors. THE WITNESS: To the extent that we know that offenders do put themselves in situations where they're more likely to be viewed as trustworthy, surrounding themselves with individuals who a child or an intended victim might trust is going to increase the child's trust, perhaps. THE COURT: Is there any literature that you can point to that goes from that sort of broad statement about trustworthiness to the inclusion of a third individual in order to build that trust, any literature that you can point to that suggests that? THE WITNESS: The literature that just points to, more generally, perpetrators putting themselves in environments where they have a wider array of access or the grooming of institutions and other individuals for the purpose of getting greater access to the child. THE COURT: So, well, let me ask it this way. In your SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014950",
