THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of a particular study that would investigate that specific situation. THE COURT: Or any discussion of that phenomenon in the literature, specifically, not more broadly. THE WITNESS: Specifically the use of a single individual, unless you're talking about a co-offender. I mean, there is some literature, obviously, on co-offenders. There's literature that looks at, for example, in the pimping and trafficking literature, it's very common for individuals to engage in group activity. But specifically looking at child sexual abuse and the presence of a single other adult, I'm not aware of particular studies about that exact point.
