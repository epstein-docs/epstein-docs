Ms. Maxwell, I want to make sure you understand that you have the right to testify in your own defense. You also have the right not to testify. If you decide not to testify, I will instruct the jury that they may not draw any inference against you based on that decision, and that fact may not enter into their deliberations. I want to make sure that you know that the decision whether to testify or not is your decision. You are entitled to the best advice of your attorneys in making this decision, but the decision is yours. Ms. Maxwell, do you understand that?
