  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 236 of 257 3070 LCKCmax9 Charge is for you to decide to what extent, if at all, the witness's interest has affected or colored his or her testimony. You have heard the testimony of a witness who was previously convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year in jail. This prior conviction was put into evidence for you to consider in evaluating the witness's credibility. You may consider the fact that the witness who testified is a convicted felon in deciding how much of his or her testimony to accept and what weight, if any, it should be given. You're not required to accept testimony even though the testimony is not contradicted and the witness's testimony is not challenged. You may decide because of the witness's bearing or demeanor or because of the inherent improbability of the testimony or for other reasons sufficient to yourselves that the testimony is not worthy of belief. On the other hand, you may find because of a witness's bearing and demeanor and based upon your consideration of all of the other evidence in the case that the witness is truthful. Thus, there is no magic formula by which you can evaluate testimony. You bring to this courtroom all your experience and common sense. You determine for yourselves in many circumstances the reliability of statements that are made by others to you and upon which you are asked to rely and act. You may use the same tests here that you use in your everyday lives. You may consider the interest of any witness in the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017257",
