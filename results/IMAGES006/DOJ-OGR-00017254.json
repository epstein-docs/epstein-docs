An inference is not a suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\n\n2 There are times when different inferences may be drawn from different facts, whether proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. The government asks you to draw one set of inferences while the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you and you alone to decide what inferences you will draw. The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a matter of guesswork or speculation. An inference is a deduction or a conclusion that you, the jury, are permitted but not required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial evidence.\n\n3 In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense. Therefore, while you're considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw from the facts that you find to be proven such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of your experience. Some inferences, however, are impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the crime was being committed and had knowledge that it was being committed. Nor may you use evidence that I instructed you was admitted for a limited purpose for any inference beyond that limited purpose.\n\n4 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
