Obviously, if you did know the name or it was a person you recognized from before, you would put their name on the manifest? A. Absolutely. Q. And you said that it was important to keep track of the head count, which is why you wanted to know how many people were on the plane; right? A. That is correct. Q. Now, you said weight was also a consideration; is that right? A. It's a consideration on some aircraft, not the kind that we're flying, but it's something that should take into account or as far as how heavy luggage is. But it is a consideration as a pilot to know how much something weighs as far as luggage and/or passenger. Q. And that's if you're flying a small plane, for example, you need to know the weight of the passengers? A. Exactly, yes. Q. But for the planes you were flying for Epstein, particularly the Gulf Stream and the Boeing, you didn't need to know the weight for those planes; right? A. It was not necessary, no. It's, like I said, more of a head count, but yeah, it's not a factor in these type of aircraft. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017443",
