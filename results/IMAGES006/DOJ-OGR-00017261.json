It is for you to decide whether Ms. Maxwell engaged in the other conduct.\nLet me remind you that Ms. Maxwell is on trial only for committing acts alleged in the indictment. Accordingly, you may consider this evidence of similar acts as a substitute -- you may not consider this evidence -- let me start that sentence again. Accordingly, you may not consider this evidence of similar acts as a substitute for proof that Ms. Maxwell committed the crimes charged nor may you consider this evidence as proof that Ms. Maxwell has a criminal personality or bad character. The evidence of the other similar acts was admitted for a much more limited purpose and you may consider it only for that limited purpose.\nIf you determine that Ms. Maxwell committed the acts charged in the indictment and the similar acts, as well, then you may, but you need not draw an inference that in doing the acts charged in the indictment, that Ms. Maxwell acted knowingly and intentionally and not because of some mistake, accident, or other innocent reasons. You may also consider this evidence in determining whether Ms. Maxwell utilized a scheme or common plan in committing both the crimes charged in the indictment and the similar acts introduced by the government.\nEvidence of similar acts may not be considered by you\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
