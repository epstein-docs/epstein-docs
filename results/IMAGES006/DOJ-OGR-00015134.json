See generally Dkt. 670 at 3-4; Dkt. 785 at 2.\n\nOn June 29, 2020, a grand jury in this District returned a six-count indictment against Maxwell, alleging that she had facilitated and participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of multiple minor girls. It charged her with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticement of a minor to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation of a minor with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423(a) and 2; and, in two counts, perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. See Dkt. 1 (“Initial Indictment”). It based these charges on Maxwell’s conduct with respect to three minor victims, whom the Government identified pseudonymously. On July 8, 2020, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment that made ministerial corrections. Dkt. 17 (“S1 Indictment”). On March 29, 2021, a different grand jury in this District returned a second superseding indictment. It added two counts, based on a fourth minor victim, to whom it also referred pseudonymously. One charged a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; the other charged sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2.
