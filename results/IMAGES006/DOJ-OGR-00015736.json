  "full_text": "ANSWERING THE TELEPHONE\n\nHow you answer the telephone will leave a long-lasting impression on all those who call. It immediately tells the caller the service standard. When you answer the phone, the quality of your voice is of utmost importance. The person on the other end of the line cannot see your expression or gestures, so any impression that person receives depends entirely on your voice. Speak clearly and distinctly. Do not slam down the receiver at any time!\n\n- All calls should be answered in three rings or less.\n\n- If the incoming line is one of Mr Epstein's or Ms Maxwell's, answer as follows:\n\n\"Good morning / afternoon / evening. Epstein / Maxwell residence.\"\n\n- If Mr Epstein or Ms Maxwell have advised that they do not wish to receive any calls, you are to reply as follows:\n\n\"Mr Epstein / Ms Maxwell is not available. May I take a message?\"\n\nComplete a phone message slip with the following information: Name (spelt correctly), date and time of call, telephone number including the area code.\n\nPlace the message on the pantry countertop if it is for Mr Epstein, and for Ms Maxwell, on her desk.\n\n- If Mr Epstein and Ms Maxwell choose to receive a call, you are to reply as follows:\n\n\"May I ask who is calling? Just a moment please.\"\n\nRing the extension where they are located and advise them who is calling.\n\n- There is a \"Do Not Disturb\" setting on the telephone system. This option is to be set as directed in the pre-arrival check off list.\n\n- Telephone directories are to be updated every six months, or as the new telephone directories are available.\n\n- A copy of Mr Epstein and Ms Maxwell's telephone directories must be placed to the right of each telephone (except for the Guestrooms).\n\n- Always check that there are notepads and pens. These must be placed to the right of each telephone.\n\n- A pair of reading glasses must be placed in front of each telephone (except for the Guestrooms).\n\n- An extension card must be placed under the front of each telephone.\n\n2/14/2005\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-00015736",
