Ms. Espinosa, I actually want to jump back for a second. You mentioned your current job is an executive assistant for a CEO; is that right?\nA. Correct.\nQ. Can you describe generally what you do in that position.\nA. I am basically the gatekeeper for the CEO. All appointments are scheduled through me, I book a lot of travel, book a lot of meetings. I'm also, I guess, the senior executive assistant supervising about six other executive assistants for the company.\nQ. Now I will direct your attention back to October of 1996. Say again where you were living around that time.\nA. Well, I moved from California to New York, and when I first moved to New York, I lived on the Upper East Side. I previously said Midtown, but that's because I moved from the Upper East Side to Midtown during my employment.\nQ. But you started out on the Upper East Side. Okay. Did you get a job when you came to New York?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And what job did you get at that time?\nA. I was hired by J. Epstein & Co. for the legal team, legal counsel being Jeff Schantz and Darren Indyke. I was hired as the legal assistant, the legal admin.\nQ. And J Epstein & Co. was whose company?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016517",
