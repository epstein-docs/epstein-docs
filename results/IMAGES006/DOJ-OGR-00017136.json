They went to see a play, they went to the Blue Man Group, they went to the Met, they went to a New Year's party, they went to thrift stores, and she got a dress. There were two instances she met Epstein while she was in New York, and during those events, she and her sister sat had in his office across a desk and discussed her college applications. She told you she thought Epstein's home was under renovation at the time, and she told you that there was no sexual activity that occurred whatsoever in that home. She told you Ghislaine Maxwell was not in the home, never came to the home, no physical contact happened in the home, she wasn't present, she wasn't there, and she didn't see anything that had to do with Ghislaine Maxwell while she was in New York. So how did Ghislaine target her somehow to come into New York to see her sister? Where is Ghislaine Maxwell's role in any of that? The second contact she had was in the movie theater when they went to see a movie, she said she remembers was called Five Monkeys. There isn't a movie called Five Monkeys, there is a movie called 12 Monkeys, but that's what she remembers. And while she was in Five Monkeys, Epstein caressed her hand and held her hand, and as creepy as this is, what she told the Victims Compensation Fund was that him holding her hand was sexual abuse.
