While she went to New York the one time before New Mexico, Ghislaine Maxwell wasn't there, had nothing to do with it. And Kate, as we've already told you, nothing illegal happened with Kate. Counts Five and Six, the sex trafficking counts, these are the counts that relate to Carolyn. Now, the government wants you to believe that because Ghislaine Maxwell traveled to Palm Beach at some points in that period and helped to manage Epstein's properties, she was the one orchestrating massages, despite the fact that you've seen no proof of that, no message pads, no phone records, nothing. You've seen Sarah Kellen was there. The Judge is also going to explain to you that mere presence is not enough -- mere presence at the scene of the alleged crime does not, by itself, does not make someone a member of the conspiracy. And she will also, I expect, instruct you that knowledge without participation in the unlawful plan is also not sufficient to convict. In other words, you cannot conclude Ghislaine was a member of the conspiracy simply because she visited Palm Beach in the 2000s, nor can you convict her because you have some nagging sense that she must have known. She must have known is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The law presumes, as you sit here today, as I stand here today, that Ghislaine Maxwell is innocent of all the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017172",
