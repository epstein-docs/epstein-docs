  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 765 Filed 08/10/22 Page 70 of 95 LCIAMAX2ps defendant traveling with some of the minor victims. I assume the defendant is going to say that she didn't know the purposes of the trips. To the extent the purpose was sexual abuse, the government would argue that at a minimum this she did know, if she didn't she consciously avoided knowing, why Jeffrey Epstein was traveling repeatedly with these minors. THE COURT: The other point is, from the openings, I don't know if it will be a theme of the closing, but the distancing of Ms. Maxwell from Mr. Epstein and what he did was clearly a theme of the opening, and so that implicates knowledge throughout the counts. So my strong inclination is that it's appropriate here. That's my conclusion. That's my conclusion. I'm going to look back through relevant portions of testimony on the age issue, but I think even the age issue -- well, not the age issue. Knowledge of age. Specific arguments as to knowledge of age aside, knowledge of age is intertwined with arguments regarding age. And in any event, there are, as a result of the opening, questions about Ms. Maxwell's knowledge of what Mr. Epstein is alleged to have been doing that I think it's sort of a standard instance of the applicability of a conscious avoidance instruction. So my conclusion is to include it. Next. MR. VERDELL: Next, your Honor -- let me make sure. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016996",
