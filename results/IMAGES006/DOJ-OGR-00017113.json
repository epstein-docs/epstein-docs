I didn't see them.\n2 They told you you'd hear from law enforcement witnesses and they promised photographs of the search of the Palm Beach house, and that search in 2019 of the New York mansion that would show that Epstein lived in mansions filled with photographs of naked women with a massage room in each one of those houses. You didn't see a single massage room with naked women in it. I didn't. You saw a closet with photos of friends and family in Palm Beach where the massage table was stored, but there were no nude photos in the New York residence, there were no massage rooms in New Mexico. Kate said she saw a massage room in Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London, but Cim Espinosa said she was there and there was no massage room there. So law enforcement witnesses failed to deliver on that promise. And you might have also noticed the government didn't even call to the stand the two case agents in charge of this investigation. Why would that be?\n18 The government promised you evidence from these searches, a massage table, a schoolgirl outfit, and nude photographs. You saw the 20-year-old massage table sitting up here in the courtroom. What did that tell you? You didn't see a schoolgirl outfit, you didn't see all these nude photographs. You saw some artistic drawings around a rich man's house.\n24 You saw FedEx records that showed Ghislaine Maxwell didn't send any underage girl anything.
