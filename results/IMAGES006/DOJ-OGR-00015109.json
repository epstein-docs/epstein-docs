Many of these victims placed immense personal and emotional trust in the federal justice system, with the belief that the conviction of Ms. Maxwell finally represented a measure of accountability. Most view that conviction as the only justice they ever received from the criminal justice system. In that vein, we write to address the Department of Justice's request to unseal grand jury materials and to respectfully urge the Court to administer any disclosure in a manner that fully honors the victims' rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (\"CVRA\"), 18 U.S.C. ยง 3771, the enduring interests protected by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent. I. Victims' CVRA Rights Are Directly Implicated and Must Be Considered in Context-Not in a Vacuum The CVRA guarantees victims: The right to be reasonably protected from the accused (ยง 3771(a)(1));",
