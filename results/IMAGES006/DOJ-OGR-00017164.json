Not one. If all these employees are around the house all the time seeing these address books laying everywhere, where are those employees and where are all those address books? So Juan Alessi is the sole guardian who can tell you about this black address book from which the government wants to build their case. What do we know about Mr. Alessi? During his direct examination, the government asked him about his burglary of Jeffrey Epstein's home. And he turned on the stand and he looked at you in the eye and he said, I will tell the truth. And then he proceeded to not tell you the truth. He told you a story that he concocted to make himself look better. He told you that he broke into Epstein's home one time to try to help someone because he was out of money. But he told the police back in 2003 that he broke in to steal a gun. He told you he stole the money because he needed it, but then he told you he owned multiple rental properties. He told you he broke in once. But the truth was, as he told the police in 2003, he broke in twice. He went in, stole some money, and then he came back a few weeks later and stole some more money. So the man who turned and looked you in the eye SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017164",
