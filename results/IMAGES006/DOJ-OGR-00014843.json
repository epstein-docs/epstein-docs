But it is appropriate for this Court, in the face of genuine expressions of remorse and acceptance of responsibility, to decrease punishment because that's part of the message that's being sent by the law. It's appropriate to note and to take into account a lack of acceptance of responsibility, a lack of expression of remorse as to her own conduct. Today's sentence will attempt to acknowledge the harm that Ms. Maxwell caused and it will strongly and unequivocally condemn her criminal conduct. I do conclude, consistent with the Probation Department recommendation, that a sentence of 240 months, which is slightly above the guideline range that I found, is both sufficient and necessary -- and no greater than necessary to meet the purposes of punishment that I have described. I will now formally state the sentence I intend to impose. I will ask Ms. Maxwell and her counsel to please rise. Ms. Maxwell, it is the judgment of this Court that you be sentenced to a period of 240 months, 20 years, to be followed by a period of five years' supervised release. You may be seated. To be precise, I am sentencing Ms. Maxwell to 60 months on Count Three, 120 months on Count Four, and 240 months on Count Six, all to run concurrently, for a total of 240 months' imprisonment. I am sentencing her to three years of SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014843",
