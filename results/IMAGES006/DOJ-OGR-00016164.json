You have not done that. So you may\n17 not refer to that testimony that you somehow anticipate getting\n18 in, although I don't know how you will in your opening. You\n19 may not. I was very clear that before that would happen, you\n20 would have to brief it. I haven't seen any briefing, so you\n21 may not reference it.\n22 MS. STERNHEIM: But, Judge, may I just say there's no\n23 dispute that if a witness to a proffer has information that may\n24 be a conflict with the testimony here, there is no privilege to\n25 that.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
