STERNHEIM: Judge, may I just be heard?\n4 THE COURT: You need your mic on.\n5 MS. STERNHEIM: I apologize.\n6 It's like saying you could drive, but you have to\n7 abide by the speed limit. Here, it's saying you can just drive\n8 and not abide by anything when there is an instruction that\n9 limits their availability to use it in total. So I think it\n10 needs to be qualified.\n11 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, if someone asked me if I\n12 drive, the direct answer would be yes or no.\n13 MS. STERNHEIM: But if you're in an area that has a\n14 limit -- which we know is in the record, because the Court gave\n15 an instruction -- that would be part of it as well.\n16 THE COURT: All right.

STERNHEIM: We're reading into that. And if you\n21 want to ask them are they following the limiting instruction,\n22 then we would have clarity. But based upon this note, I don't\n23 think we have that precision.\n24 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the jury asked a very simple\n25 yes-or-no question. They need a very simple answer.
