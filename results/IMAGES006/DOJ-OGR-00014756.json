  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 779 Filed 08/22/22 Page 9 of 101 9 M6SQmax1 to be blind, deaf and dumb, and to say nothing of Epstein's and Ms. Maxwell's lives. Paragraph 26, there's an objection to the characterization concerning the defendant's identification and isolation of minor girls as inconsistent with the trial evidence. I overrule this objection for the same reasons as articulated with respect to paragraph 22. In addition, the trial evidence established that the defendant and Epstein isolated girls by spending time with them alone away from their families. For example, Annie's testimony regarding the trip to New Mexico. Jane's testimony that she would spend time at the Palm Beach residence alone with Epstein and the defendant. Paragraphs 27 and 28 the defendant makes two objections: First, to the assertion that the defendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a \"constant stream of girls who recruited each other.\" And, second, she objects to the assertion that she encouraged minor girls to bring other minor girls to provide Epstein with sexualized massages. Again, based on the trial testimony and evidence, I overrule the objection. It supported the information in these paragraphs. The evidence indicated the scheme started with the defendant's recruitment of Virginia. Virginia then enlisted Carolyn in addition to at least two other girls. Carolyn in turn recruited at least three friends, and those friends then brought more girls. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014756",
