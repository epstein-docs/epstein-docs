Carolyn, the\n3    government affirmatively elicited that she was told by Virginia\n4    to say that she was, you know, whatever age she was told to\n5    say. That's, I think, the government's testimony.\n6    MR. ROHRBACH: I believe that came out on cross, your\n7    Honor. It's on page 1569.\n8    MR. PAGLIUCA: If it came out on cross, it was her\n9    volunteering that information, I think.\n10   But anyway, that doesn't have anything to do with\n11   Ms. Maxwell. I mean, that's simply \"Virginia told me whatever\n12   my name -- whatever the age I'm supposed to say.\" It's not\n13   Ms. Maxwell saying to Virginia, \"Say this age.\"\n14   So I just disagree as a factual matter that this has\n15   anything to do with conscious avoidance.\n16   MR. ROHRBACH: The defense also elicited testimony\n17   that the defendant was from -- through Mr. Alessi -- that the\n18   defendant was going to legitimate hotels to identify massage\n19   therapists. I assume that that's in service of an argument\n20   that she didn't know the ages of people coming to the house as\n21   massage therapists, and so she could have confused some of them\n22   who were under the age of consent with ones who were older than\n23   the age of consent.
