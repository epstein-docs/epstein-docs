The third element says that the defendant knew that Jane was less than 17 years old. THE COURT: Do you want to do bracket? MR. EVERDELL: Yeah, I think we should do a bracket. THE COURT: Mr. Rohrbach?

THE COURT: I spent an inordinate amount of time thinking through precisely this question, and I decided that it's best just to do this because it would just be confusing. I mean, it is a separate element, but it would just be confusing. So I think this is a good suggestion. Page 25. So we'll take out -- we'll, why don't we do this.
