I guess I always feel that way a little bit when I get back from trips - but this time I am so ready to be out of high school and in college. Everything seems so silly - going out, etc. - it did a little before anyway - I even feel a little isolated from my friends. Before I left I was on a high of how great my friends were. I still realize now wonderful they are but I feel more independent; like they aren't necessary. I felt like this when I got back from Mexico and it faded quickly but I have a feeling it is different this time. New York is such an amazing city. I felt really comfortable there - like I knew that I belonged there & would live there at some point (hopefully soon). I miss it so much already it seems unfair that I can't see her more often. I feel like I'm missing so much. There is so much to tell about the trip I don't know where to begin.\nThe best night was when I saw Phantom of the Opera - We went to [REDACTED] house & had champagne w/ him. I found him down to earth & easy to talk to. I thanked him so much for the trip, etc. We then took",
