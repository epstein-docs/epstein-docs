Even the simple task of directing her to take on some of those responsibilities, which, of course, to transition parts of that role she would have to do would qualify for leadership. THE COURT: And there's clear time overlap in the role? MS. MODE: Yes, your Honor. As we noted in our brief, the flight records reflect that the defendant continued flying on Epstein's private jet at the same time that Sarah Kellen was also traveling, and that there was an overlap in the years of the time period where they were all close associates of Jeffrey Epstein and the scheme was ongoing. THE COURT: Go ahead. MR. EVERDELL: Yes. Your Honor, before I address the Sarah Kellen point, I would just make the point that the government seems to argue that there is some case law that is not clear that you don't have to necessarily show that they're supervising another criminal participant. That's just wrong. All those cases that the government cites, the issue has SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014778",
