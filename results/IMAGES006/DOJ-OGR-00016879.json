I don't know the exact number off the top of my head, but I think it is just the people who Ms. Menninger asked about on cross examination and those particular first names. So I want to make sure the record is clear, that it's not the case that the 3500 materials had hundreds of names of people -- THE COURT: Can you just give me one second. Sorry. Go ahead. MS. MOE: I just want to make sure the record was clear that in the materials relating to Jane that we produced in October, it's not the case that those materials contain hundreds of names of people. In fact, it was, I want to say, five or fewer. But Ms. Menninger has those materials and it's a very narrative scope. So I just want to make sure the record is clear on that in terms of when the relevance of that would have become apparent and how specific it was. THE COURT: And the address or contact information that you used to try to contact this witness, do you have any basis -- what is the basis to the current contact information? MS. MENNINGER: She was served personally by a process server, and with that handover, I believe she was handed the contact information to get in touch with us to be placed on call. We had a standard letter that we gave to all of the witnesses we've placed on call. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
