Q. When you spent time in the house, what, if anything, did you notice about the artwork, the statues, and the paintings? A. I thought some of it was a little creepy personally. There was, you know, like, animals and giant, like, paintings that looked kind of -- I don't know how you would -- how I would describe it, but just felt uncomfortable. Q. What made you feel uncomfortable about the paintings and the artwork in the house? A. It all sort of seemed like to have a dark theme, like it was kind of, you know, intimidating and dark and, like, animal heads and strange things. Q.
