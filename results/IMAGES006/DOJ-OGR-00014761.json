Paragraph 72, defendant objects to the assertion that Epstein briefly penetrated Carolyn's vagina with his penis because her trial testimony the defense claims is contradicted by a 2009 deposition testimony. I overrule this objection. Again, I credit Carolyn's testimony. Carolyn plainly testified to this at trial. Paragraph 74, the defendant again objects to the assertion as to the age and timing.

Paragraphs 75 and 76 the defendant objects to the inclusion of these paragraphs in the presentence report because the perjury counts have not been presented to a jury, and so she contends have no bearing on the sentence in this case.
