Finally, there are three conspiracy counts that charge Maxwell with conspiring with Epstein to commit the three crimes that we just talked about. I expect Judge Nathan will instruct you that a conspiracy just means an agreement to break the law. The crime is the agreement and taking some step to carry it out. So the question for you here is, did Maxwell agree with Epstein to commit these crimes. The conspiracy counts are counts One, Three, and Five. The first two conspiracy counts are from 1994 to 2004. Those counts are about Jane, Carolyn, and Annie. Those counts charge a conspiracy related to enticement and travel, as we've just discussed. We've already talked about how Maxwell and Epstein completed these crimes as to Jane. For the conspiracy charges, even though Carolyn and Annie were not sexually abused in New York, everything about the defendant's and Epstein's interactions with those girls makes it clear that that is what they both intended. Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as part of a broader agreement with Epstein to provide him with underage girls for abuse. You heard about all of the steps the defendant took in those years in furtherance of that conspiracy, how Maxwell traveled with Jane and groomed Annie SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
