He gave Larry Visoski 40 acres of land on a ranch free of charge so he could build a house there. He didn't ask anything in return for this generosity. Education was important to him, and he did it for a number of employees. Everyone knew that Epstein was doing this. The employees knew about the tuition payments. Everyone knew he was building a lodge at Interlochen that was handicap accessible. So to everyone, including Ghislaine, it looked like Epstein wanted to use his money to further the ambitions and education of those around him. As far as these bank records, where they showed you these big numbers, and Ms. Moe just argued that's essentially buying off a sex abuse case, you saw that for all those records, the person who signed for the accounts was Harry Beller, who Cim Espinosa told you was Epstein's accountant. He was signing all the checks. Beller had control over the account, and he's the one signing for the accounts. Who knows what that money was for.

Did they come and testify? The government wants you to speculate over and over, and they want to put up big dollar signs and make you believe SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
