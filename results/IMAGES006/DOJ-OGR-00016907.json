MS. MENNINGER: In the answer itself, Mr. Epstein says, You asked me that question three times. And the question was, Is it correct that you moved from the premises to 9 East 71st in or around the beginning of 1996? That's the exact question -- THE COURT: What was the response? MS. MENNINGER: You asked me that question three times. I believe it is around then, but I don't know exactly when. And the position of Jane was that he was living there in 1994. So I think under 401, it is a question of whether that's relevant. It is certainly different than the testimony -- THE COURT: The fact that it was asked three times is the argument that it -- contrary to my immediately prior ruling, that there was a motive to develop it? MS. MENNINGER: There was motive to develop it, your Honor. That was the whole point of this litigation. I mean, I can offer the complaint as well, but it's in the summary judgment ruling. THE COURT: Okay. For the same reason, it's sustained. What else? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016907",
