They were no longer finding girls through the cover of scholarships and opportunity. Instead, they devised a pyramid scheme of abuse, a scheme that no longer required the defendant to personally find young girls for Epstein.\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16 So what did the defendant and Epstein do? They encouraged girls to bring other girls. They asked the girls if they had any young friends to bring over. And when a girl brought someone new, she was rewarded with cash, extra cash on top of the hundreds of dollars she got for giving Epstein a sexualized massage. The defendant and Epstein handed hundred dollar bills to poor teenage girls in exchange for them giving Epstein so called massages. To be clear, those girls were not professional masseuses - they were kids being sexually exploited and abused.\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016146",
