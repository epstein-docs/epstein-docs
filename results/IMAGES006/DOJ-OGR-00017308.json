THE COURT: I think it was -- it was the one I was talking about with the issue of causation, but I believe that case also tried to define the words separate and apart from the causation issue. MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government would have no objection to the Court providing the instructions set forth in Almonte and Dupigny. THE COURT: That's the model I have. Those charges, I believe, also provided the language that we did include, which is what the parties agreed on, which is that these words have their ordinary meaning. So on the table derived from Almonte and Dupigny is: \"Entice\" means to attract, induce, or lure using hope or desire. I think we would also reference them back to the line that you indicated, Ms. Moe. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: Just a moment. MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I'm sorry. THE COURT: Take your time. MR. EVERDELL: Because I don't have internet access, so I can't pull it up on my computer. THE COURT: Broxmeyer, which is 616 F.3d 120, defined \"entice\" as \"to draw on by exciting hope or desire; allure.\" SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
