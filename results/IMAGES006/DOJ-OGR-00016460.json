The defendant -- Jane's testimony, in combination with Dr. Rocchio's testimony, would lead the jury to concludes that the defendant was in a relationship of coercive control with Jane, which would have allowed her to exercise control to get Jane to continue to travel to New York where, Jane's testimony is, the defendant personally engaged in sexual abuse of Jane. So those are plenty of reasons why the enticement statute is met as to Jane herself, in light of the course of conduct the defendant engaged in with Jane over many years.\nBut even if the Court didn't readily conclude that that statute was met, the defendant is also charged under an aiding and abetting theory. And there can be no serious argument that Jeffrey Epstein didn't entice, persuade, induce, and coerce Jane to travel to New York. And given that fact, it's quite obvious that the defendant was aware of that plan, given that she was on the plane and in the room in New York when the abuse was happening. And she took steps over multiple years to knowingly associate herself with it and to facilitate it. So that, again, is a separate theory by which the statute is met.\nAnd finally, here, I would just remind your Honor, as I'm sure your Honor is already aware, the standard here is remarkably low. All that is required is that taking all SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016460",
