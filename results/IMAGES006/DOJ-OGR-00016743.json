She didn't have documents in front of her.\n2\n3 She was being inquired in 2019 about when she lived someplace in the early '90s, and she made a '92 comment, '93, according to the portion that was provided to us.\n4\n5\n6 THE COURT: You'll provide the transcript.\n7\n8 MS. COMEY: We already have, your Honor. We produced the entire transcript as discovery last week when we realized that this might be relevant.\n9\n10 MR. EVERDELL: Given we got there last week, we are trying now to address this issue with a witness that has relevant testimony to the very issue.\n11\n12\n13 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would note this is a public document that is available on a New York State public website.\n14\n15 THE COURT: I have a rule: You have your next witness or you rest. On this issue, simply because I raised a question and the government has a response, we're not delaying trial.\n16 So we'll see where we are, but if otherwise the case closes today, it closes today. I'm not delaying trial on this issue because I let in what you sought to have let in.\n17\n18\n19 MR. EVERDELL: I think, your Honor, that on the issue of whether we're going to rest today, we still have the issue of whether the marshal is going to be able to produce one of the witnesses that we want that we put on the valid subpoena.\n20\n21 So we're going to be going over to Monday probably anyway.
