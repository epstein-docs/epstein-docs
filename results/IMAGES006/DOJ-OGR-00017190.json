They mixed up details, couldn't remember exactly when certain things took place. But if you think about your own lives and your own memories, you will see that difficulty remembering certain things doesn't mean that they didn't happen, doesn't mean that you don't remember the core. Jane and Carolyn were both abused many, many times over a period of years. The abuse became routine, the same sickening process each time, these were recurring events. Now imagine you were asked to recall a recurring event from years ago in your own lives. Say something like a holiday, like Thanksgiving. There is a routine you follow each year, the same food, the same people attend. That event stands out in your mind because it's significant, it's a holiday, but you won't necessarily remember the specific dinner conversation you had each year. You're sure you had turkey because that happened every time, but some details are just not going to stand out to you because essentially the same thing happens every year. Now what might stand out is when a routine gets broken. Say one year a neighbor came over to join who was unexpected or you switched up salt and sugar and a pie got totally ruined. You'll remember that different thing, but you might not be able to remember which Thanksgiving that thing happened. Did the neighbor come when I was 14, or 15, or 16?
