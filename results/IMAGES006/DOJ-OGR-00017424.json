Mr. Visoski, in all these flights that you flew, the several hundred to a thousand flights that you piloted for Mr. Epstein in this time period, you also never saw any kind of sexual activity occur on the planes; isn't that right?\nA. I never saw any sexual activity, no.\nQ. And you certainly never saw anyone engaging in sex acts with underage girls on the plane?\nA. Absolutely not.\nQ. In fact, you never saw anyone engaging in sex acts with any of the women on the flights period; right?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. Now, you testified, I think we already established this, that when you were flying, in flight, the cockpit doors were closed?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. So if the cockpit doors were closed, you couldn't necessarily see what was going on in the cabin during the flights; right?\nA. Not at all, no.\nQ. But you were never instructed by Epstein or anyone else that you were not allowed to leave the cockpits during the flights; is that correct?\nA.
