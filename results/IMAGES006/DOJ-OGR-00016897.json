COMEY: Yes, your Honor. We appreciate the Court's indulgence. We've reached a number of stipulations, and I believe we'll be able to finish the case this afternoon as a result. So we very much appreciate the Court's patience with the parties.\nThere is one issue that I believe the defense still wanted to raise that we were not able to reach agreement on. I would propose that we have that argument now and then, depending on the result of that, I think we can proceed to wrap the case up.\nTHE COURT: Okay. All right.\nHow long will the reading of stips take?\nMS. COMEY: Ten to 15 minutes, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Oh, okay. So I didn't know if we were talking an hour, in which case my suggestion was going to be let's do that and then give the jury a break and then finish, but okay.
