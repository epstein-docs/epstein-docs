You know that Jane traveled with Maxwell and Epstein because Jane told you that. But you also know it because Alessi told you about that. And you know it because the flight records show it too. So let's take a look at Government Exhibit 662. So in the flight records, you learned that the pilots didn't always see the passengers or learn their names; sometimes they just wrote one female or one passenger. Here's an example from January of 1995. And, of course, you know that Maxwell and Epstein wouldn't have been eager to have a pilot log the name of the kid they were bringing on trips. They wouldn't be eager to introduce her to the pilots until she got older. But Jane is listed on several flights in these records. Here's the first one where her name appears. It's November 1996, when Jane was just 16 years old. Here she is on a flight from Palm Beach to Teterboro Airport. That's the airport they would use when they were flying to New York. What you're looking at is cold, hard proof that Jane was an underage girl being transported to New York. And while Maxwell isn't listed on the flight log for the flight there, you know she was there because you look -- if you look at the second entry right below that, she's on the flight log leaving New York the very next flight. That's how you know that Maxwell was in New York too. She's right there. Here's the next flight where Jane's name appears. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017048",
