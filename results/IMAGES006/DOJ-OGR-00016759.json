MENNINGER: Said she didn't know about it because\n4 it was her lawyer who had had the communication.\n5 MS. COMEY: My recollection, your Honor, is that we\n6 had this discussion on the record and that Jane testified that\n7 she was told at some point about The Lion King coming out in\n8 1997, and I think defense counsel elicited from her that that\n9 was -- that it was after that, that she had a different memory\n10 about her travel to New York. So I think the record is\n11 available for defense to make the argument it wants to make.\n12 MS. MENNINGER: I think, as your Honor heard from\n13 Dr. Loftus yesterday, the fact that someone suggests an answer\n14 and that may be the part that wasn't clear from Jane's\n15 testimony, because it came through her attorney,\n16 Mr. Rossmiller, but I'll go back and take a look at your\n17 Honor's ruling and raise any issues with the government in\n18 conferral.\n19 THE COURT: Okay. I will cross whatever bridge you\n20 put in front of me. I'm looking at my ruling on the three\n21 attorneys, which kept out that testimony.\n22 What else? We do have all our jurors.\n23 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I anticipate that one of\n24 the witnesses this morning, the defense will call Special Agent\n25 Amanda Young, who is one of the case agents on the\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
