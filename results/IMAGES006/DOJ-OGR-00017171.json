MENNINGER: And Count Six only relates to Carolyn. 2 So if you don't believe Carolyn or if you have a reasonable 3 doubt about Carolyn adding Ghislaine to the story, you just 4 acquit her on that charge, as well. 5 And there are numerous reasons why you should have 6 substantial reasonable doubt in this case. 7 But before I get to that, let's talk about conspiracy. 8 Judge Nathan will explain to you that conspiracy is an 9 agreement to accomplish something unlawful, and the 10 government's theory is that Epstein and Maxwell agreed that 11 they would encourage or arrange for females under the age of 17 12 to travel to New York to engage in sex acts with Epstein, and 13 New York law provides that an adult of someone under 17 cannot 14 legally consent to have sexual contact. 15 So, what did Annie Farmer and Kate and Carolyn have to 16 do with that violation of New York law? Nothing. Carolyn 17 never went to New York. She never traveled anywhere. Any 18 suggestion that she was asked to travel was something she added 19 in the last year after her first lawsuits were over and her 20 money was gone and she was adding Ghislaine Maxwell to the 21 case. 22 Annie came to New York through no involvement of 23 Ghislaine Maxwell. As she told you, quite clearly on the stand 24 and after she went to New Mexico, nobody asked her to travel 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017171",
