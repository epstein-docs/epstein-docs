Now let's talk about Count Four, it's transportation of an individual under age 17 to engage in illegal sexual activity. And again, this count is about Jane. The first element is that the defendant knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce. Here we're talking about the travel itself. The last count we looked at was about enticement to travel, this one is about the travel itself. We've already talked about how Jane was transported to New York, and for this count, all that's required is that the defendant was actively engaged, either personally or through an agent, in making travel arrangements, or that she aided and abetted Epstein. THE COURT: Ms. Moe, closer to the mic, please. MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. Maxwell did not need to physically transport Jane herself or even be present for transportation, but again, Jane told you that Maxwell helped with her travel arrangements and that Maxwell was on flights with Jane. Juan Alessi confirmed that. The flight records confirm that. The second element here is that the defendant transported Jane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law. We've already talked about this one and how the evidence conclusively proves that SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017079",
