MS. MENNINGER: May I inquire, your Honor? In some courtrooms I've been in there is a rule, perhaps not strongly enforced, but strongly suggested, that the government only reserve a certain portion of their summation for the rebuttal piece because otherwise it ends up being a bit of a more in rebuttal than in the actual substance. I don't know if your Honor has that practice, but I would request that some reasonable percentage be allocated to the first versus the rebuttal portion. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I expect the rebuttal will be significantly shorter than the closing. I don't think that's going to be an issue. THE COURT: Well, it certainly should be. It should be rebuttal and not -- MS. COMEY: That's exactly right, your Honor. And I'll be doing the rebuttal. I fully intend it to be much shorter than the closing and to the point, as is consistent with our office practice before your Honor and in this district. THE COURT: Okay. Anything else on that? Let me just check my various inputs to see if I'm missing -- check with my law clerk. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016727",
