So I think it's -- to make the same point. But if we're going to lose his testimony, because I think it's relevant testimony, I would like to get in all parts of his testimony that I think are relevant to this issue of ownership. MR. ROHRBACH: We're happy to confer with defense counsel and try to work something out. I would just note that defense counsel has not produced any records to the government showing this prior ownership of Stanhope Mews. THE COURT: All right. MR.
