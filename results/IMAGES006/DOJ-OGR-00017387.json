And while that's up, Mr. Visoski, would you please describe\n3 what the inside of this apartment looked like.\n4 A. I believe it was on the second or third floor, we're going\n5 back a little ways. But it was -- once you went in the front\n6 door, it was a little on the unique side. It was a very long\n7 type of apartment. Once you went in the front door, there was\n8 an entrance foyer. And if you continued straight through that\n9 foyer, it would take you into the kitchen. And then to the\n10 left of the kitchen, I think, led down to a hallway with some\n11 guest bedrooms.\n12 Once you came back to the kitchen, to the right there\n13 was a dining room. And then to the right of the dining room\n14 there was Mr. Epstein's office where he had a home theater set\n15 up in his office as well. And then once you came out back into\n16 the foyer, I believe if you went to the right, it took you to\n17 either more guest bedrooms, and definitely the master bedroom\n18 was down the hallway.\n19 Q. When Mr. Epstein stayed at this apartment, what airport did\n20 you fly out of?\n21 A. We flew into Paris-LeBourget.\n22 Q. Turning now to Mr. Epstein's island, about when did you\n23 first visit that island?\n24 A. It was approximately mid to late -- late '90s.\n25 Q.
