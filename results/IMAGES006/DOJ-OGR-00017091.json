And that's because those experiments are nothing like what happened here. And Loftus was basically forced to admit that on cross-examination.\nRemember that study she described about telling people that they were lost in a mall? Remember that she only was able to trick 25 percent of the participants about that.\nBut, more importantly, another researcher then did a follow-up study, and that researcher tried to implant two false memories. She tried to implant the lost-in-the-mall story, and also a story about an unpleasant bodily intrusion, a rectal enema. Now, some people were tricked about getting lost in the mall, but no one had a false memory about getting a rectal enema. Why is that? Your common sense tells you that kind of experience is the sort of thing you can't trick someone into believing. You cannot suggest that. You can't make it up. A rectal enema is the kind of thing you'd only remember if it really happened, kind of like sexual abuse.\nAnd again, Loftus basically had to admit this on cross-examination. She said the core memory of trauma is stronger than other types of memory. She admitted that. People might forget some of the peripheral details, but the core of the traumatic event, those memories are much stronger.\nYou don't need a paid expert to tell you that, ladies and gentlemen. It's just common sense. You remember something like this.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00017091",
