EVERDELL: So why don't we say \"under the age of 18,\" if we could, your Honor.\n2 THE COURT: Is that okay, Mr. Rohrbach?\n3 MR. ROHRBACH: Since it relates to multiple individuals here, it would have to be \"individuals under the age of 18,\" but the government would be fine with that change to avoid ambiguity.\n4 THE COURT: Okay. So page 15, line 23, it will read \"to engage in sex trafficking of individuals under the age of 18.\" Just one moment.\n5 MR. EVERDELL: And your Honor, next page, it's a similar request. On line 1, we would say, \"Count Six of the indictment charges the defendant with sex trafficking of individuals under the age of 18.\"\n6 THE COURT: Okay.\n7 MR. ROHRBACH: Well, your Honor, for this one, since it just relates to Carolyn, it could just be an individual, but otherwise that's fine.\n8 MR. EVERDELL: An individual under the age of 18.\n9 THE COURT: That's right. All right. So we'll change page 16, line 1 to read, \"Count Six of the indictment charges the defendant with sex trafficking of an individual under the age of 18.\"\n10 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.\n11 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016943",
