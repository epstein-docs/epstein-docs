Epstein, 19-cr-490 (RMB) and U.S. v. Maxwell, 20-cr-330 (PAE) Dear Judges Berman and Engelmayer, We write on behalf of Annie Farmer in response to the belated notice that we received from the Department of Justice on July 25, 2025, advising that the Court is seeking letters on behalf of victims setting out their positions on the proposed disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein's and Ghislaine Maxwell's grand jury transcripts.1 By the Government's admission, \"over one thousand victims\" suffered from Epstein's and Maxwell's actions. To date, however, the combined forces of our country's law enforcement agencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes committed against countless young women and girls, and the Government's recent suggestion that no further criminal investigations are forthcoming is a cowardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.2 1 Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes and testified at Maxwell's trial. While the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein and Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice's notice did not identify the specific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure. 2 Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is now, to the victims' horror, herself attempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon BOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP 401 East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 1200, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301 | (t) 954 356 0011 | (f) 954 356 0022 | www.bsllp.com DOJ-OGR-00015103",
