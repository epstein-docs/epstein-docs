Things were really tough at home. She had big dreams of working in the arts one day. She was talented. When Annie was 16, she lived with her mother who was supporting her daughters by herself on a limited income. Annie was hoping to go to a good college. When Kate was 17, she lived with her mother who had been sick. Things were difficult at home and Kate was alone a lot. And she was dazzled by this impressive woman who made her feel special. When Carolyn was 14, she lived with her mom, a single mom who was an alcoholic. She had previously been sexually abused by family members and she told Maxwell about that. Make no mistake. Selecting these girls was predatory behavior. Maxwell and Epstein picked vulnerable girls. They found kids who needed something. They were exploiting that need. So what was the next stage of the playbook? It was isolating the girls. Maxwell and Epstein got them alone in Epstein's enormous houses, alone on trips to Epstein's sprawling ranch, his mansion on the Upper East Side. They got them alone in massage rooms. They were away from their parents. Remember how Jane told you that her mother was never invited when she would spend time with Maxwell and Epstein? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
