She had no trouble articulating her claims. She had a lawyer, she filed a lawsuit, a lawsuit that didn't mention, in 290 paragraphs, Ghislaine Maxwell one time.\n\nThe same is true with Jane. She told stories about Epstein. Initially, she said she wasn't sure that Maxwell was ever in the room. And don't be fooled about this difficulty in disclosing the details of it. She had two male lawyers. She had no difficulty disclosing it to them before she ever met with the government. And when she walked in to talk to the government, she told them she wasn't sure if Maxwell was ever in the room. But her lawyer told her it would help her with her case if she cooperated with this prosecution, and so she did, and the lawyers kept asking, the FBI kept asking, are you sure that maybe the person who had a foreign accent was perhaps Ghislaine Maxwell? Are you sure maybe he groped your breasts instead of massaging your upper chest? Are you sure there wasn't sexual abuse in New Mexico? Perhaps you met him when you were only 14? Perhaps you didn't just meet Epstein then,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00017106",
