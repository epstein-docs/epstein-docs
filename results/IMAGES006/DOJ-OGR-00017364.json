COMEY: Nothing from the government, your Honor.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Nothing, your Honor, but note we have put the folders under the chairs as we agreed yesterday.\n\nTHE COURT: And the government has seen -- well, I guess you didn't see them, but you are aware of them?\n\nMS. COMEY: We have seen the outside of the folders, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: Mr. Everdell, there are two folders.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: There is one folder with two documents.\n\nTHE COURT: One folder with two documents. And then, as we discussed, he'll direct us as necessary to make sure everybody can follow along.\n\nI think the only thing I wanted to raise is that, assuming the timing works out, I would like to speak with the juror who had the trip planned, with the court reporter present, of course, to see if there is additional information about the ability to change that plan to make sure it's not weighing on my mind.
