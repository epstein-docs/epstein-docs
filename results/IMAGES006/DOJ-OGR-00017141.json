That's just the way it is. So if we had her journals, we might know, but we don't. So then if you look a year later, in April of 1997, there is a trip where Jeffrey and Ghislaine go about that time of year together to New Mexico in March or April of 1997. Annie Farmer is 17, almost 18 years old. And there is a flight log that shows them going at that time. So maybe she just got it wrong by a year, meaning she's 17 when she went there. She also says that trip to New Mexico happened right before she went to Thailand. So naturally, one would look at her border patrol records and figure out when did she go to Thailand, because that would help us figure out when she actually went. So when you look at those records, it shows her very first trip out of the country and coming back into the country was in July of '97, not in '96, when she was 18. And you see she's coming back through a city called Düsseldorf in Germany, which is not Thailand, I understand that. But then you remember I asked her mom, Weren't you in Germany when she was in Thailand? And she said, Yes, I was. So Annie flies back from Thailand to Germany, where her mother is, and then they fly back together when she's a senior, not a junior, in 1997, and not 1996. That's what the documents show. And don't let the government tell you these records -- I mean, the government is going to tell you that their own SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017141",
