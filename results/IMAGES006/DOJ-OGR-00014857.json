  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 178 Filed 06/27/22 Page 25 of 26 prospective jurors completed a lengthy questionnaire, with several questions raising issues relevant to the trial. Based on the completed questionnaires, the parties selected prospective jurors to proceed to in-person voir dire. The District Court ultimately empaneled a jury. During the four-and-a-half-week jury trial, the Government presented evidence of the repeated sexual abuse of six girls. At the conclusion of trial, on December 29, 2021, the jury found Maxwell guilty on all but one count.6 Following the verdict, Juror 50 gave press interviews during which he stated that he was a survivor of child sexual abuse.7 In his answers to the written jury questionnaire, however, Juror 50 answered \"no\" to three questions asking whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the victim of a crime; whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault; and whether he or a friend or family member had ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Six charged Maxwell with sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. Counts Seven and Eight charged Maxwell with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The perjury charges were severed from the remaining charges and ultimately dismissed at sentencing. 6 The jury found Maxwell guilty on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six. Maxwell was acquitted on Count Two. 7 Consistent with a juror anonymity order entered for trial, the parties and the District Court referred to the jurors by pseudonym. 7 DOJ-OGR-00014857",
