Interlochen has not provided any goods or services to you in exchange for your gift). But, it is difficult to adequately express our deep sense of appreciation for all that you have done in furthering the mission of Interlochen over the past four years. In addition to your personal and significant annual contributions, you have opened up and hosted several alumni meetings and receptions (our New York alumni group is now one of the strongest in the nation). It all began with our first meeting at the Villard House. Dr. Tuckerman's recent endowed gift in your honor speaks to your support and commitment to Interlochen.\nLast year we built the Epstein Lodge, Interlochen's first scholarship lodge in many years. It is our premier guest accommodation and the first handicapped accessible facility. Most recently you gave your strong endorsement of Interlochen to the Ciralsky family as they investigated the Academy offerings for their daughter, Jessica.\nYou have done much in the name of Interlochen. We thank you. If I might borrow from my colleague Dr. Luby, you are a mensch!\nBest wishes for a successful 1995.\nSincerely,\nTimothy J. Ambrose\nVice President\nInstitutional Advancement\nInterlochen Arts Academy Interlochen Arts Camp Interlochen Public Radio 88.7 FM/100.9 FM\nAddress: Interlochen Center for the Arts P.O.
