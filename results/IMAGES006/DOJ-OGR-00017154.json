And he claimed to remember some of what he thought was a French accent. And in that meeting, he identified Sarah and then another European with an accent that wasn't British that you couldn't identify; correct? Correct. He met with the government five times. And in a fifth meeting, he said he couldn't identify the accent. The truth of the matter is Shawn never talked to Ghislaine Maxwell and never heard her voice. I want to turn to the other witnesses that came and testified here. The government talked to you about Dr. Rocchio, the ultimate victim apologist who tried to explain away why these accusers continued to have contact, including traveling with Epstein or offering to send photos to him in jail 30 years later. And to Dr. Rocchio, that's just proof that they are victims. She's not trained as a treating therapist to question accusers' accounts. She's not a lawyer or a judge or a juror. She's a treating therapist. The government has spent a lot of time and money on Dr. Rocchio talking to you about grooming. There was no evidence that Ghislaine Maxwell groomed anyone. Carolyn was recruited by someone else. Annie met Ghislaine Maxwell one time in her life. Kate was a sophisticated adult above the age SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
