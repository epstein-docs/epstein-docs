You made a right turn, brought you into the passenger compartment. And as soon as you got into the passenger compartment, there were four large captain's chairs. They were baseball glove leather in color. This aircraft had a burgundy carpet. Once you get past the four chairs, you're continuing walking to the rear of the aircraft. There was a conference table to the right that had two chairs as well. And then further aft, as you continue walking to the back of the aircraft, there was a couch or a divan inside there. And then once you went past the couch divan, there was a galley or what you would call kitchen inside the aircraft. And as you went further past that was the bathroom for the aircraft. And then further back than that is the luggage compartment. Q. What, if any, barrier was there on this aircraft between the pilots and the passengers? A. Between the pilots and the passengers there was a door that could be shut. Q. And when you flew this plane for Mr. Epstein, was that door open or shut during flight? A. We always had the door closed. It's much quieter with the door closed as well. Q. So were you able to observe what the passengers were doing when you flew this plane? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
