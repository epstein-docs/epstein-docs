Do you recall being asked questions about your daughters on cross-examination, Mr. Visoski? 2 A. Yes, I do. 3 Q. When your daughters were 14 years old, did you let them give Mr. Epstein a massage? 4 A. No, I didn't. 5 Q. Do you recall being asked about Jane and another person who has the same first name as Jane? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. Who did you meet first, Jane or the person who is identified in Defense Exhibits LV3A and LV3B? 8 A.
