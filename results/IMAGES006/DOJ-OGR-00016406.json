MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I'm not sure what the witness is being shown the document for. THE COURT: I'll allow it. I will see, but I presume prior consistent statements following impeachment of prior inconsistent statements. MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. But either the witness recalls it from memory or needs to be refreshed, and that's the part that's not a matter of record in this procedure. THE COURT: Fair enough. You'll ask the specific question and then we can take it from there. You can take it down. BY MS. POMERANTZ: Q. Annie, do you recall what you told the FBI in 2006 about the massage that Maxwell had given you? A. I recall the parts that I've described. Q. Can you explain? A. Yes.
