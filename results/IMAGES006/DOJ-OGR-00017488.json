Mr. Visoski, I have one related question about the home theater equipment you installed. You testified that you installed this type of equipment in virtually all of Epstein's residences; right? A. Yes. Q. And you installed it in his residence in Palm Beach, you said; right? A. Yes. Q. So that Palm Beach residence was 358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach? A. That's correct. Q. Do you recall a time when the El Brillo Way residence was being renovated and Epstein had to move to a rental residence in Palm Beach? A. I do remember that time. Q. And did you install the sort of home theater or any audio equipment in the rental residence? A. I don't recall installing in the rental residence, no. Q. Do you recall where the rental residence was located in Palm Beach? A. I don't know the address. I know approximately where it was, but I don't remember the address. Q. Do you recall when the renovation took place? A. I do not. I'd only be guessing if I said the mid 1990s, but I can't give you an accurate date. Nothing sticks out in SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017488",
