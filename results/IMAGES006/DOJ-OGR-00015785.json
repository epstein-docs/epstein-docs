During this time, you are to make yourself available for any duties that need to be carried out, or respond to an emergency that may arise.\n\nIn order for you to be able to respond promptly, you should not travel more than one hour from your home base. This means that if you are called, the maximum time it will take you to return, is one hour.\n\nTo properly perform this duty, you should know the following:\n\n- You could be called upon at any time, day or night.\n- Have the necessary contact details for Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell, the Estate Manager and other relevant staff members.\n- Call the Estate Manager and other relevant staff members and advise them of an emergency. This should be done immediately.\n- When speaking to the Estate Manager or other relevant staff members, provide accurate and detailed information.\n- The security of the house, Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests are your first consideration. Always handle a crisis in a calm and professional manner.\n\n2/14/2005\n56\nDOJ-OGR-00015785",
