I didn't understand until this moment that that was the same person who you've raised this morning as a witness regarding Ms. Maxwell -- the timing of Ms. Maxwell's residence at the Kinnerton address. MR. EVERDELL: Yes. And I'm sorry I wasn't clear about that, your Honor. I think there has been a lot going on, but I apologize about that. That was who I was referring to there because the other person who we had put the name on the witness list who is from the U.K., we had decided not to call that person before yesterday. It was this one that I was referring to. And I can even give the name now so we're not talking about an anonymous person. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. As I stand here, I still don't know who this person's name was and it hasn't been produced and the defense is out of witnesses. I think this is the definition of a delayed disclosure. We're at the conclusion of the defense's case and I'm learning for the first time the name of this witness. I still haven't received their 26.2 material. And it's clear the defense has been on notice of -- MR. EVERDELL: It's not true at all. We did not know about this witness until yesterday. His name is Kevin Moran, and he is the owner of the Nags Head Pub across the street from 44 Kinnerton Street. We did not know about him until very, very recently. I'll have to get the exact time.
