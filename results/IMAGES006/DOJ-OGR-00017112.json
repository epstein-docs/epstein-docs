He remembered her striking eyes. He said she was fully mature when he met her. And by the way, does it make any sense to you that if Epstein is showing off Jane, he keeps her undercover when she's 14 and 15 to put her on a flight log as a female and all of a sudden, when she's 16, takes her up to introduce her to the pilot? Does that make any sense based on the evidence that you heard? No. No pilot came and told you they saw Carolyn on a plane or Kate or Annie. And no flight logs show any of those three women either. What about the multiple promised Palm Beach employees who would tell you about this culture of silence? They bombed on this promise, too. There was no culture of silence. You just got the sound of silence, ladies and gentlemen. You heard from one employee from the Palm Beach house. You know there were many, there were chefs, there were landscapers, there were gardeners, there were assistants, assistants to assistants, and you got a two-time burglar, obviously with an ax to grind because you know he wasn't getting along with the boss. He had a deeply flawed memory, Juan Alessi did. He couldn't remember whether dates happened in '94 or 2000. He couldn't remember the number of times he robbed a house. He couldn't remember the ages of girls, whether they were 20 or 14. Where are all these Palm Beach employees who are going to tell you about a SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
