We'll break for five. (Recess) THE COURT: Yes. MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, with the benefit of the break, the government has honed its request and basis for it. So, as Ms. Moe said, we think there was several assertions which were not in the record, but the clearest one perhaps is Ms. Menninger's arguments about the way interviews were conducted in this case. The Court will recall we had extended discussion about that when Special Agent Young was on the stand on Friday, Ms. Comey asked a question and the Court said that if Ms. Comey, in fact, asked the question and got the answer, it opened the door to evidence about how the interviews were conducted. THE COURT: It was referencing the cross examination of the witnesses themselves regarding how they were questioned in the interviews and the prior interviews. That was the evidentiary basis for those comments. Overruled. Anything else? MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing else from the government, your SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017181",
