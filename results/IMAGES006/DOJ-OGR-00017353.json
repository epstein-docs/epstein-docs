I think I should mention 1/2 as well, since that's the Sunday, \"until you reach a verdict.\" 2 Go ahead, Ms. Sternheim. 3 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you, Judge. 4 I would just say, with regard to those holiday dates, 5 that it should be their option. This jury knows that they were 6 committed through January 15th. If for some reason they have 7 plans that are going to distract them by virtue of having to 8 cancel them, I think the option is they can if they wish, but 9 it can be continued on Monday if that is their preference. 10 11 THE COURT: Well, I will say, again, if anyone has any 12 unmoveable commitments or -- what have I said? If that is a 13 hardship or anyone has any unmoveable commitments, they can let 14 Ms. Williams know, but for the reasons I have indicated on the 15 record, I am going to set this schedule, regarding my concern 16 that, given the high likelihood that a necessary member of the 17 trial participants or one or more members of the jury would 18 need to quarantine for ten days should they test positive, that 19 is a substantial delay and only increasing the risk over 20 time, and so I am, for the reasons I've indicated, greatly 21 concerned, and therefore it's my view that we need to proceed 22 every day on our schedule unless -- and they are not shy to 23 indicate -- unless they indicate it's a hardship, okay? 24 MS. STERNHEIM: You know what our preference is, but 25 of course we'll abide by your decision.  SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017353",
