The first visit for Carolyn to this house was the beginning of years of sexual abuse. Carolyn told you about how Maxwell would call her to set up appointment times for these so-called massages, and sometimes Sarah Kellen would call, too. Here's her testimony about that. She told you that Maxwell would call and set up appointment times. She said for the first year or two, Maxwell would call, and then Sarah would call after that point. And you know that's true because Carolyn said that twice when she gave deposition testimony under oath in 2009. Here's the first one. This is Carolyn's deposition testimony from 2009. \"Q. In fact, Mr. Epstein himself did not contact you on each occasion and request you to come, did he? \"A. No. He would have Sarah or Maxwell call me.\" Here's the second one. \"Q. And on these occasions that you called to see if you could go over there and give him a massage, did you talk to him or did you talk to others at his house? \"A. I talked to Sarah or Maxwell. I've also talked to -- I don't know if it's a cook or someone else that was there that took phone messages.\" SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017064",
