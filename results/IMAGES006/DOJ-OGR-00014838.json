  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 779 Filed 08/22/22 Page 91 of 101 91 M6s2Max2 provides another example. She testified that she confided in the defendant that her mother was an alcohol and that she had been raped and molested by her grandfather starting at a very young age. The defendant, aware of this knowledge, used it to subject Carolyn to a continuing cycle of sexual abuse. The defendant wasn't an impassive observer, but herself touched Carolyn's breasts, again, at the time Carolyn was 14. For years, Carolyn was paid for the sexualized massages, including personally paid by the defendant. Similar patterns of conduct were described by other witnesses. Indeed, the criminal conduct established at trial was extensive and it was far-reaching. Ms. Maxwell and Epstein victimized multiple underaged girls using this pattern, this playbook, over the span of many years and in a variety of locations. And the damage done to these young girls was incalculable. They did bravely testify at trial about what happened to them despite the extraordinary difficulty that entailed. They withstood cross-examination from zealous defense counsel and testified credibly at trial about the trauma that they had endured and the painful, horrific, and lasting impact of that trauma. They did so, they told me in their statements, in order to help ensure justice for themselves and others and to do what they could to try to prevent other girls from suffering in the future as they had suffered.
