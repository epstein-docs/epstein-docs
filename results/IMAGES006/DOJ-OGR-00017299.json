We haven't heard anything from the jury, so I think it is time to consider putting in a note regarding tomorrow since we don't have a response on that. So the note I have drafted, with your input, let me know, \"Hello jury. If your deliberations are not completed today, do you wish to deliberate tomorrow, Thursday, December 23rd?\" And then I have a box for \"yes\" and a box for \"no.\" \"Please check yes or no. If yes, what time would you like to deliberate from? Blank a.m. to blank p.m. Judge Nathan.\n\nAny thoughts or requests?\nMS. COMEY: Seems perfect.\nMS. STERNHEIM: Fine. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: What I'll do is we'll send that in and I think everybody just wait, my assumption is it will come right back out and we'll reconvene. I'll see you in a moment.\n(Recess)\nTHE COURT: As that went in, a note came out. So I don't have a response yet, but I have a note.\n\"May we please have the following testimonies in a binder.\" The first one is Jane, Wong, Kate. There is something else written next to Jane.\nMS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I'm not reading the note, but they got Jane. It wasn't in a binder.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00017299",
