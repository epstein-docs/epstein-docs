She told you about the three different stages of memories, and that one thing that can happen is what's called autosuggestion. Basically, when people suggest things to themselves, and then they start to remember things and they start to draw inferences, and then they start to feel as if those things are actual memories. But memories come from the acquisition of the event, the retention of the information, and the retrieval. And post-event information can impact a memory at any one of those stages. If you're under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time you acquire the memory, that affects the quality of the formation of the memory in the first place. The older a memory gets, the more susceptible it is to post-event information. A little bit can come in, the older the memory is, and it can cause a contamination or a distortion or a supplementation. And news media in whatever form can include re-dramatization. Sometimes there's pressure to provide more and more details about some particular subject. I don't know. Like the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017167",
