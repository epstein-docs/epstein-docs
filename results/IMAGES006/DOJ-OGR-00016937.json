And --\n13 THE COURT: You're doing precisely what Mr. Rohrbach\n14 said, which is you're switching back and forth between the\n15 conspiracy and the substantive count. So Annie, for example,\n16 the evidence is the conduct occurred in New Mexico. That's why\n17 I gave the limiting instruction. But that could be considered\n18 with other evidence of the conspiracy with respect to New York,\n19 the violation of New York law. You don't have to have the\n20 violation of New York law to establish the elements of the\n21 conspiracy count.\n22 So the objection is overruled.\n23 Next.\n24 MR. EVERDELL: All right.
