If the government establishes each of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, then the defendant is guilty of this charge whether or not the individual agreed or consented to cross state lines. Instruction No. 21. Count Four. Transportation of an individual under the age of 17 to engage in illegal sexual activity. Second element. The second element of Count Four which the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce with the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York law. Like Count Two, Count Four alleges sexual activity for which an individual could be charged with a violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55, sexual abuse in the third degree. I've already instructed you regarding that crime, and those instructions apply equally here. In order to establish this element, it's not necessary for the government to prove that the illegal sexual activity was Ms. Maxwell's sole purpose for transporting Jane across state lines.
