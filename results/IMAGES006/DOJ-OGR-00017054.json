MOE: So in the defense case, they happened to find two people with the first names, Michelle and Ava, and they brought them down to court to try to discredit Jane. But here's the thing, Jane never testified that Michelle Healey and Eva Dubin were in the room when she was abused. She did not say that.\n\nDefense counsel asked her about a Michelle and an Eva. They expressly did not ask Jane if she knew those people's last names. They didn't show Jane pictures of Eva Dubin or Michelle Healey to see if those were the people she was referencing. They left it really vague on purpose. But trying to discredit Jane this way makes no sense. Your common sense tells you that those aren't the only Michelles and Evas in the whole wide world.\n\nAnd you can take a look at excerpts from Government Exhibit 52. That's the black contact book. Remember, there were pages from Epstein and Maxwell's contact book, and we're going to talk more about this book later. But you're going to see this book had another Eva in it and three Michelles. Of course there were other Michelles and Evas out there and other people with those names in Epstein's life. Calling these women to testify was completely meaningless and it was a total sideshow. Don't be distracted by that. It was meaningless.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the evidence tells you that Jane told you the truth at this trial because you could see and hear\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
