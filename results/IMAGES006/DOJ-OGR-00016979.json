So let me just -- 4 MR. EVERDELL: Yeah. 5 THE COURT: Hang on. So this is Instruction 36, line 11. 6 7 MR. EVERDELL: Correct. 8 THE COURT: Page 49.

So my first 23 24 objection is that I don't think you can actually consider Annie's testimony as the overt act if what's described there is 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
