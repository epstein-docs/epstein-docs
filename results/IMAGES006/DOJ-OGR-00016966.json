EVERDELL: We would reiterate, just for the purposes of the record, of including \"Jane\" as opposed to \"an individual\" or \"the individual.\" That's been overruled, but we will ask that the word \"solely\" be included on line 12, so, \"Count Four also relates solely to Jane.\"\n7 MR. ROHRBACH: No objection.\n8 THE COURT: Okay. We'll make that change. And my clerk tells me we missed an \"and foreign\" on page 25.\n9 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, yes. So we do have to go back to page 25. So on line 5, there's an \"or foreign.\"\n10 THE COURT: So that will be with the ellipses. So page 25, line 5, \"interstate... commerce...\"\n11 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.
