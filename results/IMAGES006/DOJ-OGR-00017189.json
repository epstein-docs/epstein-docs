They concede that the sexual contact happened with Epstein, but the theory is, Maxwell just had no part in it, wasn't involved. So the theory is that all four of these women had a massive false memory event that just happen to include details of the defendant grooming them in the same way using the same playbook. Your common sense tells you that didn't happen. The defense's own expert, Professor Loftus, confirmed that the core memories of trauma are solid. Peripheral details make it a little fuzzy, but those main memories, those events that are at the center are implanted. Some things you never forget because they're seared into your brain forever. You remember keen moments, moments that change your life, like Jane remembering the defendant touching her breasts, Carolyn remembering the defendant touching her breasts, Annie remembering the defendant touching her breasts, Kate remembering the defendant standing right next to her in the doorway the first time she sees Jeffrey Epstein naked, frozen with fear. There was nothing peripheral about the defendant. She was the core memory, she was essential to this scheme. And to distract you from the remarkable clarity with which these women remember those core details, the defense primarily points to how Jane and Carolyn have described aspects of their SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
