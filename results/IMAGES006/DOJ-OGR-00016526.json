We'll talk about those folks in a minute. 3 Can you describe the layout of the office space at 4 Madison Avenue from when you get off the elevator. 5 A. Sure. So you get off the elevator and immediately to your 6 left were the restrooms. Immediately in front of you was the 7 accounting team office, then the reception desk would just be 8 kind of pitched to the right. Behind the reception desk was a 9 hallway where the offices were. The legal team sat on the 10 left-side office, and that was followed by Jeffrey's office, 11 which was a corner. Directly next to Jeffrey's office and 12 directly behind the receptionist at the end of the hall would 13 have been Jeffrey Epstein's assistant, and then I sat to the 14 left of Jeffrey Epstein's assistant. So we were, like, in a 15 row. If all doors were open, I could see Jeffrey in the 16 corner, his assistant, myself. And then in my office, which 17 was Ghislaine's office, there were three desks - one was 18 Ghislaine's, one was mine, and one was the legal assistant's. 19 Q. Do you remember the legal assistant's name when you were 20 there? 21 A. Lauren Quitner (ph.). 22 Q. Lauren Quitner? 23 A. Yes. 24 Q. So in the office where you sat and where Ghislaine sat, how 25 many people actually sat in that office? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016526",
