Statement was read aloud. 596, sustained, the statement was read aloud. That's, I believe, all of the Jane statements; is that correct? MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. The parties had agreed to a few either being in or out before we submitted this, so those are part of the record your Honor just gave, but the parties know what they are. MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Menninger, for that clarification. Next, Annie. Transcript at 2151, sustained. She acknowledged the statement but said she didn't recall making it. So there is no inference of inconsistency. Transcript at 2160 to 61, sustained. Annie said -- there is not an inconsistency. Annie said she didn't recall a chef, but, quote, that makes sense to me that there was a chef there, quote. It also goes only to a collateral issue. Transcript at 2165 to 66, sustained. Statement was already read out loud, testimony is not inconsistent, and the amount of horseback riding is collateral. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016755",
