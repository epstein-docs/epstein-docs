Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury and That of Their Families\n\nThis factor is aimed primarily at protecting the reputations and interests of unindicted individuals, about whom unsealed grand jury testimony would reveal damaging information not previously disclosed. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 107. There is no such person or information here. Insofar as Maxwell was the subject of the grand jury testimony, this factor suggests considering here \"the continued existence and vulnerability\" of her and her family. Id. Maxwell is alive and so theoretically could be harmed by the disclosure of adverse testimony. But here, the grand jury materials, being cumulative of the public trial evidence, do not add anything to the formidable public record inculpating her. And no family member of hers has expressed a position on the motion to unseal. Gov't Mem. at 6. This factor is neutral.\n\n7. Extent to Which the Desired Material Has Previously Been Made Public\n\n\"[T]he extent to which the grand jury material in a particular case has been made public is clearly relevant because even partial previous disclosure often undercuts many of the reasons for secrecy.\" See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 107. Here, as explained, substantially all the information testified to by the summary witnesses in the grand juries has been revealed at Maxwell's trial. And the Government proposes to redact victim identities, consistent with the approach that it took at trial. This factor is consistent with unsealing.\n\n8. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might be Affected by Disclosure Are Still Alive\n\nBoth law enforcement agents who testified are still alive. Gov't Mem. at 7.
