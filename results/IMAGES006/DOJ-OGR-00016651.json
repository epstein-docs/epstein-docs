STERNHEIM: Judge -- THE COURT: Is her testimony on her CV? MS. STERNHEIM: No. THE COURT: I just wanted to know that. MS. STERNHEIM: I don't believe it has testimony. It's a CV of her academic pursuits, her awards, her publications. THE COURT: Not the cases she's testified. MS. STERNHEIM: No. THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead. MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, I certainly understand the desire on the part of the government to do some character assassination. But the fact of the matter, testifying in a high-profile case is being used in a way that is very insidious here. I don't understand what the purpose is. Are they getting into her testimony in that case? MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I'm happy to respond. So the witness has financial incentive to testify on behalf of the defense. It's not a question of just getting paid by the defendant in this case. Over her career she has used her testimony as a defense -- as an expert for the defense to testify at trials. In her book she has a chapter, the book that she has SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016651",
