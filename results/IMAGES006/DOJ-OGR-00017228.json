Consent by the person is not a defense to the charge in Count Six of the indictment if Carolyn was under the age of 18 at the time the commercial sex acts took place. It's also not required that the person actually performed a commercial sex act, so long as the government has proved that Ms. Maxwell recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained the person for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex acts.
