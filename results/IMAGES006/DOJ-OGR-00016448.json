MENNINGER: Okay. 3 (At sidebar) 4 5 THE COURT: Where are we going? 6 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, once the government elicits co-conspirator statements under 801(d)(2)(E), under 806, I'm allowed to impeach the declarant as though they were testifying. So I'm asking questions about Jeffrey Epstein through this witness, who is the one from whom they elicited the 801(d)(2)(E) statements. That's what I believe 806 provides. 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 THE COURT: You have a series of questions about things that Epstein didn't tell her? 14 15 MS. MENNINGER: Correct. 16 MS. MOE: Your Honor, this is all a line of argument, they are not questions. This witness doesn't know anything about it. I'm not sure what the basis is for trying to impeach Jeffrey Epstein's credibility through this particular witness. It's all argument. 17 18 19 20 21 THE COURT: We're not going to do ten -- 22 MS.
