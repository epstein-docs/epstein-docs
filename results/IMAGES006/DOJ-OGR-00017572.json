How did you go to see the guidance counselor when you were in the 7th grade? 4 A. Well, actually, she asked to speak to me. She called me in her office and said -- asked me what was going on at home, if we had been or I had been in grief counseling and how my mother was doing. So I told her how I was feeling and how sad I was and, you know, how unavailable my mother was and how unsupportive and there was really no one for me to talk to. So I spoke to her and she was -- she was lovely and she would -- when she would see me. She would say if you need a place to go, just come to my office and sit there and we'll talk. 14 Q. After you spoke with the guidance counselor, did there come a time when you learned that your mother had become aware about the conversations you were having with the guidance counselor? 17 A. Yes. I came home from school one day and my mother said that the guidance counselor had called her and had said that she wanted to see her because she was very worried about me. My mother proceeded to berate me and scream at me and slap me and tell me how dare I talk about myself and our family and that it was an embarrassment, and that you don't tell other people about your feelings or what's going on at home. 24 Q. I want to pause here and ask a few questions about the sexual abuse you described experiencing when you were 14 and SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017572",
