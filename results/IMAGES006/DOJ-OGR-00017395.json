And about when do you remember her moving into the brownstone townhouse you mentioned? A. I'd only be guessing if I said the 2000s, but I don't have an exact era. It had to have been in the 2000s, I believe. Q. In what borough were all three of those residences? A. They were in Manhattan. Q. Why did you go to those residences? A. It was -- it was still luggage; we would actually go there to pick up luggage for the flights. I would actually go there sometimes to get an expense report signed. And then also at the brownstone I did -- she had the sixth floor up there that had a home theater that I installed with a flat screen TV, so I would occasionally go there and support, you know, help tune and adjust that. Q. Would you please describe the interior of Ms. Maxwell's brownstone townhouse. A. I believe it was a five or six-story building or home. You entered the front door, it brought you into a courtyard or I should say an entrance foyer. And then once you started -- you walk up the first stairs to the first -- to the first level you got to, that was kind of the living room and also had the kitchen. So in the front of the house of the brownstone was the living room, then there was a dining room, and then further back of that was the kitchen. And then you went to the next SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017395",
