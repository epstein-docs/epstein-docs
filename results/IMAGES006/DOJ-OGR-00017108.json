You also heard the manipulation of other storylines, and I'll go through them, that Ghislaine is at the center of all this, she's the right-hand woman, she's Cruella Devil and the lady wears Prada all wrapped into one. This is a manipulation of the truth as old as Hollywood, your Honor, and ladies and gentlemen, and don't be fooled by it. With the money on the line, the accusers' goal of holding someone accountable for Jeffrey Epstein, who was dead at the forefront, and the tape recorders turned off, the accusers' memories started to shift. Earlier, Carolyn said it was Sarah Kellen, now she's says it was Ghislaine Maxwell. Before Jane said she met only Epstein on a park bench at Interlochen, now she saw Ghislaine walk by and then, oh, by the time she got to trial, it was Ghislaine who stopped and talked to her. Before it was, I have no specific recollection of Ghislaine being in the room when it happened. That became, I remember it being once or twice or all the time. Before it was, I can't remember anything about a sexualized foot massage. Now Annie hears Jeffrey moaning with pleasure. Professor Loftus explained to you that's not how memory works.
