You should draw no inference or conclusion for or against any party by reason of lawyers making objections or my rulings on such objections. Counsel have not only the right, but the duty to make legal objections that they think are appropriate. You should not be swayed against the government or the defendant simply because counsel for either side has chosen to make an objection. Similarly, statements made by counsel when arguing the admissibility of evidence are not to be considered as evidence. If I comment on the evidence during my instructions, do not accept my statements in place of your recollection. Again, it is your recollection that governs. Do not concern yourself with what was said at sidebar conferences or during my discussions with counsel. Those discussions related to rulings of law, which are my duty, and not to matters of fact, which are your duty to determine. At times I may have admonished a witness or directed a witness to be responsive to questions or to keep his or her voice up or to repeat an answer. My instructions were intended only to clarify the presentation of evidence. You should draw no inference or conclusion of any kind, favorable or unfavorable, with respect to any witness or party in the case by reason of any comment, question, or instruction of mine. Nor should you infer that I have any views as to the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017209",
