MS. STERNHEIM: The papers that we filed last night specifically state the basis upon which we are seeking to introduce this. I made this available at the time of the testimony. It is dated at a time that occurred during the course of the trial related to the testimony of their witness. I don't see why it is a Rule 16 violation -- THE COURT: Well, I think they're not actually arguing that. So, Mr. Rohrbach, for the proposition that the denial can't be impeached by extrinsic evidence, cited Second Circuit case, United States v. Harvey, 547 F.2d 720, \"...that a cross examiner is not required to, quote, take the answer, end quote, of a witness concerning possible bias, but may proffer extrinsic evidence, including the testimony of other witnesses to prove the facts showing a bias in favor of or against a party. You agree that's the law, you're just saying that there is not an available inference to the jury of bias from the \"it fell into my lap.\" MR. ROHRBACH: That's right, your Honor. That inference only becomes available when that statement is SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016632",
