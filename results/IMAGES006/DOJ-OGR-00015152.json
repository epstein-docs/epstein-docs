None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a result of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a \"special circumstance\" that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that doing so would expose as disingenuous the Government's public explanations for moving to unseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at \"transparency\" but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.

The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi's testimony, redacted to protect others' names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi appealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without redactions.
