We're going to break a little bit early today and resume, as I said, on Thursday at our normal time, with the next phase of the case, which is the defense case.\n3 Because we're going to be apart for five days, I'm going to just take a minute to carefully remind you of all my instructions. And I know that you know this, but it's important, since we're moving to the next phase of the case.\n4 No consumption of any kind of media or information through any means about the case. No discussions with each other or anyone else about the case or anyone involved in the case. No communications with anyone through any means about the case. And although the government has rested, it's important to keep an open mind, as I've said, until we get to the next stage of the case and through to the later stages until you begin your deliberations.\n5 With that, I bid you a happy Friday and a good weekend, a long weekend for us. I will see you Thursday. We'll start promptly at 9:30 on Thursday morning.\n6 Thank you so much.\n7 (Jury excused)\n8 THE COURT: Matters to take up.\n9 MR.
