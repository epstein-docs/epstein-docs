He used his position to manipulate people and play them off against one another. Juan Alessi told you -- despite their one quote the government showed you about Ghislaine being the lady of the house when she first started, that, in 2016, Mr. Alessi testified it was Epstein who was his direct supervisor. And if Epstein was in the house, he would never go to Ghislaine, he would go directly to Epstein. And let's talk a little bit about Mr. Alessi. Mr. Alessi worked for Epstein for many years. But you can tell from the one email exchange, Government Exhibit 424, between Ghislaine and Sally Markham that Mr. Alessi was not doing a very good job. In fact, I think she called it a truly awful job. So we know the two of them weren't getting along. But does being a tough boss make you an enforcer of a code of silence? Mr. Alessi is simply not credible. He said he didn't follow the household manual, which is dated years later. He threw it away. Not one employee told you they followed this household manual. He's also the one that the government tried to get in this little black address book from, right? He's the one. He said he recognized it; it looked like the one he had seen. He has no idea what year it's from. He doesn't know how accurate it is; that people get added every year and taken away every year. So somehow in 2021, a black address book shows up on the year.
