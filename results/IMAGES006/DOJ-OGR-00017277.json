Sorry you're a little delayed getting you out of here, I know it's a long day. Thank you for your diligence and your attention.\nI want to of course remind you, bear all of my instructions in mind, even though we're at the deliberations, especially because and in addition we're at the deliberation stage of the case.\nSo just to reiterate, no communications with each other or -- no communications outside of the jury room with each other or anyone else regarding the case, no consuming any information regarding the case in any way.\nI'm going to ask that you resume your deliberations tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. You come straight into the jury room. Once all 12 of you are there, you begin your deliberations, not before, but once all 12 of you are there. Just start right away again with your deliberations, you don't have to wait for further instruction for me. If you have questions, you put them in a note and I'll get you a response. Ms. Williams will get your lunch order. Even though we're at this phase in the case, please continue to keep an open mind until you're together deliberating in the jury room.\nHave a goodnight.
