So to the extent that we know everybody pays attention to and attaches significance to some aspects of an event more so than others, what a sexual abuse survivor discloses and the pieces of the story that they -- or their experiences, I'm sorry -- that they remember are going to be those things that were central details. They are going to have relatively good memory most of the time for the gist of the event and for the details that they attended to and were most significant to them. But their memory for peripheral details, we know, can fade away and weaken or change with time. Q. You just mentioned peripheral details. What do you mean by that? A. So in the memory literature, again, there is often a distinction made between what are considered to be central details and peripheral details. So the central details are subjectively defined as whatever it is an individual is paying attention to and attaching significance to at the time of an event. And those are the details that get encoded in memory and are then later available for retrieval at the time of recall. Q. Can you give an example. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
