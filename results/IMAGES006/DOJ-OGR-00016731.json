Before that, anything, counsel?\nMS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, there is one witness that we have under subpoena who has not been in contact with us that we very much would like to call as a witness. I can say the name out loud or we can have a sidebar, but it is one of the witnesses about whom the government moved to preclude their testimony and your Honor ruled last night that we would be permitted to put that testimony on. All of our attempts to have communication with this witness after the service of subpoena have gone unresponded to. So I think, at this point, we have no choice left except to ask to have intervention of the marshals to bring that witness to court to testify.\nTHE COURT: You'll have to file something.\nMS. MENNINGER: Yes.\nTHE COURT: Ms. Comey, anything on that?\nMS. COMEY: Your Honor, this is the first time hearing of this. We'll have to see whatever is filed.\nTHE COURT: Obviously, if you've got authority for how to proceed, you need to put that in quickly because we're not delaying trial.\nMS. MENNINGER: Secondly, your Honor, with respect to the pleading that was filed yesterday or the day before\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
