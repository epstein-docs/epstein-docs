Carolyn told you that she got packages from Epstein from New York, and she did. You can see that here in black and white. That's Government Exhibits 801, 802, and 803.\n2 Who else was sending packages from Epstein's office from this very same time period? Maxwell. She used the same account to send packages. You see Maxwell's name on each of these FedEx account invoices. Maxwell was a part of the operation just like Carolyn told you.\n3 You also learned about phone messages that Carolyn left in the Palm Beach house on those message pads. Those phone messages corroborate Carolyn's testimony. They prove to you that she was there.\n4 So let's talk about two of them.\n5 First, this is Government Exhibit 608. Carolyn testified that this was her mother's phone number. She wrote it down so she wouldn't have to say it out loud at trial, and we marked it as an exhibit. That same phone number is all over the message pads from the Palm Beach house, phone message after message.\n6 This is Government Exhibit 1-B. It's the same phone number, and that's Carolyn's full name, first and last. It's from 2004. And remember, we were just looking at FedEx records from 2002. What's the message here? That she wants to work for Epstein today. What you were looking at is a phone message\n7 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n8 DOJ-OGR-00017067",
