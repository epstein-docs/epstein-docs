Where's the normalizing going on there? And by the way, this story about normalizing and making it seem casual, Jane told you when she was first abused she was taken alone into a pool room -- pool house where Epstein masturbated on her. Ghislaine wasn't even there and she's trying to make it seem like she thought that was normal because she got one joke about boyfriends? Use your common sense. Then again, there's that promise that you would learn that sometimes Ghislaine was in the room when it happened, except Jane can't actually remember any one of those times or what happened during those times. Finally, the government promised you a motive, and the motive that they came up with was that Ghislaine, a happy, educated, beautiful woman in her 30s would just start and end her career as a facilitator of sexual abuse for one man, Jeffrey Epstein, because they said he was a means to support her lifestyle and she needed to stay in a lifestyle to which she had become accustomed. That's why they claim she became a facilitator of sexual abuse, and where was the evidence they delivered to you about that? First, it was clear Epstein was a manipulator of everyone around him. He's having Juan Alessi take down photos of Ghislaine when he brings other women to the house. He's dating women behind her back. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017115",
