This destitute, homeless, penniless Jane. In May of '98, she says she's singing to Mike Wallace for his birthday, his 80th birthday, and she estimated she was 15 or 16 years old, but it turns out he turned 80 when she was 17, almost 18 years old. So she got that date wrong by a few years, as well. Upon graduation, she left for LA, but before that, she went to high school, and this is the only document from 1998 when she's 18 that shows Mr. Epstein paying for anything for her. High school, not Interlochen. She attends the professional school and when she goes off to LA, she writes back to Epstein, as you see on these photos, Jeffrey, thanks for rocking my world, you're the best, love, Jane. She said her mom made her send that photo, but again, you didn't hear from her mom. She continues to fly on Epstein's planes when she's 19 and 20 and 21. I asked her about those flights that were paid for by the Shoppers Travel witness you saw, and she didn't remember that she kept taking flights on his dime when she was 20 and 21. And then you will see and hear from on the flight logs, in a moment, that she said she was on numerous flights with famous people. You may recall she said she flew with Prince Andrew, for example, and Mark Epstein, and Epstein's SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017123",
