Government Exhibit 16 accurately reflects the date of birth of the person named on the certificate. It is further stipulated and agreed that this stipulation, marked as Government Exhibit 1004, and Government Exhibits 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 may be received in evidence at trial. At this time, your Honor, the government offers all of the exhibits I just named. THE COURT: Mr. Everdell. MR. EVERDELL: No objection. THE COURT: Without objection and on stipulation, Government Exhibit 1004 is admitted, as are Government Exhibit 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16. (Government's Exhibits 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 1004 received in evidence) MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would note that the parties have agreed that Government Exhibits 11 through 16 would be submitted under seal. And I would ask for authorization to have the jurors pick up their binders of sealed exhibits so that we may look at one of those in a moment. THE COURT: Okay. And the sealing is consistent with my ruling that some of the witnesses are able to testify under pseudonyms. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017410",
