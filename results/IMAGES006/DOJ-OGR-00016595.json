How many years would you say you have been a psychologist in the field of memory science?\n2 A. Well, at least since I got my Ph.D. in 1970. But I actually published a few articles while I was still a graduate student with my professors as coauthors.\n3 Q. Well, let's begin at 1970. From 1970 to this year, 2021, approximately how many articles, if you could estimate, have you published?\n4 A. Well, I've published over 20 books and probably over 600 scientific articles and chapters.\n5 Q. And are all of them in your CV?\n6 A. I believe just about everything I've published is listed in the CV, and that's why it takes so many pages.\n7 Q. In addition to the publications that you have discussed in the books that you have written, have you also coauthored in other people's books, such as chapters and textbooks and otherwise?\n8 A. Yes, I've coauthored a number of chapters, but that would have been included in the 600 estimate that I've given you already.\n9 Q. Okay. Now, I'd like to speak to you briefly about the research that you've conducted.\n10 Is it possible for you to approximate how many research experiments you've conducted at least from 1970 to the\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016595",
