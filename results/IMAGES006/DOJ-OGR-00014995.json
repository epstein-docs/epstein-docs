So you are making an assumption that whatever you are hearing is accurate; correct? A. It depends on the context whether or not I'm making that assumption. Q. You would make that assumption in order to label it grooming; correct? A. I would, for example, in a forensic context, I wouldn't say this is grooming or grooming happened. I would say the individual described behaviors that are consistent with grooming, for example. Q. But for purposes of your testimony in this case, when you're talking about what you're describing as grooming, there's an underlying assumption that either there's an attempted sexual assault or exploitation or actual sexual assault or exploitation, otherwise it's not grooming; correct? A. I wouldn't agree that it's an assumption. It's part of the definition. So -- Q. We're kind of going circular here. THE COURT: Yes. So we'll move on. There are fruitful arguments in cross-examination here, I hope you'll get to that soon. MR. PAGLIUCA: Thank you, your Honor. BY MR. PAGLIUCA: SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
