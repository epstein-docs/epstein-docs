Approximately when was that? A. The end of 2002. Q. And why did you stop seeing him at the end of 2002? A. Because I fell madly in love with someone, and we got very quickly engaged. And Jeffrey would call me. And my new fiancé would ask, Who is this person who calls you and that you sort of have to drop everything for to take that call? And I said, Oh, it's -- that's my godfather. And he just kind of said, Well, what do you mean your godfather? You just tell him you'll call him back. I said, No, it doesn't work that way. And he had a pretty abrasive personality himself, this guy. And he said, Well, don't call him back. And that was sort of -- well, that wasn't the end of it. I didn't call him back. And then he tried contacting me again and leaving me voicemails that became increasingly agitated in saying that I need to call him back, he was coming into town to visit, and he wanted to see me, and that I need to be grateful and remember what he's done for me. Because my mother had still been living in an apartment in New York after I moved away that he was paying for. And then I didn't return his call. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
