Just to be able to see the binder before it's passed out to jurors, because they'll have a binder full of paper and be flipping through it to turn to exhibits. We just want to have chance to lay eyes on that binder in an abundance of caution. I've note that we have done the same; we've provided defense counsel with a copy of the binders that we plan to hand out.\nTHE COURT: Can you come closer to the mic please.\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\nI would just note that we've done the same; we've provided defense counsel with a copy of the binders that we intend to pass out to the jurors so they can examine it.\nMR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, what we would like to do is follow the practice of this Court that it's been doing forever, as far as I know, which is that before we show anything to the witness, we will show it to the government and we will show it to the Court and the Court's deputy so that they can see what we are showing to the witness. But we do not want to give them a whole binder of cross materials before the cross begins.\nTHE COURT: All right. That's fine. But in that case, we won't place the binder with the jury --\nMR. EVERDELL: That's fine.\nTHE COURT: -- in advance.\nMR. EVERDELL: That's fine.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016118",
