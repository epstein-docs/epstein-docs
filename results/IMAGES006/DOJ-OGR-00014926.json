And then beneath each stage level, there is a list of the behavioral and the observable and measurable behaviors where there was a high level of statistical significance in agreement among varying professionals as to the relevance both to the grooming process and to the stages. Q. I want to direct your attention to Page 4. What is this table? A. So these, as I mentioned, there was an original list of about 77 specific behaviors that have been found associated with grooming in the literature fairly consistently. These are the behaviors that were part of that original list, where perhaps there were more differences of opinion, but the level of agreement among the professionals in this particular study did not reach the level of statistical significance. Q. What is your takeaway from the study in the article? A. I think this is a study that has really done a good job of integrating what we know and pulling together the literature, and then putting it to an empirical test. There have been other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred to as grooming. I think this is another way that provides some validation of a proposed model of the ways in which grooming works. MS. POMERANTZ: You can pull that down. I'd like to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
