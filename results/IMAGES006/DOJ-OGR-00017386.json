On occasion I would go to pick up luggage and drop off luggage at that place. But I would almost say every trip, but we didn't go to Paris that often, so I'll even go as far as saying most every trip. Q. Other than to pick up luggage, did you go to that apartment for any other reason? A. Yeah. I also did some audio work on the home theater that he had in the Paris apartment as well. MS. COMEY: Ms. Drescher, could we please pull up Government Exhibit 705 for the witness, the Court, and the parties. Q. Mr. Visoski, do you recognize this? A. Yes. Q. What is it? A. That is the exterior of the Paris apartment. Q. Is this a fair and accurate depiction of the exterior of the building in which Mr. Epstein's apartment was located? A. That is correct, yes, it is. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the government offers this in evidence. MR. EVERDELL: No objection. THE COURT: GX-705 is admitted and you may publish. (Government's Exhibit 705 received in evidence) MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017386",
