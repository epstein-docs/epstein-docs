Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse, sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again, developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of being judged. And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble. They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you know, studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.
