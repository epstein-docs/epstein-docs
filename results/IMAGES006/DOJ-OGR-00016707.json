As a CBP officer, is it important to your job to understand whether the CBP records you are reviewing are thorough and accurate?\n3 A. Yes.\n4 Q. And in your day-to-day work as a CBP officer, do you rely on CBP records from before 9/11 to be complete?\n5 A. We'd like to rely on or hope that the records are complete, but not necessarily all the time, no.\n6 Q. And why is that the case that records before 9/11 are not necessarily complete?\n7 A. Prior to 9/11, there was a little bit of a difference between how the records were submitted to CBP systems and the reliability of the airlines was not as good as it is now or after 9/11.\n8 Q. And when did that start to change in terms of when did the records start to be more complete and thorough?\n9 A. After 9/11, there were several acts put into place by the U.S. Government. The Department of Homeland Security was created. And basically, the airline industry was at one point mandated now to submit more complete records to CBP. I feel comfortable saying -- as far as the status indicators, I feel comfortable saying roughly 2009, 2010, based on the records that I have ran in my experience, you would see more onboard or not onboard status.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
