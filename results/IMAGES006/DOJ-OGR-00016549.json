I think it was because she went to go work in California for a soap opera. Q. And how do you know that she ended up working for a soap opera? A. She told me and I also saw it myself, because it's one of my soap operas I watched my entire life. Q. Are you a fan of this particular soap opera? A. Big time. Q. And did you see Jane on the soap opera? A. Yes. Q. After she moved to LA and was on the soap opera, did you have any continuing contact with Jane? A. Only when she would call the office. Q. Any other type of contact with Jane after she stopped coming to the office and was in LA? A. Yes. She sent me a little envelope with headshots, signed headshots of the cast from the soap opera, a few single headshots and then the whole cast all signed. Q. Is that something that you asked for or did she send that to you as a gift? A. I think it was a gift. Q. Do you remember roughly when she sent you those headshots? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
