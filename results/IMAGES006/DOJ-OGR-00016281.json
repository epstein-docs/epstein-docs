Farmer - direct 1 (At sidebar) 2 THE COURT: Is this not a prior consistent statement 3 that was litigated or discussed? 4 MS. POMERANTZ: This is a prior consistent statement, 5 your Honor. 6 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I don't believe that we 7 have impeached her yet or called her story into question in 8 opening about this issue. So I'm a little -- I understand that 9 eventually it may be, if I do impeach her. 10 THE COURT: The opening questioned the veracity of all 11 of the accusers. 12 MS. MENNINGER: Not on every point, your Honor. I 13 mean -- 14 THE COURT: Okay. 15 MS. MENNINGER: Not that she was there, for example, 16 or anything like that. So I don't believe that it's been 17 opened, and I think it's just bolstering. 18 THE COURT: Well, is the statement just that she's 19 going to be there or what's -- what is the anticipated 20 statement? 21 MS. MENNINGER: Actually, my reading of the discovery 22 is that she told her mom, I wasn't raped. And so if that's 23 what is planned to be elicited, that's going to be a problem 24 for a lot of other reasons that have been litigated. 25 THE COURT: Is that what she's going to say?
