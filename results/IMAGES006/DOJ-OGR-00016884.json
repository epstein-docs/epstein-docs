And 2 we actually had to confirm that he had relevant information 3 before I proffered him as a witness in this case. And now 4 we've been able to do that and that's the one when, yesterday, 5 at the end of the day, I told the Court that we may have one 6 additional witness, that's who I was referring to. 7 Your Honor, actually, I'm sorry. It was yesterday 8 because this issue came up after the property issue was 9 discussed earlier in the day, and we felt like we had to find 10 somebody who could establish her residency at 44 Kinnerton 11 instead of not just her ownership. We were able to find 12 Mr. Moran. 13 THE COURT: I mean, again, I find it amusing, somehow. 14 The government moved to preclude the ownership documents on 15 Kinnerton. 16 MR. EVERDELL: I understand the Court's ruling and if 17 that's the basis -- 18 THE COURT: I'm letting it in. I'm letting it. I 19 queried the relevance of it because it was ownership, not 20 residence, but I'm letting it in because I think you persuaded 21 me that you can argue the inference of residence from 22 ownership. 23 MR. EVERDELL: And, your Honor -- I'm sorry. 24 THE COURT: Just -- all along, I gather that was what 25 the defense intended to do, to establish timing of residence; SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
