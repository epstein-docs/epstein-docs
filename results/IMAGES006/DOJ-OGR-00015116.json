What is your next step? What is the end game? I ask the United States Government, that so rightfully wants to release the \"sealed\" documents not all the victims have seen themselves. At least give us notice when you decide to make these decisions, like moving her into a minimum-security prison camp.\n\nI think the victims have a right to hear the audio without redactions. I think the victims should be able to see what the FBI took from his, NYC mansion, FL mansion and USVI private island resort. I think we should be able to see ALL the files. I think any photos or videos of the victims should be given back to them. NOT REVIEWED BY CONGRESS, GROSS!!!!\n\nWill justice ever be served? I question what that would look like to the DOJ, the FBI, because so far we have got nothing, not even an apology, not even the answers we so long for. We all want closure and for this \"distraction\" to stop! This is some type of psychological games, by keeping the public ignorant. The very fact that something is secret means there is something to hide.\n\nI support the United States Senate Committee on Finance lead by Senator Wyden, \"Follow-the-Money\" Investigation of Epstein Finances. I thank him and his team for their work, but I request more transparency. I think the victims lawyers should have access to all these findings. We have a right to take legal action against these institutions and/or individuals involved in Epstein's and co-conspirators crimes.\n\nIt has been super unfortunate the way the US Government has handle this ordeal. We as victims want answers, but not only us. I think the general public is exhausted also by all of this. The general public cares more about their own personal wellbeing, right? Unfortunately, for us victims, this story will NEVER go away. There will always be an interest in the case of Epstein and Maxwell. Ghislaine's trial was based off of the fact that Jeffrey could never be tried and died by \"killing himself\". Why oh why will we have to live with this conspiracy for the rest of our lives? Because they keep laboring the truth, scrubbing the data. It is so hurtful and a detriment to the victims to continue disregarding our feeling, our traumas. Please I ask you to consider our well-being first. Please I ask that the true redactions that come first are only for the victims.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n2 of 2\nDOJ-OGR-00015116",
