  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 763 Filed 08/10/22 Page 48 of 197 2589 LCHVMAX2 there were thousands of photographs seized, and that there was only obviously a subset that was presented to the jury. MS. MENNINGER: Right. Ms. Meder only was speaking to photographs, your Honor, not to the number of devices. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would note that that was a situation where we called a witness affirmatively in our case to talk about photographic evidence that was seized; and then the defense properly cross-examined that witness about that evidence. What the defense is now suggesting they should be able to do is bring in a whole host of other investigative steps. There was Mr. Flatley, who testified about extraction from a single hard drive. I believe what Mr. Everdell is talking about is all of the other devices that were seized throughout the course of this investigation. And I think that that would be in violation of the Court's order. It would also be extremely confusing, because when we're talking about this investigation, it's a little ambiguous what we're talking about, as we alluded to earlier. This investigation was broader than just what resulted in these charges. MS. MENNINGER: Well, your Honor, there was a search that the government elicited information about that occurred in 2019 of our alleged co-conspirator's home. The question can be phrased because they -- THE COURT: Which witness was that? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016777",
