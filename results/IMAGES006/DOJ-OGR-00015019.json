POMERANTZ: No objection, your Honor. 2 THE COURT: Is admitted to the hearing record. 3 (Defendant's Exhibit B received in evidence) 4 MR. PAGLIUCA: If we could pull up Exhibit 6, please. 5 THE COURT: Government 6? 6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, please. 7 BY MR. PAGLIUCA: 8 Q. Exhibit 6 is the study that you appear to have relied on with regard to disclosure issues. Is that correct? 9 10 A. It's something I submitted in part, yes. 11 Q. Well, as you sit here today, can you tell us anything else that you submitted with regard to your testimony about delayed disclosure and supporting literature? 12 13 A. I couldn't give you a list, but, again, my opinions are not based on any one article or even solely on my knowledge of the literature. It's based on an interaction of the totality of my education, training, skills, experience, and knowledge of the scientific and clinical and professional literature. 14 15 Q. OK. So looking at Exhibit 6, this is a survey, essentially, of a number of publications that talk about barriers of disclosure. Correct? 16 17 A. So my understanding is, this was a study that was looking at, understanding that delayed disclosure is very common, they were trying to determine what sorts of things present as barriers to disclosure and as facilitators of disclosure. 18 19 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
