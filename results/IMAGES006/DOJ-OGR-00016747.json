The record\n11   will reflect when you learned when the government will likely\n12   rest, the record will reflect what you said regarding when you\n13   learned of a nonresponsive witness, and the record will reflect\n14   that I will take an application within a half an hour with an\n15   opportunity for the government to respond all in the interest\n16   of conforming to my standard practice, which is everybody has\n17   their next witness or be prepared to rest or bring in a\n18   different witness.\n19       Now, we'll take it as it comes.
