And you testified earlier that you often didn't meet the passengers on the flights, you were just given their names sometimes before takeoff; right? 4 A. Correct. 5 Q. So, for all you know, there may have been many other people with that same first name as Jane's first name who traveled on Epstein's planes? 6 A. True. 7 Q. But the bottom line is, you don't know whether Jane was on any of those three flights where there is a passenger listed with Jane's true first name? 8 A. Not the three flights you made reference to. Without the last name, I didn't know which one you were referring to or who it was. 9 Q. Thank you. I want to ask you just about a few more flights. 10 A. Sure. 11 Q.
