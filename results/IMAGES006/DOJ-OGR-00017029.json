She was a grown woman who preyed on vulnerable kids, young girls from struggling families. She targeted a girl whose father had just died. She targeted a girl whose mother was an alcoholic. She targeted a girl with a single mom who was struggling to raise her daughters. Maxwell was a sophisticated predator who knew exactly what she was doing. She ran the same playbook again and again and again. She manipulated her victims and she groomed them for sexual abuse. She caused deep and lasting harm to young girls. It is time to hold her accountable.\n\nOver the last few weeks, you've seen and heard a lot of evidence. You've heard from witnesses from all walks of life. You heard powerful testimony from women who told you about traumatizing events from their childhoods. You heard from people they talked to years ago about those events who corroborated their testimony. You heard from law enforcement officers who searched the properties where these crimes happened. You heard from employees who worked for Maxwell and Epstein.\n\nIn addition to those witnesses, you've seen documents, phone messages, FedEx records, a household manual, and a little black book with victim names. You also saw bank records showing the $30 million that Jeffrey Epstein paid to Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this summation is our SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
