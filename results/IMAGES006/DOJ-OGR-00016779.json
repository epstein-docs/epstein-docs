But she reviewed, I\n2 believe, every file that was extracted from the devices; so she\n3 knows generally how many there were and what types there were.\n4 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we put on the witness who\n5 extracted all of the files from all of these devices. That's\n6 Stephen Flatley. He was on the stand. And we put on a witness\n7 who reviewed all the photographs. That was Kimberly Meder.\n8 She was on the stand.\n9 What the defense wants to do now is impeach the\n10 investigation, that is what this is about.\n11 THE COURT: Okay.\n12 You had the opportunity to ask witnesses put on by the\n13 government. Consistent with my ruling, to the extent they put\n14 the thoroughness of the investigation -- I wouldn't say it was\n15 thoroughness, but they put the relevant agent who you could\n16 have crossed on this on the stand. And maybe there would have\n17 been an objection, to the extent you were calling into question\n18 the thoroughness of the investigation without it being raised.\n19 I might not have permitted it there, but I certainly won't\n20 permit it further removed as direct evidence of the\n21 thoroughness of the government's investigation and\n22 investigative steps, which is precluded by my November 1st\n23 ruling.\n24 MR.
