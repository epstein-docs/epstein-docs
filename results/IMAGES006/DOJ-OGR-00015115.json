Engelmayer, U.S.D.J.\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\n\nHon. Richard M. Berman, U.S.D.J.\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\n500 Pearl Street\nNew York, New York 10007-1312\n\nRe: United States of America vs. Maxwell, 1:20-cr-00330-PAE\nUnited States of America vs. Epstein, 1:19-cr-00490-RMB\n\nDear Hon. Judge Engelmayer and Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nI have been taken aback from all the monumental and more recently disheartening things that have taken place between the time Epstein was arrested, the trial that occurred verse Maxwell with Hon. Judge Alison Nathan and now with the letter I write to you today.\n\nThis is all very exhausting. As a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell and the co-conspirators who were never indicted, you can try to imagine the bewilderment I feel from the latest happenings. Also, the news that came out today in regards to potentially releasing audio of the interview between Maxwell and Todd Blanche and the various subpoenas.\n\nI think the more concerning thing to me are the subpoena's. Why not subpoena the United States Virgin Island's officials that were working with Epstein to allow him to further his sex-trafficking of girls across inter-continental and international lines? \"Jeffrey Epstein used the money Black paid him to partially fund his operations in the Virgin Islands.\" [https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/following-new-epstein-revelations-wyden-renews-demand-for-trump-administration-to-produce-epstein-files]\n\nWhy not subpoena the long-time attorney and accountant Epstein had working by his side? Once again, I just feel like the direction this administration is going is all wrong. AND, what was it that his accountant took from his 71st Street NY mansion the day after he \"killed himself\"? https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7498903/Executor-Epsteins-estate-removed-bag-pedophiles-mansion-day-killed-himself.html\n\nIn terms of the audio file that will most likely be redacted once again scrubbing the names of the wealthy and such off the recordings is once again NOT transparency. Unfortunately, the public will never be satisfied and the victims will continue to live this nightmare. I am so confused. Why rewind and go back to the convicted sex trafficker for questioning after all these almost 4\n\n1 of 2\n\nDOJ-OGR-00015115",
