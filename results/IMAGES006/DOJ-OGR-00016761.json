There is no -- there\n2 is lots of things that you might expect to be part of the case\n3 that are not here. The main reason for that is that the age of\n4 the case, especially the allegations in the 1990s are quite old\n5 and these records don't exist anymore. So I think it's fair to\n6 raise to the agent the absence of evidence, that evidence\n7 through the agent. That's one topic.\n8 THE COURT: So, for example, give me your example\n9 question on emails.\n10 MR. EVERDELL: It's in here somewhere, your Honor. As\n11 part of your investigating the case, you tried to gather as\n12 much documentary evidence as you can to corroborate what the\n13 witnesses are telling you, isn't that right. I imagine the\n14 answer is going to be yes to that. And given the age of the\n15 case, there were no emails from the 1990s, there are\n16 allegations in this case from the 1990s, correct, yeah. There\n17 are no emails that you have for any of the accusing witnesses\n18 who testified against Ms. Maxwell from the 1990s, is that\n19 right, yes. Because, in fact, in the 1990s, nobody used email,\n20 it wasn't very popular, it was just starting, yes. So because\n21 the allegations are over 25 years old, there are no emails in\n22 this case from that period, isn't that right, yes, there is no\n23 emails. Same thing about phone --\n24 THE COURT: I'm sorry. I cut you off, Mr. Everdell.\n25 Same thing about phone records?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00016761",
