During that same period between 1994 and 2004, how much notice would you typically receive before a flight on one of Mr. Epstein's planes?\nA. It was typically short notice. It could be a day notice. Probably -- a day notice at least, sometimes shorter notice, but it was -- it was short notice.\nQ. Again, focusing on that same period between 1994 and 2004, based on your observations of Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein, did they appear to have a personal relationship?\nA. From what I could see, I thought it was more personal than business, yes.\nQ. What did you observe, for example, that gave you that impression?\nA.
