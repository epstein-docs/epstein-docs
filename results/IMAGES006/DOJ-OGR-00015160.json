Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the Case in Question\n\nThe Government identifies under this factor the privacy interests of victims and third parties referenced in the grand jury materials. Id. The Government proposes to redact their names and other personally identifying information. On the Court's review, the proposed redactions would satisfactorily do so. This factor is neutral.\n\n10. Perspectives of Epstein's and Maxwell's Victims\n\nThe Court has received, and reviewed with care and great respect, letters on behalf of numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell. See Dkts. 804, 806. Their letters address whether the Maxwell grand jury materials should be disclosed. They also express broader concerns about recent Government actions with respect to Maxwell and the Epstein-Maxwell investigation.\n\nThe letters, in the main, urge broad disclosure of the Government's investigative records regarding Epstein and Maxwell. Consistent with this view, they generally support release of the Maxwell grand jury materials, provided that, before release, any records be rigorously redacted to protect identities and privacy. See, e.g., Dkt. 804 at 6 (\"We are in full agreement with the public disclosure of the grand jury transcripts, and further state that all Epstein-related information and documents in the possession and control of law enforcement, prosecutorial[,] and other government agents and entities should be fully disclosed.\")\n\nThis factor therefore favors unsealing. But there is an important qualification. The victims' interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the understandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information. See, e.g., id. at 10 (\"Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would allow additional important information to emerge . . .\"); id. at 9 (\"[T]he instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes.\"). The Government had, after all, publicly portrayed these as \"critical pieces of an important moment in our nation's history.\" Motion to 28\n\nDOJ-OGR-00015160",
