It need not have been her only purpose or motivation, but it must have been more than merely incidental. It must have been one of the dominant purposes of the trip. MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, all that the law requires is that it be one of the dominant purposes of the trip, which is the instruction that the defense originally sought and the Court gave. It's the practice, as Sand endorses, to rephrase \"dominant\" as \"significant or motivating purpose\" to avoid confusion, because it doesn't have to be the sole dominant purpose, it just has to be a dominant purpose, and so from Sand, that creates ambiguity that it has to be a sufficient -- such a big purpose that it's the dominant purpose, which is not what is required by the statute. This instruction suggests there's an additional requirement, which is that it be some sort of conscious purpose to engage in the particular criminal violation suggesting knowledge of the criminal statute and criminal prohibition. All the Miller case does is affirm that this instruction is not error.
