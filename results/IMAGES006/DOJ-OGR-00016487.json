After careful consideration, with one exception, the information the defense seeks to elicit from the three attorneys, I conclude, is either not relevant under Rule 401, is duplicative of information elicited on cross-examination and, therefore, outweighed by prejudice, or is only potentially marginally relevant to the limited inference of impeachment so as to be outweighed by 403 prejudice. The one question I intend to permit is the one I suggested the parties stipulate to testimony from Mr. Glassman. I will permit Mr. Glassman to be asked the following: Did you tell the government that you told Jane that cooperating with the government and testifying in this case would help her civil case against Epstein's estate and Ms. Maxwell and/or her claim to the victims' compensation fund? The question does not elicit privileged information directly because it seeks only to know what Mr. Glassman told the government. Unlike the other proffers, this testimony is relevant because Mr. Glassman's testimony, if the answer is yes, could contradict Jane's testimony and allow an inference to the jury that at least at one point she may have been under the impression that testifying would help her civil case against Ms. Maxwell and her claim to the fund. With this SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016487",
