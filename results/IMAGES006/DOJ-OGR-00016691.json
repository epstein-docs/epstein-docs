I'm told it was not -- she testified it\n3 was not during the period of the charged conspiracy when she\n4 was on public assistance, but she did testify to it and that's\n5 now on the record, and if these records tend to counter that\n6 point, that she had made that point to the jury, I think we\n7 could use these records to show that.\n8 With the other travelers, your Honor, I think we can\n9 come to a practical solution.\n10 THE COURT: See if you can come to a solution and you\n11 can tell me where we are. We'll break for 10 minutes.\n12 (Recess)\n13 THE COURT: All right. Where are we?\n14 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we conferred with the\n15 government. We reached agreement as to redactions and other\n16 omissions from this exhibit and we're just now printing new\n17 copies of the revised exhibit. We have about half of those\n18 copies. It's coming up right now and we'll have the other half\n19 shortly in just a couple minutes.\n20 THE COURT: Okay.\n21 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I have your copy I'll hand\n22 up, and one to the government, and we'll put one, with the\n23 Court's permission, facedown in the witness box.\n24 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Pomerantz, acceptable?\n25 MS. POMERANTZ: Yes, your Honor.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016691",
