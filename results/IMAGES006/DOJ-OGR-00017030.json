It's clear, it's consistent, and it points to only one conclusion: Maxwell is guilty. So today, I want to talk to you about eight different reasons that you know Maxwell is guilty. After that, I'll discuss the charges in this case, and then I'll address some of the arguments the defense has made to you throughout this trial. So let's start with the eight reasons that you know Maxwell is guilty. The first reason that you know Maxwell knew exactly what she was doing when she recruited and groomed young girls for abuse is that Maxwell and Epstein were partners. They were partners in crime who sexually exploited young girls together. So let's talk about the relationship between Maxwell and Epstein and how it shows you that Maxwell committed these crimes together with Jeffrey Epstein. The evidence at this trial showed you that Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein's right hand. For many years they were in a romantic relationship; they were partners. In 2002, Maxwell wrote this essay; it's Government Exhibit 422. Now, you know that Maxwell wrote this essay because you saw the metadata that showed that the author of this document was G. Max, the defendant. And the document was on a computer that was registered to Maxwell. Here's that metadata. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017030",
