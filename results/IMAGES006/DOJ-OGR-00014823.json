Things happened that were so traumatizing that to this day I am unable to speak about them. I don't even have the vocabulary to describe them. In the most literal sense of the word, Epstein and Maxwell terrified me. They told me that if I told anyone, no one would believe me; and if they did, they would kill me and the people closest to me. I believed them. I was once bright, fun, outgoing and kind. I loved life and people genuinely enjoyed being around me. After meeting Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, it felt like someone shut off the lights to my soul. My secrets became too much for me to handle, and I began doing whatever I could to try to get away from Maxwell and Epstein. I changed jobs, apartments, cities and even states to try to get away. Everywhere I went, they found me. In 1997 I moved to Philadelphia with the hopes of finally starting law school. They found me again, and it was more than I could take. I was hospitalized with a nervous breakdown. It would be the first of over two dozen hospitalizations in a decade following my involvement with Epstein and Maxwell. In addition to my escalating mental health problems, I began to experience physical symptoms that doctors could never quite put their fingers on. I could no longer even pretend to be able to hold down a job or take care of myself in any SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014823",
