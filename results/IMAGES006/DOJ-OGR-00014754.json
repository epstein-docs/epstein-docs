So I believe the first -- what I see as your first continued objection is to paragraph 22. MR. EVERDELL: I'm just getting my submissions. Yes, that's correct, your Honor. THE COURT: I overrule the objection. I do credit Juan Alessi's testimony that the defendant identified and targeted Virginia after seeing her in the Mar-a-Lago parking lot. The defendant also worked with Epstein to identify and target Jane. Paragraph three I see three objections to this paragraph. Is that a continuing objection, Mr. Everdell? MR. EVERDELL: Paragraph three, your Honor? THE COURT: 23. I apologize. MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: I overrule the objection. The first objection is regarding the conclusion that Ms. Maxwell was the author of the essay in the paragraph. I overrule the objection because a reasonable inference supported by the trial evidence is that the defendant authored the essay. Metadata indicated that the computer was registered to \"GMax\" and the document was saved under the user name \"Ghislaine.\" The second objection is to the assertion that Epstein transferred Ms. Maxwell approximately $23 million during the conspiracy. I overrule that objection. Bank statements SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014754",
