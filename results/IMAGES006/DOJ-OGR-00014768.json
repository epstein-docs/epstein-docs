EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: We'll do a little back-and-forth so I have everybody's arguments in mind. Thank you.\nGo ahead, Ms. Moe.\nMS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.\nThe government is confident the 2004 Manual applies in this case. I believe we did engage with the ex post facto issue thoroughly in our brief. The question is whether the factual record at trial establishes that the offense continued throughout the duration of 2004, which it emphatically did.\nThe testimony of a crime victim who testified at this trial establishes that the offense conduct went past November 1, 2004.\nTHE COURT: So I think the framing of the question here is very important and its technical -- this whole discussion is very technical. It seems to me the question is can the government point to a preponderance of the evidence that conspiratorial conduct took place in this very small time window, basically November and December 2004. That is what's in issue, and the question is what the trial record establishes with respect to that two-month window.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00014768",
