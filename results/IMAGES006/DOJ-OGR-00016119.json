MODE:  Thank you, your Honor.\n2\n3    The second issue is with respect to the issue of\n4    having a screen that the witness sees, but which the government\n5    can't see, I think the Court noted there is an issue with the\n6    government not being able to follow what the witness is being\n7    shown.\n8        Our concern in particular is that in a letter defense\n9    counsel filed, I think they previewed that they plan to sort of\n10   highlight some portions of the documents or flag certain\n11   portions on the screen.  That is very difficult for us to\n12   follow without a mirrored screen.  And so because we cannot\n13   mirror the screens because they are open to the gallery, that\n14   is why we proposed using paper for exhibits like that, and so\n15   we ask to proceed that way.\n16       THE COURT:  Here's my thinking:  Let's say they show\n17   the paper and then they say, Okay, paragraph 2, read the first\n18   sentence.  If they want to highlight or make larger that first\n19   sentence to ease the reading of it for the witness, if they've\n20   described fully what they're doing on the screen, and I'm\n21   watching it, I think that's okay and it is not that different\n22   than doing it orally and with paper.  And I would, of course,\n23   allow the same for the government, to the extent that there are\n24   documents that you may have a witness look at that can't -- if\n25   they can't be projected on the counsel table because it might\n26   be identifying, I would permit that as well.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00016119",
