When you contact a professional masseuse, you don't need to call her mom or dad. Just looking at this page tells you that none of this was legitimate. These were millionaires who could hire the top massage therapists in the whole world, but Maxwell had a book with dozens of entries in a massage section that makes absolutely clear that these were not real massages by professional masseuses. In fact, this book makes clear that some of the entries were for kids. So let's talk about one of those entries. The entry here on the left is Virginia, parents. I want you to take a look at the phone number, ladies and gentlemen. You've seen it somewhere else at this trial, and here it is. This is Government Exhibit 823. It's the employment record for Sky Roberts. You saw Virginia Roberts' birth certificate, so you know that Sky Roberts is Virginia's dad. He was an employee at Mar-a-Lago, which, as Juan Alessi testified, is the place where Maxwell met Virginia Roberts. Take a look at the phone number listed for Sky Roberts on this document. It's the same number on Government Exhibit 52-G, the contact book. And Virginia is also, by the way, on flight records with Maxwell when she was 17 years old. Let's take a look, and as we do, you're going to see the initials \"G.M.\" for Ghislaine Maxwell on every single one. Here's the first one. Two flights, JE, GM, ET, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
