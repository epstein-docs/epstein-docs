What is it in your file that forms the basis of your opinion? 3 A. There's nothing in my file that forms the basis of my 4 opinion. What's in my file are, for example, the motion for 5 today's hearing, a copy of the disclosure for some of the 6 witnesses, a redacted copy of those sorts of things, but 7 nothing from which I'm basing my opinion on today. 8 9 Q. OK. You mentioned a contract. You're billing the 10 government at a rate of $450 an hour. Is that correct? 11 A. That is correct. 12 Q. And your initial government contract is from $45,000. Is 13 that right? 14 A. Up to $45,000. 15 Q. And how much have you been paid up to today? 16 A. Nothing. 17 Q. And so you need to complete your contract before you 18 receive your $45,000; is that right? 19 A. No. That's not my understanding. I need to prepare an 20 invoice and provide it to the government. And I haven't had a 21 chance to do that yet. 22 Q. OK. And do you know what your final invoice will look like 23 in terms of hours spent up till today? 24 A. I don't at this point, no. 25 Q. How many hours have you spent up till today? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00014975",
