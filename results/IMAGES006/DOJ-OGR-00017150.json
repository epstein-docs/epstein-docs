And she had lawyers who helped her\n4 answer those questions. And again, she didn't say anything\n5 about Ghislaine Maxwell. And then she even updated her answers\n6 again. So she's looking at her answers to make sure that they\n7 are accurate. And once again, she does not mention anything\n8 about Maxwell.\n\n9 She had a third opportunity to talk about who was\n10 involved in this operation at the Epstein home. She gave a\n11 deposition. And the deposition went on for hours. And she was\n12 asked in that deposition, Are all of the things in your civil\n13 complaint accurate? Do they include everything? Are they\n14 complete? Are they true?\n\n15 And she said, Yes, they are.\n\n16 Not one mention of Ghislaine Maxwell in hours of\n17 deposition testimony back in 2009. She may have mentioned that\n18 Maxwell answered the phone once. But guess what? The\n19 government grabbed all of those message pads which they talked\n20 to you about, and there are message pads and there are message\n21 pads, and you will get all these message pads back in the jury\n22 deliberation room. And you will see there's not one single\n23 message for Ghislaine Maxwell having to do with Carolyn. She's\n24 calling for Epstein.\n\n25 And look at the name on GX-2T in the upper right-hand\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00017150",
