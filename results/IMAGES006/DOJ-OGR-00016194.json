The only time that he\n3 would take the airlines was when the Concorde was flying. And\n4 typically, he would take a Concorde from New York to Paris, but\n5 otherwise anytime else, it was mostly private.\n6 Q. How about Ms. Maxwell, during that same period, to your\n7 knowledge, did she only fly on Mr. Epstein's private planes?\n8 A. She flew on the private planes. And if memory serves, she\n9 did ride the airlines, as well. And then, it was probably in\n10 the late 1990s, she also had an option on a quarter share or a\n11 private -- or a quarter ownership of a private jet, as well.\n12 They call it a quarter share.\n13 Q. What did Ms. Maxwell tell you about that?\n14 A. That it was her jet, which, in fact, it was, because she\n15 was partial owner of the jet and she had access to it with\n16 notice.\n17 Q. Could you explain the difference between flying on a\n18 private plane and flying commercially.\n19 A. Well, the best advantage is you leave when you want.\n20 Otherwise, flying privately, security is much less. You don't\n21 have TSA, you don't have x-rays, you come and go as you please,\n22 pretty much. Some airports even let you drive your car\n23 directly onto the ramp next to the aircraft and unload. So\n24 it's a lot more freedom flying private.\n25 Q. Typically, what, if any, interactions did you have with\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016194",
