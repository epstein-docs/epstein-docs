Count One is\n10 the conspiracy, Count Two is the substantive count.\n11 The same is true for Counts Three and Four; they are\n12 the substantive and the conspiracy counts for transportation.\n13 And Five and Six are the same for sex trafficking.\n14 It's very important that you understand that certain\n15 counts relate to certain accusers. So, for example, Counts Two\n16 and Four are entirely based on Jane.
