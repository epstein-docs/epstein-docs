And that's what the scientific literature talks about, that the grooming is really a pattern of coercive control, manipulative behavior, strategies and techniques that are done to increase one's ability to coerce another. THE COURT: Thank you. MS. POMERANTZ: Dr. Rocchio, switching gears -- THE COURT: Let's actually break before we switch gears, to extend the metaphor. We'll take a ten-minute comfort break. MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor. (Recess) THE COURT: All right, Ms. Pomerantz, you may proceed. And, Dr. Rocchio, you can take your mask off. THE WITNESS: Thank you, your Honor. BY MS. POMERANTZ: Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the relationship of trust and attachment between a victim and a perpetrator impact disclosure? A. Yes. Q. How so? A. In a couple ways. First, in a relationship of trust and attachment between a victim and a perpetrator, that can and has been established to cause a great deal of confusion on the part of the victim about what is and is not abusive.
