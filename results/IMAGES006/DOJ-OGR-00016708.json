In your work you refer to that as inbound travel, right? A. Yes. Q. Based on your review of CBP records and your experience as a CBP officer, if someone was traveling into the United States before September 11th, 2001, would CBP records necessarily reflect that person's travel into the United States? A. Not necessarily. Q. Can you explain why? A. Once again, the recordkeeping and the way that the airlines used to basically operate, I'll go back to APIS, Advance Passenger Information System. Prior to 9/11, it was voluntary for airlines to submit their manifests to APIS. After 9/11 and, more specifically, the most recent update that I'm aware of in, I believe it's 2005, mandated airlines to submit full and complete manifests to CBP using the APIS system. Q. I want to talk about when someone leaves the United States and travels internationally. In your work, you refer to that as outbound travel, right? A. Yes. Q. Based on your review of CBP records and your experience as a CBP officer, if someone was traveling out of the United States before September 11th, would CBP records necessarily reflect that person's travel out of the United States?
