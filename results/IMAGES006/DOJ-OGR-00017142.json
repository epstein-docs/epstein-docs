Well, that's kind of silly.\n3 But if you look at Jane's records that come in the same exhibit number, you'll see that they go back to January of '96. So the records go back that far. There just isn't a record of Annie going to Thailand in 1996. And so the government didn't bring you the Customs and Border Patrol records.\n9 And finally, I want to consider one other piece about Annie's story. She's saying that she wore -- she was bought these boots by the people who sexually abused her; Epstein bought her these boots. And she said that she kept them in the closet, and then the government didn't ask for them in 2006, excuse me. And you'll have the boots with you back in the jury room, and you can see for yourselves how worn those boots are.\n16 And so when the government finally got those boots in June of 2021, even though they'd met with her repeatedly, and she never told them anything about wearing these boots, she just said they bought her these boots, and then when they finally got them and looked at them and saw that she's been wearing boots from the people that she says sexually abused her, she came up with a new story, and that story was that she resided to reclaim the boots. And that's the story she told for the first time right before trial and what she told you on the stand.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00017142",
