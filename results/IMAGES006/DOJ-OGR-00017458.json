EVERDELL: Your Honor, I have the copies. What I need to do is insert them into the folders. MS. COMEY: No objection, your Honor. THE COURT: Go ahead, Mr. Everdell. (Pause) Are you ready, Mr. Everdell? MR. EVERDELL: Yes. THE COURT: The procedure will be you will direct the jury to open the folder under the chair and turn to a particular page? MR. EVERDELL: Yes. This one will be done on paper, your Honor. We'll have it on the screen for the Court, the deputy, and the witness, but the jurors will just have it in paper, as will the government, and it will not be displayed to the public. THE COURT: This is choreography to maintain the anonymity of the witnesses who might be permitted to testify under pseudonyms? MS. COMEY: That's exactly right, your Honor. And for that reason, we're going to ask that the two exhibits that the defense is about to offer be offered under seal. THE COURT: I am grateful to both counsel for working that through. Thank you.
