PAGLIUCA: No, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Ms. Moe?\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. We would like to make an application, if possible, could we do so when we return from the break? I just want to confer with my colleagues on the particulars of our application with respect to the defense summation. We wanted to look at the transcript in particular.\nTHE COURT: Well, why don't you raise it and then we'll take a short break?\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. There were a number of points during defense counsel's summations where they referred to facts which are not in evidence and testified to things which are not in evidence. And for that reason, we would respectfully request that the Court give a curative instruction, essentially in reminding the jurors that it's their recollection of the evidence that controls and not what the lawyers say.\nI think, in particular, there is one example, I believe Ms. Menninger read into the record an email from Kate which the Court expressly precluded and which is not in evidence.\nTHE COURT: What exhibit?\nMS.
