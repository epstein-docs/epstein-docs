You are going to see, based on the evidence and, importantly, the lack of evidence, that they do not support the charges in this indictment, certainly not beyond a reasonable doubt.

He had the money and the means to create an exceptional world: Beautiful homes, beautiful surroundings, beautiful people. But he also was a mysterious man without attachment. He had no wife, he had no children, he had no boss; yet he attracted all these rich, powerful, famous people before and after his fall from grace back in around 2008. In many regards, he was like a 21st century James Bond. His mystery has stirred interest and his accusers have shaken the money tree and millions of dollars have fallen their way.\n3 But Epstein wasn't the only one who manipulated, even though he was a man who, as I said, compartmentalized, had eccentricities, very specific requirements about his diet, his daily physical regime, he demanded perfection, he demanded solitude and silence; but he also surrounded himself with people and traveled at times with an entourage. Yet as open as that may seem, he kept parts of his life locked from others.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016162",
