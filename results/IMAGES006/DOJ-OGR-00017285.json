THE COURT: I don't think it is, remembering fondly when I said \"period.\" MR. PAGLIUCA: I understand, your Honor. THE COURT: \"We would like the FBI deposition 3505-005 referred to by the defense during the cross-examination of Carolyn.\" MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I don't see how Agent Richards' testimony is in any way responsive to that note. I think the response that the Court already gave is fully responsive. THE COURT: It is. MR. PAGLIUCA: My request stands, your Honor, we add Special Agent Jason Richards to that. THE COURT: Understood. Overruled. Because it's not what they've asked for. But we can be prepared, should they follow up with that request. MR. PAGLIUCA: We have the transcript here, your Honor. THE COURT: I am reading the notes verbatim, but I will work on redacting the foreperson's name so they can be made public. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017285",
