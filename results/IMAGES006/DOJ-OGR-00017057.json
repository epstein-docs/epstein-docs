  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 36 of 257 2869 LCKCmax3 Summation - Ms. Moe by herself to New Mexico to stay with Maxwell and Epstein. She thought it had to do with a potential scholarship, and so did her mother, who took the witness stand and told you that she remembered Annie going on this trip with Maxwell and Epstein, and that she thought it was a trip for multiple scholarship students who would be chaperoned by Ghislaine Maxwell. But when Annie got to New Mexico, she was alone. She was alone with Epstein and Maxwell. She was alone with them, with no chaperone, no other students. She was alone with two sexual predators. Over the course of the weekend, Maxwell engaged in textbook grooming behavior with Annie. First, Maxwell starting chatting her up, asking her about her life. She was charming her. Then Maxwell took Annie on a shopping trip. They bought her boots and Maxwell picked out a hair product for Annie. What came next? Maxwell and Epstein took Annie to a movie theater where Epstein began holding Annie's hand and rubbing her foot and her arm. He was doing the same thing he had done in New York, but now he was doing it openly. He was doing it openly because this time he was doing it with Maxwell, and he didn't have to hide it from Maxwell because she was in on the whole thing. So what did Annie tell you about next? Well, Maxwell started rationing things up to the next level. Here's her testimony about that. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017057",
