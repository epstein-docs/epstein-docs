That bar is surmounted very easily by just the testimony of Jane alone, and I have not even discussed other corroborating testimony that would support that conclusion. THE COURT: All right. Thank you. Any final points, Mr. Everdell? MR. EVERDELL: Just two, your Honor. THE COURT: Microphone, please. MR. EVERDELL: I can do it from here. THE COURT: That's fine. MR. EVERDELL: The point about Mr. Epstein's actions I won't leave alone; but, of course, only applies to the conspiracy count. Obviously Count Two is the substantive count. THE COURT: You'll address aiding and abetting? MR. EVERDELL: Well, yes, aiding and abetting. So I don't see any testimony of Ghislaine Maxwell aiding and abetting Jeffrey Epstein, enticing her to travel to New York. There's remarkably little testimony about that action, and that is what the subject of the substantive count is, right. You have to show that Ms. Maxwell enticed Jane to travel to New York with the intent knowing that when she got there, that statute, that New York statute that's cited in the indictment, would be violated.
