Q. Were the guest bedrooms next to each other or how were they set up? A. There was a bedroom with a bathroom in between. They weren't a Jack and Jill bathroom, but it was still a bedroom, a bathroom in between, and then the other bedroom, but they were on the right side of the trailer. The left side of the trailer was the master bedroom. So it was a split floor plan. Q. But you didn't sleep there; right? A. On occasion I have slept there. Q. Where did you sleep, in one of the guestrooms? A. In one of the guestrooms, but this was a vacation where Mr. Epstein was on the ranch. It was before I built my home, so I was able to spend the time at the lodge. We're going really back far. Q. But eventually, and I think maybe it was in the 2000s or so, Epstein gave you some land; is that right? A. That's correct. Q. Epstein gave you about 40 acres of land from his ranch so that you could build a house; isn't that right? A. That's correct. Q. And he didn't charge you for that land? A. No, he did not.
