She's not produced today, she's not produced Monday, then what? MS. MENNINGER: I think, your Honor, our intent would be if she's not produced by Monday morning, then, you know, we don't have time. But given that it's 1:30 and there is a lunch break, so that's 2:30, it's two and a half hours with a break in there of continuance for purposes of trying to get the witness's appearance. THE COURT: I'll look at the materials. Anything else? MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: Anything else MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: It will be a long break for the jury, but we'll resume in 45. Okay? MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, if we had time to work on these stipulations, an hour might make sense, but only if the government's available to meet. THE COURT: I'll give you an hour. It just means the jury is sitting there for an hour and a half at this point. All right. I'll meet with you in an hour, 2:30. I'm sorry. One more thing. Ms. Sternheim, when we return from lunch, I would intend to allocute Ms. Maxwell on SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016895",
