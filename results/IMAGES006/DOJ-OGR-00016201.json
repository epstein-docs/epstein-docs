During that same period between 1994 and 2004, who do you\n6 remember that you saw driving passengers up to Mr. Epstein's\n7 plane in Palm Beach?\n8 A. There were probably several.

One name comes to mind would be Juan Alessi, and\n11 another would have been one of the house managers, Janusz.\n12 There were probably a couple more that I'm just drawing a blank\n13 on their names right now.\n14 Q. That's fine. Now switching gears to New York, about when\n15 do you remember first visiting Mr. Epstein's New York\n16 residence?\n17 A. Well, he first had a home on 69th Street, so it was in 1991\n18 that I went to his very first residence, and then it was\n19 probably a year or maybe two years later on that he had\n20 purchased a different townhouse or brownstone, they call it, I\n21 guess, on 71st Street. So it was immediately with my\n22 employment I visited the home.\n23 Q. Thank you. I'd like to go back to something you said\n24 earlier about the Palm Beach airport.
