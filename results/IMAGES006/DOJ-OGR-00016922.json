I'm going to let you go for the weekend and the day given where we are in the trial. I want to just take a couple moments to really emphasize how important it is, of course, that you continue to follow all of my instructions. Even though we're at this different phase of the case, no communications with each other or anyone else through any means about the case. No consuming any information about the case through any means. Continue to keep an open mind until you hear the summation -- the closing arguments of the parties, my instructions as to the law, and you begin your deliberations as a jury. It's vitally important that those rules continue to be followed all the way through. I'm very grateful for your patience today and throughout. I wish you a very good and safe weekend. Please be cautious out there. I want to see everybody back here Monday at 9:00. And I hope you have a wonderful weekend. Thank you. (Continued on next page) SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
