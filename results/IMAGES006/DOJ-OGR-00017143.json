Where was Annie Farmer's sister? Where were the people at the ranch? Where was the chef? Where's the rest of her diaries?\nWhat you got was a photograph of the front and back of a diary, and you got photographs of several of the pages from the diary. What you didn't get was the rest of the diary. You don't even get to take the diary back into the room with you. And she told you that she had diaries from Thailand. Why didn't she share those diaries? Why didn't she give this diary to the government?\nAlso, Ms. Farmer is the one who explained a lot of the intersection of these lawyers and the witnesses. She told you she first met with the Boies Schiller firm when they were representing Virginia Roberts, and she was going to be a witness. And then she hired them. And she told you that Jane, who told you she had talked to Kate's lawyers, Brad Edwards -- and Brad Edwards was here in the courtroom when Kate was testifying, Jane talked to him as well. And then Jack Scarola, who represents Carolyn, and brought her to the government, he also talked to the same other witnesses, and they all talked to their family members and saw the media.
