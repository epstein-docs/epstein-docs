Now, after the acquisition stage, is anything that happens after the event, whichever constitutes the event occurs, considered retention stage? A. Typically, yes It's after the event is over, so we say, well, that's the retention stage. I don't mean to complicate things too much, but I think you can appreciate that actually there can be many acts of retrieval. So there can be a long retention interval peppered with different acts of retrieval. But I used a simple diagram here to illustrate the three major stages. Q. Can you simply identify what separate acts of retrieval would be. A. So after some event, say, you know, a robbery, sometimes people might have a conversation with each other about what they saw and then sometimes the police might come to the scene and start asking questions about what did you see or what did you hear, and then the person might go to a police station and maybe try to make an identification of somebody who might have been seen at the event, and then somebody may be interviewed many more times, may then testify at trial. That would be a standard situation in a legally relevant event. Q. Now, in each of those retrieval examples you just gave, that is coming from an external source; correct?
