In determining what evidence you accept, you must make your own evaluation from the testimony of each of the witnesses and the exhibits that are received in evidence. It is essential, however, that you keep an open mind until you've heard all of the evidence in the case. A case can be presented only step by step, witness by witness, before all evidence is before you.\n\nAs you know from your experience, you can hear one person give his or her version of an event and think it sounds very impressive or even compelling; and yet, upon hearing another person's version of the same event or even the same person cross-examined with respect to the event, things may seem very different. In other words, there may be another side to any witness's story.\n\nYou should use your common sense and good judgment to evaluate each witness's testimony based on all of the circumstances. Again, I can't emphasize too strongly that you must keep an open mind until the trial is over.
