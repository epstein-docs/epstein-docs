It\n2 was certainly in dispute at the time you moved. So we'll see\n3 what was moved and go from there.\n4 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.\n5 THE COURT: I have the parties proposed limiting\n6 instruction, which looks just right to me. So thank you.\n7 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. And aside from this\n8 matter, there are no additional matters this morning.\n9 MS. MENNINGER: I was going to propose that your Honor\n10 handle the limiting instruction for Ms. Farmer's testimony in\n11 the same way that we handled it for Kate in that she would be\n12 brought into the witness stand and the Court would read that\n13 limiting instruction so the jury can identify the person about\n14 who the limiting instruction is being given.\n15 THE COURT: I think we indicated yesterday before the\n16 break that we would do it the same way.\n17 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n18 MR. PAGLIUCA: There is another issue, your Honor, to\n19 a newly disclosed witness as of last night or yesterday\n20 evening. The witness's name is William Brown, as I understand\n21 it. He is, I would say, record custodian for DMV related to\n22 the identity of an individual that has the same name.\n23 THE COURT: Same first name?\n24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct.\n25 THE COURT: As Jane?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016221",
