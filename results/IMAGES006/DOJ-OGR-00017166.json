But you will have her CV and you can look at her eminent qualifications and all of her research on how people can develop memories of things that didn't happen or remember things differently from the way they actually were and how people can develop false memories.\n\nAnd what she told you is that memory is malleable. Memory weakens over time. And memory can be impacted and corrupted by post-event contamination. She talked about times when false memories can be planted in a person's mind, and that the person could then become just as emotional about these created memories as other individuals who truly had the experiences. And contrary to what most people think, memory doesn't work like a recording device; you can't just push play and it all comes back later.\n\nMemories can be impacted by post-event information that comes from all different sources. Interviews that use words that are suggestive. You'll recall that she talked about the study where they used the word \"smashed.\" How fast was the car going when it smashed into the other car; and that people gave much higher rates of speed when they heard that word, because it was suggested to them that it was fast.\n\nAnd then think back about how none of the interviews of these accusers were recorded and we don't have transcripts and we don't know the words that were used in those interviews.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00017166",
