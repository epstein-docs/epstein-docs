Epstein & Company, Inc.\nThe Villard House\n457 Madison Avenue\nNew York, NY 10022\n\nDear Ghislaine:\n\nEnclosed is the envelope we recently found in cleaning the Epstein Lodge. Apparently it lodged between the wall and the dresser. It was not discovered until the unit was moved for cleaning.\n\nAs we discussed, the final week of Camp is August 14 through the 20th. I have reserved the lodge for Jeffrey's use. In addition, he has one more week that he can reserve for himself or guests he may wish to have use it. Attached is a list of the dry goods that are in storage as part of Jeffrey's personal inventory. Please advise if we are missing any items you are aware of being sent here.\n\nPlease convey to Jeffrey how pleased we are to have such a facility on our campus. In fact, the President Elect will be staying in the lodge until his family's furniture arrives. It is a remarkable place. We are grateful.\n\nBest wishes for a wonderful holiday season.\n\nSincerely,\nTimothy J.
