It looks like outbound flights, O's in that column don't have any site information typically. Why is that?\n2 A. Because CBP, we don't have a 100 percent outbound mandate, if you will.\n3 Q. So you need to track incoming flights, people coming into the United States, but not necessarily people leaving the United States?\n4 A. I wouldn't say track. I would say when you come into the United States, you are required to be processed or admitted into the country. When you depart the country, there is no -- for example, at JFK, there is no FIS, or federal inspection site with actual CBP officers that are processing you when you go to get on board your outbound flight.\n5 Q. Understood. So I just want to take a look at the years that's reflected in this report. If you look at the first page, which are the records of Jane's travel; right?\n6 A. Yes.\n7 Q. You see the earliest one there is January 6th, 1996; right?\n8 A. Yes.\n9 Q. And the latest one there is July 25th, 2004; right?\n10 A. Correct. Yes.\n11 Q. Now, when you originally did this search, I think you said you searched all the way up to 2010; correct?\n12 A. Yes.\n13 Q. And were there records going that late, do you recall?\n14 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n15 DOJ-OGR-00016700",
