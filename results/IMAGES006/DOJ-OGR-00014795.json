As explained, I will use the 2003 Guidelines manual. Following Section 2G1.1(d)(1), each victim is considered a separate count of conviction. In addition to the three victims for which an offense level was calculated in the PSR -- Jane, Annie, and Carolyn -- I calculate offense levels, for Virginia and Melissa, coming to a total of 5 groups.\n\nFor all groups, the base offense level is 19. That's Sections 2G1.1(a) and 2X1.1(a).\n\nFor Jane and Carolyn, because they were older than 12 but were not yet 16 when abuse began, the offense level is enhanced by 2. 2G1.1(b)(2)(B).\n\nThe offense level for Jane and Carolyn is further enhanced by 2 because they were unduly influenced into a commercial sex act. 2G1.1(b)(4)(B).\n\nFor Annie, Virginia, and Melissa, who were at least 16, the offense level is increased by 2 because they were unduly influenced into a commercial act. 2G1.1.(b)(4)(B).\n\nThe offense level for all groups are also enhanced by 4 points because of the supervisory role in an extensive criminal activity. 3B1.1(a).\n\nThis brings the total offense level for Jane's and Carolyn's groups to 27. And Annie's, Virginia's and Melissa's groups each to 25.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300    DOJ-OGR-00014795",
