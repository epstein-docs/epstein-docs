You must base your verdict solely on the evidence or lack of evidence and these instructions as to the law, and you're obliged under your oath as jurors to follow the law as I've instructed you, whether you agree or disagree with the particular law in question. Under your oath as jurors, you're not to be swayed by sympathy. You should be guided solely by the evidence presented during the trial and the law as I gave it to you without regard to the consequences of your decision. You have been chosen to try the issues of fact and reach a verdict on the basis of the evidence or lack of evidence. If you let sympathy interfere with your clear thinking, there is a risk that you'll not arrive at a just verdict. As you deliberate, please listen to the opinions of your fellow jurors and ask for an opportunity to express your own views. Every juror should be heard, no one juror should hold center stage in the jury room, and no one juror should control or monopolize the deliberations. If, after listening to your fellow jurors, and if, after stating your own view, you become convinced that your view is wrong, do not hesitate because of stubbornness or pride to change your view. On the other hand, do not surrender your honest convictions and beliefs solely because of the opinions of your fellow jurors or because you are outnumbered. Your final vote must reflect your SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017269",
