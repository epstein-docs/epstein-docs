There's no enticement as would be illegal\n6    under the statute there because this is a return trip.\n7\n8    As to the first, simply traveling with someone is not\n9    enticing; that's just being present on the plane, that's not\n10   causing an effect, that's being present. That does not\n11   qualify. So simply being on the plane traveling does not\n12   establish persuasion, inducement, or enticement.\n13      And as to the last, occasionally arranging travel, if\n14   that is to be believed, is not enticement either. Jane's\n15   testimony, if you look at those transcript cites, your Honor,\n16   is that her travel arrangements were typically made by Jeffrey\n17   Epstein's office, and that Ghislaine Maxwell occasionally\n18   helped out.\n19      There is no testimony whatsoever that Ghislaine\n20   Maxwell encouraged her to travel. There is no testimony that\n21   she tried to convince her to travel anywhere, much less New\n22   York, or advised her to travel. We don't even have testimony\n23   that Ghislaine Maxwell offered to arrange the travel.\n24      All it says is that she occasionally arranged.
