In total approximately how many acres was Mr. Epstein's ranch?\n3 A. It was approximately 10,000 acres. I know there was some state land included in it, but everybody said it was around 10,000 acres.\n4 Q. And all of the structures you just described, were they all located on that property owned by Mr. Epstein?\n5 A. Yes.\n6 Q. Have you been inside the main house on the ranch property?\n7 A. Yes, I have.\n8 Q. For what purpose?\n9 A. Several purposes. A lot of the times -- it was on occasion I would meet with Mr. Epstein and discuss future aircraft maintenance or purchases for the aircraft. And then other times would be to pick up and drop off luggage. And that was another residence that I installed a lot of the home theater and audio equipment. He was an audiophile, so he liked very high-quality music; so I installed a home theater, like I had done at the other properties as well.\n10 MS. COMEY: Ms. Drescher, can we please pull up Government Exhibits 323 and 706 for the witness, the Court, and the parties.\n11 Q. Mr. Visoski, do you recognize these?\n12 A. Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017381",
