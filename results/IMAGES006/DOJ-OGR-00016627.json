Sustained. 2 MR. PAGLIUCA: The next one that's on the chart, your Honor, is not at issue. 3 THE COURT: Okay. 4 MR. PAGLIUCA: So I think that resolves it with the Court's rulings. We're down to the two that have been agreed to. 5 THE COURT: Okay. So that gets us what we need for now and you'll keep working with respect to the other two witnesses; correct? 6 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. 7 THE COURT: Great. What else? 8 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't know if the Court -- well, the Court does not need to address this, but I conferred briefly with the government about the government's proposed rebuttal expert. I'm prepared to file something related to that, but they may not be calling the rebuttal expert, so we'll deal with that later. 9 THE COURT: Let's do what we need to do in the immediate and then it sounds like we could do that by written submission if we need to. 10 So the Hamilton issue, I'm trying to get my head around. So let me just ask, make sure I understand. I'm looking at the affidavit of Mr. Hamilton. This is you, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016627",
