Again, I overrule\n6 the objection. The trial record including message pads, phone\n7 book entries, and testimony of witnesses establishes by a\n8 preponderance that the information contained in this paragraph\n9 is accurate.\n10 Paragraph 83, so there was a revision here. I'm not\n11 sure if there is a continuing objection, Mr. Everdell. The\n12 previous objection was to the assertion that the defendant is\n13 responsible for the victimization of untold number of other\n14 victims. The probation department adopted the government's\n15 suggestion, revised the paragraph to assert that the defendant\n16 is responsible for the victimization of additional minor\n17 victims. To the extent there is a continuing objection, I\n18 overrule it for the reasons stated regarding paragraphs 27 and\n19 28.\n20 Paragraph 85 is an objection to the inclusion of\n21 Kate's victim impact statement and her status under the CVRA.\n22 We have litigated the question of Kate's ability to make a\n23 statement here. I believe that defense's ultimate position was\n24 that with the requested redactions, there were no objections to\n25 her making a statement. Do I have that right?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00014763",
