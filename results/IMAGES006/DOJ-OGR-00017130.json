This isn't some Eva that the government's now gone back and scrambled and found a name in an address book. The next group of people she talks about is Emmy. She remembers Emmy was British and she was in the group sexualized massages, and there was a woman named Michelle. And now the government wants to suggest that Michelle is some random Michelle and we don't know who Michelle is, and Michelle could be any old Michelle, and look at this address book with Michelle's name. There is Michelles everywhere. But Jane told you from the stand it wasn't just any old Michelle, it's the Michelle that she hung out with her and Emmy. So it's Emmy's friend, Michelle, and she said it was Emmy's friend, Michelle, that she hung out with. And you heard Michelle on the stand say that's the Michelle, I'm the Michelle that hung out with Emmy. I don't know any other Michelles that Emmy hung out with. And no, we weren't involved in any group sexualized massages. I'm a housewife. What you see here is a pattern, you see a pattern of Jane picking names out of people she knew she met in Epstein's world at some point in time. The receptionist, the first person you see when you come into his office, and she came in there with her mom. That's the one now she remembers she was in a group sexualized massage with or a person she saw in the flight log. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017130",
