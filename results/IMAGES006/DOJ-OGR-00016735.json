All I have is a letter from the lawyers saying\n4 that they have a defense subpoena and their witness would\n5 invoke. If the request is that you want the witness to come\n6 and invoke formally outside the presence of the jury, we can do\n7 that. If the request is some substitution for that, confer\n8 with the government and make a proposal to the Court.\n9 Okay. What else?\n10 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I've conferred with the\n11 government a couple times on redactions. I tried that\n12 yesterday, I tried it again this morning. I don't have an\n13 answer back yet from them, but I hope we can have one soon on\n14 some of the exhibits that are outstanding. That's something\n15 else that's outstanding.\n16 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor, we've been trading\n17 views on redactions. We'll finalize them and submit them to\n18 the Court shortly.\n19 THE COURT: Yes, Ms. Sternheim?\n20 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I wanted to inform the Court,\n21 as the government is aware --\n22 THE COURT: I'm not sure your mic is on.\n23 MS. STERNHEIM: Now it is. There were technical\n24 issues with regard to providing testimony from Mr. Hamilton in\n25 England, and we viewed it to be just far too complicated.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016735",
