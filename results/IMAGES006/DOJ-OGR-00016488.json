PAGLIUCA: I just want to be clear, your Honor.\nYou're precluding testimony from Mr. Scarola and Mr. Edwards.\nTHE COURT: Yes.\nMR. PAGLIUCA: The only reason I'm asking that question is we can release them and not have them appear.\nTHE COURT: Yes, on the 401/403 grounds.\nMR. PAGLIUCA: Understood.\nAnd that may speed things up a little bit here, since we're releasing a couple of witnesses.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Thank you.\nAll right.
