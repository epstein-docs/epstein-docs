Yes, they do. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the government offers these in evidence. MR. EVERDELL: No objection. THE COURT: 344 and 345 government exhibits are admitted. You may publish. (Government's Exhibits 344, 345 received in evidence) MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor. Q. And while Ms. Drescher puts those up, I'll ask you, Mr. Visoski, what did Mr. Epstein use these -- this helicopter for? A. It was mainly to get from St. Thomas to Little St. James, rather than taking the boat ride. Q. Who do you remember flying this helicopter? A. Myself, Ms. Maxwell flew the helicopter with me, and I also had some contract pilots that were based in St. Thomas that assisted flying the helicopter as well. Q. About how many times do you remember Ms. Maxwell flying this helicopter? A. Many times. It would be hard to put a number on it. Any time -- several -- many times. It's hard to put a number on it. MS. COMEY: We can take those down. Thank you. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017398",
