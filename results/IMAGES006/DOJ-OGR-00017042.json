Here's Jane's application to Interlochen for the summer of 1994. She weighed 90 pounds and she just finished the seventh grade. There can't be any question that Jane was at Interlochen that summer. And there also cannot be any question that Maxwell was there that summer, too. Let's take a look at the flight records. They show you that on August 18th, 1994, Jeffrey Epstein flew to Traverse City, Michigan. That's where Interlochen is. And sure enough, two days later, on the 20th, Maxwell was on the flight home with him. She's right there in the flight records, \"GM.\" She's listed on it as a passenger on the plane ride home. These flight records prove to you that Maxwell was there that summer. That's when she met Jane. That's how it all started. You also know that Epstein and Maxwell were there in August of 1994 because Epstein had donated a scholarship lodge. Here's the letter you saw from Interlochen; it's dated February 1994. And they are thanking Epstein for donating the money to build a scholarship lodge. Government Exhibit 745 is a photograph of that lodge. And most importantly, you know that Maxwell was at Interlochen that summer because Maxwell got a letter from Interlochen in December 1994, just months after she'd met Jane at camp. The folks at Interlochen were writing Maxwell to tell her that they found an envelope while they were cleaning the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017042",
