I anticipate that Matt will testify that Jane told him during these conversations that the money was not for free, that she had to do things that she didn't want to do, that that included massages. I also anticipate that Matt would testify that there was a woman in the room and he recalls Jane describing that a woman was present while this happened who would make her and other girls who were in the room feel comfortable while it happened.\n\nTHE COURT: Ms. Sternheim.\n\nMS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, I think it's somewhat premature since the cross examination has not been concluded yet. I am mindful of the purpose why they're calling this witness, but I think we have to wait to see what happens in cross examination. I don't understand what they're asking for right now.\n\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, defense counsel put this issue in their opening statement by challenging Jane's credibility and her memory in particular. So the foundation is in the record for a prior consistent statement to be admitted under both prongs of the rule.\n\nWith respect to the first prong of 801(d)(1)(B), it is offered to rebut an express or implied charge the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent improper influence or motive in so testifying.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
