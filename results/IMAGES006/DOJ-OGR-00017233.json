The crime of conspiracy to violate federal laws is an independent offense; it is separate and distinct from the actual violation of any specific federal laws which the law refers to as \"substantive crimes.\" 13 Indeed, you may find Ms. Maxwell guilty of conspiring to violate federal laws, even if you find that the crime which was the object of the conspiracy was never actually committed. 16 As I'll explain, the three different conspiracy counts are separate offenses, and each conspiracy alleges a different purpose, which I'll describe to you shortly. 19 Instruction No. 32. Counts One, Three, and Five. Conspiracy to violate federal law. The elements. 21 To prove the defendant guilty of the crime of conspiracy, the government must prove each of the following four elements beyond a reasonable doubt: 24 First, that two or more persons entered the unlawful agreement charged in the particular count of the indictment.
