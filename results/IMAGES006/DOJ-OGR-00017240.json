It is for you to determine whether the government has established beyond a reasonable doubt that such knowledge and intent on the part of Ms. Maxwell existed. It is important for you to know that Ms. Maxwell's participation in the conspiracy must be established by independent evidence of her own acts or statements, as well as those of the alleged coconspirators and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence. It's not necessary for government to show that Ms. Maxwell was fully informed of all the details of the conspiracy in order for you to infer knowledge on her part. To have guilty knowledge, Ms. Maxwell need not have known the full extent of the conspiracy or all of the activities of all of its participants. It's not even necessary for a defendant to know every other member of the conspiracy. In addition, the duration and extent of Ms. Maxwell's participation has no bearing on the issue of her guilt. She need not have joined the conspiracy at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress and she will be held responsible for all that was done before she joined and all that was done during the conspiracy's existence while she was a member. Each member of a conspiracy may perform separate and distinct acts and may perform them at SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017240",
