I will look at it and see what the request is.\n2\n3 The issue that you noted last night, Ms. Menninger, that you said needed to be done on Monday, what is that? There was something last night when we talked about the defense would likely finish today, you caveated that there was one small short matter that would be done on Monday, and I don't think I know what that is.\n4\n5 MS. MENNINGER: I think it's the witness from London, your Honor, that you discussed with Mr. Everdell earlier.\n6\n7 MR. EVERDELL: I believe that's what we were referring to.\n8\n9 THE COURT: I didn't realize that.\n10\n11 MR. EVERDELL: I thought I actually said, your Honor, another witness, a short witness that we might need to put on on Monday.\n12\n13 THE COURT: That's the same as what you caveated? MS. MENNINGER: Yes.\n14\n15 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes, Judge. That's when I said that we would make sure that we were finished so that we could go right into the closings.\n16\n17 MS. MOE: Your Honor, on that score, I did not realize that that was the same witness we were talking about this morning. If they were aware of this witness yesterday, that name was not on the witness list provided to the government,\n18\n19 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n20 DOJ-OGR-00016880",
