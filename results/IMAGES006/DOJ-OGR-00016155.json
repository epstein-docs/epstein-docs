It's out of the\n3 earshot of the jury.\n4 State your objection.\n5 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, this is in violation of\n6 pretrial ruling made by the Court, including the defense, from\n7 arguing that the government was targeting this defendant --\n8 THE COURT: And they may not do that. What they can\n9 do is argue that, for the witnesses, she's a scapegoat or a\n10 stand-in, and I think that's where we are in the line. I think\n11 the last statement comes closest because you put it in context\n12 of justice. The other ones, that's why I said as stated, were\n13 on the line about credibility of these witnesses and motives of\n14 witnesses and that, I think you agree, is permissible.\n15 MS. COMEY: That is permissible, your Honor. But the\n16 reference to an empty chair is clearly a reference to this case\n17 and the prosecution --\n18 THE COURT: I won't allow the line to be crossed into\n19 where I ruled on, which is that you can't talk about\n20 motivations of the prosecution. The government is not on\n21 trial.\n22 To the extent that you want to argue motivation of the\n23 witnesses to not tell the truth or credibility with respect to\n24 them, you may do that, but don't play with the line.\n25 MS. STERNHEIM: I will not. I will not play with the\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
