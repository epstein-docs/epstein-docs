The Maxwell grand jury met on June 29, 2020, July 8, 2020, and March 29, 2021.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand jury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.

As previewed in the Government's submission of July 29, 2025, many of the victims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by investigating law enforcement witnesses.

The Government, however, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand jury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to compare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell trial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the extent such dockets are publicly available.

While the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court's \"jurisdiction end[s]\" when \"a nolle prosequi [is] entered,\" Ex parte Wilson, 140 U.S. 575, 583 (1891), it did so in the context of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has explicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether to disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n\n1 Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar analysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in the Court's analysis of the In re Craig factors related to the Government's motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00015081",
