A couple of quick details about my daughter - went to see the Duchess on Valentines day, & Blue Man Group Tues off Broadway really cool I enjoyed it. Went to the fleamarket where I got a cool shirt, went to Jeffrey Epstein's Mansion, went to the Met, a pretty fun New Years Eve party, went to twist stores where I got an amazing dress for $20 it's from the fifties, lace with pink flowers & rhinestones in the middle all over it, it is my dream dress. One night we went to the movies w/ Jeffrey Epstein - it was a little weird one of those things that is weird hard to explain we were sitting next to each other & he put out his hand for me to hold & we were holding hands (not weird, normal & fine) then he kind of caressed/rubbed my arm & ankle/foot - it was one of those things that just gave me a weird feeling but wasn't that weird & probably normal - the one thing that kind of weirded me out about it was he let go of my hand when he was talking to [REDACTED] I decided it was no big deal, it just made me mad because he is being so amazing - paying for a summer program for me & helping me w/ college - he is so nice & so generous w/ everything & I just didn't want to have any weird feelings about it - I didn't/couldn't say anything.\nDOJ REDACTION\nDOJ-OGR-00015727",
