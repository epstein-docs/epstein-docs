  "full_text": "Jeffrey and Ghislaine have been together, a couple, for the last 11 years. They are, contrary to what many people think, rarely apart - I almost always see them together Ghislaine is highly intelligent, and great company with a ready smile and an infectious laugh who always puts one at ones ease, and always makes one feel welcome. Jeffrey and Ghislaine share many mutual interests and they have a lot of fun together. They both have keen searching and inquisitive minds. She grew up amongst scientists and in an academic and business environment. They share a love of travel and art. She speaks 5 languages. She enjoys spending time visiting auction houses (she says that is the best way to learn about art and antiques - your expected to look touch and ask questions) Ghislaine also has her own interests and has her own business pursuits - she is independent and strong willed - something which Jeffrey loves about her - She is adventurous - she flies helicopters, she is athletic - she rides horses, plays tennis, skis and scuba dives. She is a serious photographer (she always has a camera in hand) who is collaborating with some of the leading people involved at the cutting edge of digital photography. Jeffrey and Ghislaine compliment each other really well and I cannot imagine one without the other. On top of being great partners they are also the best of friends. GOVERNMENT EXHIBIT 422 S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) DOJ-OGR-00015679",
