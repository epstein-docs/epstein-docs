STERNHEIM: Thank you.\n5 Let's go back to Annie for just a couple of minutes.\n6 Whatever you hear Annie claim happened there, Annie did not believe that she was a victim until later. People convinced her otherwise. And interestingly, she will tell you that she stopped writing in her diary before the events she will testify to concerning New Mexico.\n7 Now, Annie is a 41-year-old psychotherapist who met Ghislaine once in Santa Fe. Never saw her again. Never saw Epstein after that. Never traveled to New York after that.\n8 She now promotes herself as a victim and speaks publicly.\n9 Now, you should wonder why she is even a part of this case. Because from our perspective, what happened in New Mexico is not illegal conduct under the terms of this indictment. She will claim that she's scarred by what happened there. Yet ask yourself, if it was so traumatic, why has she kept for 25 years the boots she claims Epstein purchased for her to wear in the snake-filled brush of Santa Fe, boots that have been well-worn over more than two decades. Now, Annie's lawyers helped to set up the fund, and she was awarded $1.5 million for whatever she claims and didn't believe was victimizing in Santa Fe.\n10 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
