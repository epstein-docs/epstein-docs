COMEY: Your Honor, I believe a note saying that that document is not in evidence would be an appropriate response.\n\nMR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I think since there was impeachment from the document -- I agree it's not a deposition, and I agree that the document is not in evidence. But there is 613 impeachment from that document. I think the Court -- and Ms. Sternheim tells me what I was about to say, which is good; we're consistent.\n\nI think something like, you know, You have the evidence and testimony relating to 3505-005. That's it. I don't think that there should be any further discussion about what is or is not in evidence.\n\nTHE COURT: How about \"all admitted exhibits are before you.\"\n\nMS.
