The government has already noticed a rebuttal case. That means that the closings would not be until Tuesday, and the charge may very well not be until Wednesday. Then we go into two days off. To put the jury in a posture where they have basically four hours to deliberate before the holiday season begins is very dangerous and that's why I'm asking the Court to consider that.\n9 THE COURT: I do understand the concern. And we'll see where we are.\n11 My admonishment is to -- what I don't want to hear is if the evidence closes on Monday, that you don't want to do your closings until the 27th. That's definitely not going to happen.\n15 MS. STERNHEIM: I am not saying that, Judge. I think we all understand what the concerns are. And we will be very judicious in our attempt to complete this timely. But that being said, there is still logistical things that, in our estimation, will push this beyond Tuesday, and then we have the situation of the holiday. But we've raised it with the Court. I think the parties are mindful and we're not doing anything to delay. We just are concerned about this jury having ample time, without any external pressures, to deliberate.\n24 MS.
