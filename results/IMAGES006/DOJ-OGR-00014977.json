Do you recall that? A. I don't specifically recall that, no, I'm sorry. Q. Is that a definition of \"child,\" someone under the age of consent? A. I would -- I would define \"child\" as someone under the age of 18. Q. Well, I'm looking at page 3 of the interview notes produced in connection with your interview on April 9, 2021.
