We just don't understand the relevance of these exhibits. MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, it's evidence that she maintained a relationship with the people in her abuser's -- alleged abuser's office. I mean if she claims that she left New York and she fled this life with Epstein and didn't want anything more to do with it, this is evidence that she was keeping contact with people in his orbit. Ms. Espinosa worked in his office and was there with him in the office every day. So it goes to show that there was a continuing relationship. She voluntarily sent these photographs to her showing that she maintained that relationship voluntarily, which I think is the opposite of what you would do if what you wanted to do was put all this behind you and not be a part of this world anymore. MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, my recollection of Jane's testimony was that she herself acknowledged that she had maintained a relationship with some of the individuals and their orbit on direct examination and in the course of her testimony. So, again, I don't understand the relevance of these photographs. THE COURT: So just to be clear, you're saying that evidence came in already that she maintained a relationship; correct?
