It could stop between floors.\n\nWhen you exit the building during a fire, close all doors as you exit to confine the fire.\n\nMake sure that everyone leaves with you.\n\nHeat, smoke and gases emitted by burning materials can quickly choke you.

Stop where you are, drop to the ground, cover your face with your hands to protect your face and lungs and roll over to smother the flames.\n\nDo not overestimate your ability to put out a fire. Most fires cannot be easily or safely extinguished. Do not attempt to put the fire out once it be gins to quickly spread.\n\nHURRICANE SEASON\n\nThe season generally runs from June through November with the peak period being in August and September.\n\nDuring this time, it is necessary to monitor all weather systems on a daily basis, either via the television, internet or radio.
