I overrule the objection.\n12 Conduct involving Kate may be considered at sentencing her\n13 testimony revealed additional details of the defendant's method\n14 of identifying and introducing to Epstein young girls for\n15 sexualized massages. Her testimony also established the\n16 defendant's knowledge of the sexualized nature of massages with\n17 Epstein.\n18 Paragraph 43, the defendant contends this paragraph\n19 should include a sentence that Kate was above the age of\n20 consent at all times. I think the paragraph says that Kate was\n21 age 17 or above at all relevant times, and I have no objection\n22 to including that she was above the age of consent at all times\n23 based on the trial evidence, so I will make that change to\n24 paragraph 43 of the PSR.\n25 Paragraph 54, the defendant objects that there's no\n26 evidence that Epstein paid for Annie's trip to Thailand.
