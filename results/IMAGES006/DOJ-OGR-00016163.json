Lawyers, media, money, have impacted the memories that you will hear about. You will learn that these four women are all represented by civil lawyers who targeted clients, primed their clients, cultivated their stories, honed their accusations. MS. COMEY: Objection. THE COURT: Just a moment. I need to hear the grounds. (At sidebar) MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. Our objection is, as the Court may recall, we moved to preclude any suggestion before this jury the credibility of lawyers was at issue in this case. In particular, as the Court might recall, last week we raised the issue that defense counsel had served subpoenas on the lawyers for these witnesses. In our view, we can't imagine how it can be proper to bring this out before this jury or how this evidence that defense counsel is proffering could possibly come in evidence at this trial. What Ms. Sternheim has just proffered is about a conversation with lawyers and their clients, which can't possibly come before this jury at this trial; it would be inappropriate.
