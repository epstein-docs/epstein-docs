That was one of their opinions at the conclusion of the article. Q. Right, which you did not agree with. Is that right? A. I, I wouldn't presume to make an opinion about -- to offer an opinion about Daubert specifically, but certainly I'm here to talk about the state of the scientific literature in my areas of expertise. Q. OK. But the most recent state of the scientific literature is Exhibit 3. Is that right? A. No. That's an example of a recent article that was done and not the most recent, nor is it the only. Q. Well, did you give any other more recent article to the government in support of your testimony here today? A. I would have to look at the dates of all of the articles I gave them. I'm not sure of the order of publication. It's possible that this was pub -- the Winters article we've been talking about was published, I believe, in 2020. So I would -- certainly there have been articles published since that time. Q. Do you know of one that does anything with the Winters study to move it forward, to validate it in any way? A. Not specifically. I would have to look for that. At the moment no. Q. OK. Thank you. Exhibit 5 -- SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00015011",
