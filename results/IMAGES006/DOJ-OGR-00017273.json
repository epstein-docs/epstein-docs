I'll bring you into the courtroom for directions. MS. STERNHEIM: Are you allowing them to set the start time or is the Court -- THE COURT: I will set it. So, assuming we don't get a verdict tonight, when they say they're ready to break, I'll bring them in and I'll direct them to resume deliberations at 9:00 a.m., that they should go straight to the jury room and begin deliberations once all 12 of them are there. Anything else? MR. PAGLIUCA: During the morning when they get here, we will be here in the courthouse, but we're not in the courtroom necessarily, and then when they break in the evening, you just let them go and we're not in the courtroom? THE COURT: Right. And to be clear, they can take the instructions back with them and then my deputy will hand one copy of the verdict form to someone as they're going in. MR. EVERDELL: Do they need to request the exhibits or does that go back automatically? THE COURT: That's automatic. So you give back to Ms. Williams to send back what you need and hopefully we've got the person -- she can show them how to technologically use it. Last point is, we'll have the marshal come forward to be sworn before they go back. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017273",
