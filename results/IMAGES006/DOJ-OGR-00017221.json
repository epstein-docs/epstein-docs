I instruct you as a matter of law that sexual abuse in the third degree -- the offense set forth in Count Two of the indictment -- was a violation of New York State Penal Law from in or about 1994, up to and including in or about 1997, at the time the acts are alleged to have been committed. A person violates New York State Penal Law Section 130.55, sexual abuse in the third degree, when he or she subjects another person to sexual contact without the latter's consent. Under New York law, \"sexual contact\" means any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party. It includes the touching of the victim by the actor, whether directly or through clothing; as well as the emission of ejaculate by the actor upon any part of the victim, clothed or unclothed. Also under New York law, lack of consent can result from incapacity to consent. A person less than 17 years old is deemed incapable of consenting to sexual contact under New York law. Thus, the law deems sexual contact with a person less than 17 years old to be without that person's consent even if, in fact, that person did consent. However, in order to find SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017221",
