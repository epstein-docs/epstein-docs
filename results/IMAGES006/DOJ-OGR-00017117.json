Let's start with Jane. The government started their opening with, this is the story of Jane, and it was just that, quite a story, like an actress who forgot her lines. She was supposed to place Ghislaine Maxwell in the middle of Epstein's sexual abuse ring, but she doesn't actually have a clear recollection of anything that Ghislaine did. Time and time again, she couldn't remember whether Maxwell ever touched her, kissed her, or even was in the room when Epstein was supposedly abusing her. When actually asked on the stand to retrieve memories of whether Ghislaine Maxwell was in the room, they had to ask her that specific question, were there times when Ghislaine was in the room when it happened. She said yes to the government's questions, but her body language said hesitation, I don't remember it, I can't remember the details. Indeed, when I asked her on the stand, as you sit here today, isn't it true that you don't remember being alone in the room with Epstein and Ghislaine, and she said, no. In February 2020, they asked her if there were times it was just her, Epstein, and Ghislaine in the room, and she said she was not sure, she doesn't recall that now. I asked her when she was talking to the government whether she ever told them that she, Ghislaine, and Jeffrey were alone in the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017117",
