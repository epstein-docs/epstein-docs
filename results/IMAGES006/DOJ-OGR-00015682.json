  "full_text": "time, I really think John and I could have a respectable draft in one to two days but getting uninterrupted time is nearly impossible! John told me last week that he feels he is doing a much better job and is focusing on details. I don't plan to speak to him until after you leave but I'm sure he'll say he is distracted with the loss of his father in law. Obviously we don't want an attitude while you're in residence!! I'd like to discuss this with you and hear how the interviews go. Remember, we also have 6-8 resumes from the NY area which I'll follow up on. Jerome does power wash the pool deck. One thing I did notice... Jerome was working on the staff house. John said Alan has a contract with Frank Steele and Jerome was not on our time. I asked John to make sure we're getting our hours... Please call anytime if you want me to take any immediate action or it you'd like to discuss this... Regards, Sally -----Original Message----- From: G.

There was no drinking water in the black Merc 2. There were no pens in the black Merc 3. The bulb on JE desk ws burnt out when we arrived 4. The pool deck was so filthy JE had to ask him to pressure wash it. Is this not the gardeners job and if so why does John not have it done 5. Even thought John sd that he changed the colour card in the computer - having done it could he not see that it was exactly the same as before ie no different and that obviously JE would not be happy w/it? 6.The massage creams etc in JE's bathroom were a mess no one had tidied up and arranged them so it was neat I am at a loss. Plse for a long as we have to work w/him there has to be a list - you need to figure out how to make sure he is doing it. How are we doing w/the PB manual - where do we stand w/it? G",
