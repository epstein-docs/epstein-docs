COMEY: Not from the government, your Honor.\n3 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor, unless you want to talk about the cross choreography.\n4\n5 THE COURT: Sure. That's a good idea.\n6 So you will have binders --\n7 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.\n8 THE COURT: -- that will be placed under the jurors' chairs.\n9\n10 MR. EVERDELL: Let me be clear, your Honor. We will have a binder for the witness; although we are going to try to use the electronics, but we'll have a binder just in case for the witness.\n11\n12 THE COURT: Right.\n13\n14 MR. EVERDELL: And we have manila folders this big, which is two documents in them, each one page, for each of the jurors. And there will come a point where I will ask the jurors to look at these; but I think, similar to what we did with the government binders, if we can leave them there and instruct the jurors not to look at them. And then when I use them, I will show copies to the government before they open them up to make sure everything is okay. And then we can have them open it up if and when the Court approves that.\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24 THE COURT: Okay.\n25 And so you'll show the paper copies to the government.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016211",
