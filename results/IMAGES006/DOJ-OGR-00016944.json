EVERDELL: First, on line 5, there's another \"or foreign,\" which we can omit.\n7\n8 THE COURT: Okay. Let me just look.\n9 Yeah. Okay.\n10 MR. ROHRBACH: It would need to be ellipses since this is the statutory text, but that's fine with the government.\n11\n12 THE COURT: So we'll do, page 19, line 5, it will read, \"Travel in interstate... commerce,\" cutting \"or foreign\" and replacing with the ellipses.\n13\n14\n15 Okay.
