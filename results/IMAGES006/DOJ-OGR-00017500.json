Now, you testified that by 2004 or so, to the best of your recollection, Ghislaine was traveling much less frequently on Epstein's planes; isn't that right? A. Yes. Q. She was moving on from Epstein, was she not? A. That's correct. Q. Isn't it true that by 2004, Ghislaine was in a committed relationship with another man? A. Yes. Q. You're familiar with Ted Waitt? A. Yes, I am. Q. He's the cofounder of Gateway Incorporated, the computer company, isn't he? A. That's correct. Q. And Ghislaine was in a relationship with Ted Waitt by 2004, wasn't she? A. I don't know if it was a relationship, but I know she was spending a lot of time with Mr. Waitt, and I think he was completing a boat that she was involved in decorating and building a helipad on it. So it was a different transfer to Mr. Weight. Q. And, in fact, I think Ghislaine introduced you to Waitt's pilots, you guys became friends? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
