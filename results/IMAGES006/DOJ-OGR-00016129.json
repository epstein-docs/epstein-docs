Second, objections to questions are not evidence. The lawyers have an obligation to make an objection when they believe evidence being offered is improper under the rules of evidence. You should not be influenced by the objection or by my rulings on them. If the objection is sustained, ignore the question and any answer that may have been given. If it's overruled, treat the answer like any other. If you're instructed that some item of evidence is received for a limited purpose only, you must follow that instruction. Third, the testimony that I've excluded or told you to disregard is not evidence and must not be considered. Fourth, anything you may have seen or heard outside the courtroom is not evidence and must be disregarded. You are to decide this case solely on the evidence presented here in the courtroom. There is no formula to evaluate testimony or exhibits. For now, suffice it to say that you bring with you into this courtroom all of the experience and background of your lives. Do not leave your common sense outside the courtroom. The same types of tests that you use in your everyday dealings are the tests that you should apply in deciding how much weight, if any, to give to the evidence in this case. The law does not require you to accept all of the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00016129",
