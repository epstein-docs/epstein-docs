MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you. Just a housekeeping matter with respect to Government Exhibit 52. We just wanted to clarify, before we offered the excerpts, that we would be offering Government Exhibit 52 and its subparts pursuant to a stipulation that they are true and accurate photocopies. I just wanted to make sure we clarified that before we offered it at the beginning of the court day.\n3 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm not sure if we're saying the same thing. I understood that 52 was being offered foundationally, which is the entire document, and that then there are the excerpts that were being offered into evidence for the jury. That was my understanding of the process that we were doing.\n4 THE COURT: Ms. Moe, it's your exhibit.\n5 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. I think the way in which we're proposing handling this would be similar in the way we handled the message pads, which is part of the authentication, involves the message pads themselves. So those exhibits were offered and also the subparts as marked exhibit --\n6 THE COURT: I think you are then saying the same thing.\n7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay. So you'll move 52 in its entirety. There is a stipulation as to the accuracy of the\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00016218",
