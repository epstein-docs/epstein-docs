MENNINGER: Your Honor, just to the extent it's\n3 why she went, it's, I understand after the conversation with\n4 the mother, I went to New Mexico. But if it's the content from\n5 the mother to her, that's where it gets into the hearsay piece.\n6 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, just to clarify, the jury just\n7 heard this witness say she felt uncomfortable around Jeffrey\n8 Epstein; and that she knew something was wrong. The point of\n9 this is not to give the truth of what the mother said, but to\n10 explain why she was willing to go back to see Jeffrey Epstein\n11 again. That is all we're trying to elicit.\n12 THE COURT: You're trying to elicit that her mother\n13 told her that Maxwell would be there, which is for the truth\n14 and hearsay. In any event, because it is central to the\n15 question coming in as hearsay, there's a 403 issue. I think\n16 you can get this -- you can get who was there, etc., but not\n17 what her mother told her for the truth, which is, I think,\n18 plainly what you're trying to do.\n19 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I can be more precise.\n20 I think the questions would be, Did you feel\n21 comfortable going to New Mexico? Why did you feel comfortable\n22 going to New Mexico? And then we wouldn't object to a limiting\n23 instruction. It's not offered for the truth, it's to explain\n24 the progress of events and why she would feel comfortable doing\n25 something like that.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
