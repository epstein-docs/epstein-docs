I will confirm with the relevant court administrative staff and the marshal that we can do that and ensure public access and the like, of course, Ms. Maxwell's presence. But, as I said, my assumption is we can do that.  So I will get you the charge sometime in advance of the 18th.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, one other matter to take up.\n\nLooking ahead to the defense case -- and we have been in contact with a number of our potential witnesses, and we are already getting requests, and I think these are valid requests -- that at least some of them testify anonymously --\n\nTHE COURT: I think your mic went out.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Maybe it's my mic that's the problem, your Honor. It's making noise.\n\nMS. STERNHEIM: Try this one.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Is that better?\n\nTHE COURT: It is.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: Okay. So, your Honor, as I was saying, we've been in contact with some of our witnesses, and we are already getting what I think are valid requests that these witnesses testify anonymously or under some sort of protection, name protection, whether that's a pseudonym or a first name, we have to work that out.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
