Please be seated.\nI did receive your note asking to finish today at 5, so I brought you in to dismiss you.\nA few things.\nOf course, bear all of my instructions in mind.\nPlease continue to take precautions in light of the increase in the variant. I need all of you here and healthy, of course. So take your masks, be cautious. I appreciate that.\nYou'll begin again tomorrow at 9 a.m. Same instructions: Wait till everyone is there, then begin your deliberations.\nIf deliberations are not complete starting tomorrow, I would like you to make yourselves available to deliberate until at least 6 p.m. Of course, if you all agree to deliberate later than that, you're most welcome to do so. Please just let me know by note when you wish to stop. But I'd like you to plan to deliberate until at least 6 p.m.\nAs with the last time, if that is a hardship that you can't do, let Ms. Williams know that on your way out and we'll adjust. But otherwise, please plan for 6 p.m. Of course, by this I don't mean to pressure you in any way. You should take all the time that you need.\nWith that, I bid you a good night.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00017332",
