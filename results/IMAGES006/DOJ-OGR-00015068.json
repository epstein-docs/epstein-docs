The Court should consider the \"continued existence and vulnerabilities of such parties.\" Id.\n\nIn this case, the grand jury testimony was offered specifically in connection with charges proposed against Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein is deceased, and no family member has approached the Government indicating an interest in the instant motions. One of Epstein's family members previously filed a request for materials pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the Government responded to that request, and no litigation ensued.
