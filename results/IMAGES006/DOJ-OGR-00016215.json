COMEY: Yes, your Honor. 5 THE COURT: And I'm not sure if we'll get -- if we'll 6 do a break -- so it sounds like the defense should put the 7 folders underneath in the morning as well, in case we get to 8 cross before the break. Is that okay with everyone? 9 MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor. 10 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor. 11 THE COURT: Okay. Great. 12 Other matters to take up in the immediate -- 13 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor. 14 MR. EVERDELL: Not from the defense. 15 THE COURT: Okay. We'll meet at 8:45 just to discuss 16 issues as we need to. Please think through issues that may 17 come up that require discussion out of the presence of the 18 jury. It was disappointing to have multiple sidebars during 19 openings today.
