Can you explain.\n4 A. So, again, I'll use an example in the civil arena. If I'm\n5 asked, as part of my forensic evaluation, to opine about the\n6 impact of an alleged event, say childhood sexual abuse, and the\n7 degree to which a person's current difficulties are related to\n8 that event, I have to take prior vulnerability into account,\n9 because part of what I'm looking at is, how can I determine\n10 which of these persons' current difficulties are related to the\n11 sexual abuse or maybe related to other things that have\n12 happened in their past. So we know, because of the\n13 vulnerability literature, that if somebody is being abused in\n14 adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to\n15 have a history of earlier childhood sexual abuse.\n16 So I have to look at the interaction of those prior\n17 vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities\n18 both may have made the individual more vulnerable to the\n19 grooming behavior and to the subsequent sexual abuse, and also\n20 ways in which those prior vulnerabilities may have interacted\n21 with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for the\n22 individual I'm evaluating.\n23 Q. How does what you have observed in your forensic practice\n24 compare to your clinical practice with respect to individuals\n25 in higher-risk groups?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
