As long as I'm able to return to this topic and display things to the jury, that's fine. MS. COMEY: That's fine with me, your Honor. THE COURT: I don't usually tell lawyers what topics -- you're not going to get an asked and answered objection, if that's -- MR. EVERDELL: Yes. Understood, your Honor. THE COURT: So we'll keep going for now. I presume we'll hit the lunch break time and then you can do the choreography. MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor. We'll do that. We're breaking for lunch when? THE COURT: We have jury lunches at 12:30. If you're otherwise done by then, we'll break early and do that. MR. EVERDELL: Let me see if I can also fix it in the meantime. THE COURT: Mr. Everdell, my deputy reminds me, we have a close room with bathrooms, we can just do a short break for the jury. MR. EVERDELL: Thank you, your Honor. THE COURT: So we'll do a five-minute break, members of the jury. Ms. Williams will take you just to that first room where the restrooms are. Thank you.
