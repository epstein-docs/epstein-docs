I think a more limited answer is something along the lines of: You have the admitted evidence relating to 3505-5. Something like that. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think it's important to clarify for the jury that the particular document they requested is not in evidence; but that they may consider what they already have in the transcript and what they already have in the exhibits. THE COURT: That sounds pretty similar. MR. PAGLIUCA: Which is what I just said without saying the document is not in evidence. Because the testimony about the document is in evidence. I don't think I'm splitting hairs here. I think the evidence is what it is. THE COURT: How about then: You have all admitted exhibits, period. Because it's directly responsive to the question without assuming further questions. MR. PAGLIUCA: I think what we're struggling with is the difference between the testimony and the specific document. I think it diminishes the testimony by inferring that somehow it's not evidence before the jury. THE COURT: They are asking for the document, I presume in part because they have the testimony in front of them. MR. PAGLIUCA: Right. Which I'm happy to give them the 35 -- SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017282",
