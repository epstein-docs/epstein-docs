And he just took my hand and he said, Follow me. 2 Q. Where did he take you? 3 A. He took me outside in the backyard past the pool to the pool house. 4 Q. Could you please describe for the jury what happened when he took you inside the pool house. 5 A. He took me in the pool house. And on the right-hand side was this couch, futon-looking thing. And he just proceeded to pull me over. And he sat in the corner and he didn't say a word. And he just pulled his pants down. He was wearing sweatpants. And he pulled me on top of himself and he proceeded to masturbate on me. And then he just -- he got up and he went into the bathroom and, like, cleaned himself up, and then acted like nothing happened. 6 Q. What was your reaction when he did that to you? 7 A. Well, I was frozen in fear. I'd never seen a penis before, let alone not seen anything like this. 8 Q. Did you tell anyone that day about what happened to you? 9 A. No. 10 Q. Why not? 11 A. Because I was terrified and felt gross and I felt ashamed. 12 Q. After the incident that you just described, did you continue spending time with Maxwell and Epstein in Palm Beach? 13 A. Yes.
