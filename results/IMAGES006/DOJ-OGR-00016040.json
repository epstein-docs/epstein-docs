Karen Sargent, a noted architect and Interlochen Alumni from New Jersey, is in the process of modifying the plans to incorporate wheel chair and handicap accessibility. She will forward the plans to me upon completion.\n\nThe basic plan for one-half of the lodge is priced in the neighborhood of $125,000 to $150,000, depending on the options selected. Karen is also working on the cost for modifying the structure. I will send them on to you upon my return from Colorado in mid-September.\n\nI have spoken with Dean Boal and our Buildings and Grounds Director. We believe the area next to Frohlich lodge is the optimal spot for placement due to its location on the water and accessibility for handicapped vehicles in the winter.\n\nIf you are interested in proceeding with the concept, I will be happy to send a formal proposal upon my return.\n\nAll is well here, but a bit muggy.\n\nBest wishes,\ntja\n\nInterlochen Arts Academy Interlochen Arts Camp Interlochen Public Radio 88.7 FM / 100.9 FM\nAddress: Interlochen Center for the Arts P.O.
