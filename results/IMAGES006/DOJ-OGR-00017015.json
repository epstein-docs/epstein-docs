I don't know if the Court has found out if any of the jurors are having issues about staying later on Monday. 3 4 5 THE COURT: They were all fine. 6 MS. STERNHEIM: OK, because I just wanted to say that we are motivated, and I think the government would join me, in having us complete all of the closing arguments and the charge on Monday. 7 8 9 10 THE COURT: Yes. I think we can do that. 11 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. 12 THE COURT: Which gets to my next to-do item, which is -- I realize we don't have the relevant people, but I think 13 14 Ms. Moe had indicated two to three hours. 15 MS.

So it's a little cumbersome, because there is more work to be done connecting up a number of 21 22 23 24 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017015",
