As noted above, the text of Rule 17(c) plainly provides that materials obtained pursuant to a subpoena may be returned to the Court which \"may permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them.\" Fed.

Nowhere does the Rule provide for one party's ability to use a subpoena to secretively gather material in advance of trial, nor does it include a categorical exception due to concerns about defense or trial strategy.
