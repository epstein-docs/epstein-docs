Of course we understand if issues arise in the interim, we will address that as it occurs, but we do think it makes sense at this juncture to set a firm trial date. We don't think that any delay in this case is in the public interest. 6 THE COURT: Counsel. 7 MR. WEINBERG: We think that the delay in bringing this charge, your Honor, the natural corollary of that is to make it more difficult, not easier, for us to defend Mr. Epstein. For instance, there are certain sealed files for potential witnesses that we would have to go to other courts to seek to unseal. There is an NPA to litigate. This case is not your ordinary 1591 case. A case of four to six weeks is not the ordinary amount of time the government takes to prosecute, whether it is old or new cases. We need 13 months. I'm trying to make a principled argument, Judge, that that would be a schedule that we would try our best to meet, conditioned on our ability to work with Mr. Epstein under the current conditions. 19 Thank you, sir. 20 THE COURT: Okay. 21 So, we are going to monitor the case from now until then anyway, so I think everybody will be in a better position to know what is realistic with respect to a trial date. I will exclude time from today through, let's say, June 8, but that, of course, is without prejudice to hearing from the defense and SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
