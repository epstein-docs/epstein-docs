The security guards will prevent Ms. Maxwell from leaving the residence at any time without prior approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and will escort her when she is authorized to leave. If the Court wishes to make private security a condition of her bond, the guards could report to Pretrial Services.1 We believe these conditions are more than sufficient to reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's presence in court.\n1 As we argued in our initial bail application, this case involves the limited circumstance under which the Second Circuit approved granting pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that she pays for private armed security guards. United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2019) (defendant who \"is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of [her] wealth . . . may be released on such a condition only where, but for [her] wealth, [s]he would not have been detained\" (emphasis in original)). Therefore, Ms. Maxwell may be released on the condition that she pay for private armed security. (Dkt. 18 at 20 n.16.)\n3\nDOJ-OGR-00001981",
