Come help me with a kink in my shoulder while we finish our discussion.\" A large vibrator and a couple of hundred dollars, disgust and dirty secret, more praise and imparted wisdom from a godlike figure, a deliberate diabolical depression of grooming and submission for his pleasure and release. Even if I resisted, I was no match for him. I felt powerless, ashamed, and embarrassed. I wanted to vomit remembering these moments. What I learned in those depraved sessions, staring up at the dome ceiling in his private massage room, tore a violent hole through any normal sexual awakening. I'm haunted forever, having learned everything there is to know about sex through a vile criminal. Every time a new molestation would bring a new lesson, the progressive and constant unwinding. I was nothing more than a teenage prostitute. I was his slave. I had never even kissed a boy before I met him, and never throughout the horrific abuse did Jeffrey Epstein kiss me even once. When he stole my virginity, he washed my entire body compulsively in the shower and then told me, \"If you're not a virgin, I will kill you.\" And then I wasn't a virgin anymore.
