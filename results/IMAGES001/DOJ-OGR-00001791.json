The Government's Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the Florida Investigation\n\nAs an initial matter, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has obtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office's case file from the Florida Investigation. The Government has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and intends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure in this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-302 of any relevant witness interview; any relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that investigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein's Palm Beach residence conducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains substantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including, if applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this case.\n\nIn total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the Florida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as follows:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (\"PBPD\") opened its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein in or about 2005. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things, conducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,4 and executed a search warrant at Epstein's Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2006, the PBPD referred its investigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government's understanding that the PBPD provided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution Team already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and will continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case. Additionally, the Government has contacted the Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed the Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already provided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, however, the Government asked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in PBPD's possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records Specialist provided the Government with 60 pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for any material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team has identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as part of its next discovery production to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State's Attorney's Office (the \"PBSA\"), working with the PBPD, among other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 2005 and 2010 (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that investigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September 14, 2020, the Prosecution Team had never received any documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA's full investigative file.\n\n4 As detailed below, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State's Attorney's Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00001791",
