In accordance with our engagement of 10 August 2020, we have prepared a summary of the financial condition of Ghislaine Maxwell based on the following information\n(i) Copies of her US tax returns filed in the years 2015 to 20201\n(ii) Documentation provided by Ghislaine Maxwell's office and her spouse including bank statements and financial correspondence relating to bank accounts, pension fund, and investments2\n(iii) Documentation provided by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York under disclosure in the criminal proceedings3\n2. We have assisted in the preparation of this statement of financial condition in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)4 on behalf of your client Ghislaine Maxwell.\n3. The information supplied by Ghislaine Maxwell's office and by her spouse is incomplete due to the limited ability to access historic banking information from some banks that have terminated their relationship either with Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse. However, we are satisfied from the review we have carried out that the absence of some contemporaneous documentary evidence does not invalidate or cast doubt on the conclusions we have reached nor on the overall reliability of the financial information as presented in the summary of the financial condition of Ghislaine Maxwell.\n4. We are not able to perform a full audit of the statement of financial condition, nor have we performed any audit type procedures, due to the current circumstances relating both to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the conditions of the detention of Ghislaine Maxwell.\n5. Accordingly, our opinion is reliant on the information provided to us, which is outlined in paragraph 1(i)-1(iii) above.\n\n1 Tax returns filed for the years 2015-2020 are attached as appendices to this report.\n2 Attached as appendices to this report.\n3 Relevant discovery materials reviewed pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order issued in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) are attached as appendices to this report.\n4 See appendices to this report\n\n3 | Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-00002064",
