Because there is no such language in the NPA here, Ms. Maxwell's position is entirely consistent with these cases, and they counsel in favor of enforcement of the NPA in this case.\nOther Second Circuit cases citing Annabi also support Ms. Maxwell's position. In United States v. Brown, No. 99-1230(L), 2002 WL 34244994 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2002), the defendants relied solely on their \"subjective beliefs\" and \"implicit understanding\" that they would not be prosecuted further in another district, which the court held irrelevant; they cited no \"affirmative appearance\" in support of their position, as Ms. Maxwell has. And in Russo, the court found it unnecessary to reach Annabi, but acknowledged that an \"affirmative appearance\" of an intent to bind other USAOs can be found even where a plea agreement does not contain an express statement to that effect—an interpretation that supports Ms. Maxwell's position that the NPA binds the government here.
