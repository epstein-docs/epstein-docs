Furthermore, on at least three occasions since she was released from quarantine, Ms. Maxwell's security team gave her the laptop to review discovery on the weekend.\n\nThere is clearly no actual impediment preventing the MDC staff from providing Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and holidays. Given the millions of documents that Ms. Maxwell must review before trial in order to prepare her defense, it is critical that she be given as much time as possible with the laptop to review the discovery.
