(USAFLS)\nFrom: Villafana, Ann Marie C. (USAFLS)\nTo: 'Jay Lefkowitz'\nSubject: Draft Agreements?\nDate: Tuesday, September 18, 2007 8:44 AM\n\nHi Jay - I was hoping there would be things for me to read this morning, but I will try to remain patient.\n\nI believe there are only two types of agreements that would apply to this case: (1) a plea agreement to a federal charge or charges; and (2) a non-prosecution agreement (which is really a deferred prosecution agreement because the defendant agrees that if he violates the agreement, the U.S. can prosecute him).\n\nA plea agreement is part of the court file. It is not accessible on-line via PACER, but someone can go to the Clerk's Office to obtain a copy.\n\nA non-prosecution agreement would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part of our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.\n\nOn the obstruction charges, many of the facts I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our discussions and the agents' observations of [REDACTED]. We will need to interview her to confirm the accuracy of those facts. On a second count, we could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein's private investigators followed [REDACTED] father, forcing him off the road. Or, if there is something more recent related to any [REDACTED] we could consider that.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA. Marie Villafaña\nAssistant U.S. Attorney\n500 S.
