Again, today is not the day to be arguing Rule 29 issues or even the construction and scope of the statute. But I think lots of the detentions are for your quintessential traffickers.\nAnd I understand we don't have consent and, therefore, the government substitutes that language. But this is not quintessential commercial sex trafficking to third parties for profit.\nBut more important or as important, if I can say that, the presumption is rebuttable. Even in those cases that your Honor listed, the statute contemplates that some 1591 defendants will be released under conditions, and I believe that the rebuttal to the presumption -- one is the danger prong; one is the flight prong.
