We were all quite proud when she graduated from Oxford with her Bachelor's degree. She, learned early on the value of hard work Around 1990, Ghislaine came to live in New York to continue Maxwell Corporate Gifts, a successful company she had founded in the UK which was subsequently absorbed in 1991, Ghislaine had to rely on her personal compass, inner resilience and sheer determination to build a fresh life for herself. Her prior 'big picture' experience, top-level entertaining skills and talent for organizing, coupled with her multi-cultural and multi-lingual sophistication, opened doors into New York society. Although it is true that for many years Ghislaine was frequently involved in high society and attended fashionable social gatherings; what irks me greatly is the press's one dimensional 'socialite' focus on Ghislaine, that completely denies and refuses to acknowledge the very serious, highly intellectual and passionate caring sides of Ghislaine. For example, since 2003, Ghislaine devoted all her energy, her own financial resources and intellectual skills to helping save the Oceans, through her establishment of the not-for-profit company, The Terramar Project. Ghislaine's deep knowledge and appreciation of the significant role the oceans play in our world's fragile ecosystem enabled her to work with key partners to influence the United Nations in 2014 in enunciating its Sustainable Development Goal 15 \"To conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.\" Indeed, it seemed so clear to me that this mission encompassed her life's passion and offered a way for her proactively to give something back of real value to society. Ghislaine showed a huge amount of courage and forbearance in the face of great adversity and in the years that followed. I have seen this strength more than ever during the times Despite the tremendous daily pressures she has been under, notably from the world's media, universally hostile to her, she has shown simultaneously a deal of humility and fortitude. She has the profoundly deep conviction (through every fibre of her being) of her innocence in the face of all the unsupported accusations and criminal charges latterly filed against her. To the best of my knowledge and belief, Ghislaine has never been brought in for questioning, arrested, or charged with any criminal offense by law enforcement until now. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the offenses with which she has been charged, as a US Citizen, she has the constitutional right to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. For the purpose of increasing their profits by boosting TV ratings and / or newspaper readership, the world's media has aired or printed the most heinous accusations against her, in some cases for years now, that have never been cross-examined in a criminal court in front of an 2 | Page DOJ-OGR-00002029",
