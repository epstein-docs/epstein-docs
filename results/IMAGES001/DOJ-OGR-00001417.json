  "full_text": "the evidence and a hearing so that we may demonstrate our other claims. These requests have been denied. In any event, the government does not even deny most of the allegations we have made - Ms. Maxwell is being kept up at night, that oftentimes the water is undrinkable, that the food is not delivered or inedible, that her computer cannot perform the necessary tasks to prepare for trial, and so on. Instead, the government simply says that the district judge is managing Ms. Maxwell's conditions. Again, that is just not true. The district court has made it clear - again in its latest order - that it won't tell BOP what to do, even though BOP has not justified in any way the treatment that Ms. Maxwell is receiving. As we have said from the start, everyone knows the real reason she is being subjected to these abusive tactics: because Jeffrey Epstein died on BOP's watch and it is going to treat Ms. Maxwell as though she is Epstein. In sentencing another woman who was held at MDC, District Judge Colleen McMahon said the defendant \"shouldn't have to suffer for the incompetence of the United States Department of Justice and its subsidiary agency, the Bureau of Prisons. I will do what I can to bring your situation to the people who, if they give a damn, might do",
