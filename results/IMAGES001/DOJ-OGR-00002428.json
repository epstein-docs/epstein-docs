  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 136 Filed 02/04/21 Page 19 of 27 Ex. K at 88-89. Ms. Maxwell was asked if she “was aware of the presence” of “sex toys” or “devices” used “in sexual activities” in Epstein’s Palm Beach house. The question was objected to for many reasons: it was compound and vague, contained numerous undefined terms, and lacked foundation. It is entirely unclear how someone may “be aware of the presence” of these, apparently, spectral objects. What exactly is a “device” used in “sexual activities?” Would bath oil, a tub, or a table qualify? What did the examiner mean by “sexual activities”? Kissing? Holding hands? The combination of toys, devices, and activities may be endless. The examiner did not limit the question to any time period and apparently charged Ms. Maxwell with discerning her level of “awareness” to the past, present and future. The true and predictable response to such a question was “No, not that I recall.” 14 DOJ-OGR-00002428",
