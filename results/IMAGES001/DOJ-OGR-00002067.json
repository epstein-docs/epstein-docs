We have reviewed available accounts and filings of Terramar Project Inc, a 501C charitable corporation in the United States, and the available accounts and filings of Terramar UK, a charity registered in the United Kingdom.

The objects of the charity are to promote for the public benefit: a) the conservation, protection and improvement of the environment, and in particular the environment of the oceans, seas, coastlines and tidal areas b) the conservation and protection of endangered marine flora and fauna c) the education of the public in the fields of marine conservation, marine ecology and related areas.\n\n21. Terramar Project Inc was founded in 2012 and Terramar UK was formed in 2014. Both organizations ceased operations in 2019 and were dissolved as corporations and charities in 2019/2020. During this period of time, Ghislaine Maxwell contributed US$560,650 to the running costs of Terramar Project and approximately $10,000 to Terramar UK.\n\n22.
