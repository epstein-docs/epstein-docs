Such a construction turns the statute's plain text - expressly providing that the presumption is \"[s]ubject to rebuttal,\" and otherwise mandating bail on the \"least restrictive\" conditions that reasonably assure the defendant's presence and community safety - on its head. It defies legislative intent. It thwarts the presumption of innocence. And it violates the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth amendment rights to due process, counsel, a defense and equal protection, not to mention the Eighth Amendment guarantee of bail - all based on a suspect if not invidious classification. To be sure, wealthy defendants do not deserve preferential treatment. But they certainly shouldn't be singled out for worse treatment - in effect, categorically disqualified from bail, at least in a presumption case - on the basis of their net worth.\n\nSecond, it bears emphasis that the presumption is hardly an insurmountable bar to release in a ยง 1591 prosecution.3 To the contrary,\n\n3 E.g., US v.
