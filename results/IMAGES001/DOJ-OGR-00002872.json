NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Court is in receipt of the Government's letter responding to its March 18, 2021 order regarding redactions to its omnibus memorandum of law in opposition to the Defendant's twelve pretrial motions.

Sept. 27, 2019).\n\nIn light of this fact and because the Court has been provided no further explanation for the request to keep this redacted, the Court ORDERS that the information contained on pages 129–134 of the Government's brief be unredacted.\n\nWith respect to the proposed redactions to pages 118-119 and Exhibit 11, the Court now understands that the parties seek redactions on the basis that the material has been maintained under seal in Giuffre v.
