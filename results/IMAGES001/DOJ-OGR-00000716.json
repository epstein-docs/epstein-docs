I had documented the events with a Texas rape crisis center about the man I know now as Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein targeted and took advantage of me, a young girl, whose mother had recently died a horrific death and whose family structure had deteriorated. His actions placed me, a young girl, into a downward spiral to the point where I purchased a gun and drove myself to an isolated place to end my suffering. A voice that could only have been from my mother told me, quote, I am not the victim, I am the victor, and I dare not pull the trigger. I returned the gun days later. Epstein is a coward. He lived his life leaching off the souls of inspiring, young girls due to the fact that he could never know how it feels inspired to live. Like a leach, once Epstein had his fill, he would unlatch and seek out another victim. The only sense of justice I had hoped to see was Epstein being sentenced. However, Epstein died as he lived, taking the easy way out without any responsibility. Your Honor, the next statement is also a statement of a Jane Doe. May it please the court. I was a 16-year-old virgin when Jeffrey Epstein first raped me. I was naive and gullable. He was a pillar of finance and a giant in the world that I was an insignificant SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00000716",
