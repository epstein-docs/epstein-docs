There is no statutory rape because there is no penetration, and that is the answer to that question. 5 THE COURT: All right. 6 We will set this down for a detention hearing on Thursday, July 11, for the continuation of the detention hearing. Thursday, July 11, at 2 p.m. 9 10 The defendant is detained at least until the continuation of the detention hearing pursuant to 18 United States Code 3142(f). 12 I have been advised by Judge Berman that he wants to see counsel right after these proceedings. Judge Berman's courtroom is 17B. So counsel and Mr. Epstein should go to 17B. 15 All right. Anything else from the government? 16 MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, ordinarily we would ask to exclude speedy trial time, but I think because we are going directly to Judge Berman, we have no such application. 19 THE COURT: Mr. Weingarten, anything else? 20 MR.
