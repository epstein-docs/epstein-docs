As noted in the financial report, the $22.5 million figure represents the value of all of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse's assets. The three properties securing the bond include all of the real property that Ms. Maxwell and her spouse own in the United States, including their primary family residence.\n\n- Five additional bonds totaling approximately $5 million co-signed by seven of Ms. Maxwell's closest friends and family members. The individual bonds are in amounts that would cause significant financial hardship to these sureties if Ms. Maxwell were to flee. These include:\n  - A $1.5 million bond co-signed by [redacted], both U.S. citizens and residents, and fully secured by [redacted] primary residence\n  - A $3.5 million bond co-signed by [redacted], who are U.K. citizens and residents. The $3.5 million sum represents virtually all of [redacted] assets. [redacted] is the guarantor of the existing mortgages on these assets.\n  - A $25,000 bond co-signed by [redacted], a U.S. citizen and resident, and fully secured by $25,000 in cash.\n  - A $25,000 bond signed by [redacted], a close family friend, and fully secured by $25,000 in cash. The cash security is money that [redacted] planned to set aside for his own daughter's future, but he is prepared to pledge it for Ms. Maxwell.\n  - A $2,000 bond signed by [redacted], a close family friend, who is a U.S. citizen and resident, and fully secured by $2,000 in cash.\n\n- A $1 million bond posted by the security company that would provide security services to Ms. Maxwell if she is granted bail and transferred to restrictive home confinement. This bond is significant as we are unaware of a security company ever posting its own bond in support of a bail application. The head of the security\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-00001980",
