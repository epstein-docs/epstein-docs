She is a person who my children always regarded as sparkling and engaging, and dedicated to her oceans conservation work and other business projects.\nI would describe her as a woman of principle; very disciplined with an extraordinary work ethic, instilled by both her parents. She is the youngest of seven surviving siblings, all of whom are close and all of whom have the same work ethic and integrity.\nI have at no point given any credence to the ridiculous and defamatory statements in the press about her being in hiding from law enforcement; this has never been the case. She would just like an opportunity to prepare her defence in an appropriate manner.\nI am totally confident that Ghislaine will appear in court as required, and I am prepared to sign a bond in the amount of $3.5 million in support of her bail application. This amount represents the value of effectively all of my assets, including my home. If I lost these assets because Ghislaine violated the conditions of her release, I would be financially ruined. I make this pledge without reservation because I know that Ghislaine will remain in the United States to face the charges against her, which she vehemently denies.\nYours sincerely\n[redacted signature]\nDOJ-OGR-00002040",
