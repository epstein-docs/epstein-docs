The substance of this information is critical to the defense because it negates the entire theory of prosecution.\nThe Government has not provided any information about the genesis of the Non-Prosecution Agreement (\"NPA\") that the Government entered into with Jeffrey Epstein in 2007.

Neither the fact of these meetings nor the content has been disclosed. This is significant exculpatory information that is needed to investigate, prepare motions, and defend at trial.6\nWe assume that many of the potential Government trial witnesses either participated or benefited from Epstein's NPA because the plea agreement provided for a mechanism where the claimants were paid money by Epstein, who could not challenge liability, only the amount.
