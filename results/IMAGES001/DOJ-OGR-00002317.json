Alternatively, the Court should direct the government to provide Ms. Maxwell with a Bill of Particulars and discovery as requested in her contemporaneously filed Memorandum in Support of Motion for Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures.\n\nDated: January 25, 2021\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\ns/ Jeffrey S.
