BERMAN UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE USDC SDNY DOCUMENT ELECTRONICALLY FILED DOC #: DATE FILED: 9/4/19 September 4, 2019 Bruce A. Green Louis Stein Chair Fordham University School of Law 150 West 62nd Street Room 7-168 New York City, NY 10023 Dear Professor Green, Thank you for your letter of August 30, 2019. I appreciate your taking the time to clarify the record. I learned that you had been \"retained to provide opinions as an expert on legal ethics\" in Giuffre v. Dershowitz following the August 27, 2019 public hearing in US v. Epstein. I learned of your role in the Giuffre case by reading your affidavit, dated June 7, 2019, which includes your legal ethics opinion that David Boies should be disqualified from representing Ms. Giuffre in that matter. As you are aware, both Mr. Boies and Ms. Giuffre were invited to testify at the August 27, 2019 hearing. I remain surprised that your advocacy of Mr. Boies' disqualification from representing Ms. Giuffre (in a case obviously related to US v. Epstein) was not disclosed simultaneously with your August 26, 2019 Law Journal opinion piece entitled \"The Judge in Epstein's Case Should Not Turn the Dismissal Into a Drama for the Victims.\" I am also surprised that you would find the August 27, 2019 public hearing to be an inappropriate occasion for transparency in light of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57 and the Crime Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3771. You wrote: \"This is an odd moment for transparency in a criminal case.\" 1 DOJ-OGR-00000727",
