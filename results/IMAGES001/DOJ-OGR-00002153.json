  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-22 Filed 12/14/20 Page 29 of 30 under the Treaty as amended by the Instrument Amending the Treaty and/or under the USA/EU Agreement on Extradition in connection with the Indictment, I would be entitled to argue that I should not be extradited to the United States on the ground of my French citizenship. I understand that in the absence of my consent to extradition, I cannot be surrendered to the United States authorities unless and until a court in France issues a ruling finding that there are no bars to my extradition, followed by an extradition decree issued by the French government. 3. If I am released on bail in connection with the Indictment, I hereby voluntarily and irrevocably waive any rights to contest any extradition request by the United States under the Treaty as amended by the Instrument Amending the Treaty as well as under the USA/EU Agreement on Extradition with respect to the offenses charged in the Indictment. Specifically, I consent to extradition in accordance with Article 11 of the USA/EU Agreement on Extradition as incorporated in the Treaty by the Instrument Amending the Treaty, in connection with the offenses charged in the Indictment. In addition, to the extent that it might be relevant, I waive any rights to assert that any bars to extradition apply, and I confirm that no such bars apply. 4. In the event that I violate my bail conditions after being released, I understand that the purpose of this affidavit is for the government to offer it to the authorities in France when my extradition is sought by the United States government in relation to the charges in the Indictment. I understand that France authorities may use this affidavit to assist in determining my extraditability. 5. I make this waiver freely and voluntarily, after having consulted with counsel. Dated this _____ day of December 2020. Ghislaine Maxwell",
