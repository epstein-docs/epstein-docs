It strikes me\nthat they're different kind of concepts.\nMR. WEINBERG: I think your Honor is completely\ncorrect. There is an overlap. I think the danger to the\ncommunity is abated more by a lesser list of conditions that I\ndon't even think the government would quarrel with, were they\nnot seeking detention.\nWe could work with the United States Attorney and\nagree to conditions that would essentially eliminate danger\nbecause he'd have no way to communicate, so long as the\ngovernment trusted that the lawyers who were visiting him were\nnot going to go and engage in license threatening misbehavior\nwhich I assure you that Mr. Weingarten, myself, and Mr. Fernich\nare not.\nThe conditions for flight, if I can turn to flight, I\ncontend deal directly with some of your Honor's questions about\nthe monetary conditions and some of the government's objections\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
