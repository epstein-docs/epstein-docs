FBI records reflect that Accuser-23 was interviewed on November 14, 2006 as part of an ongoing investigation by the government into Epstein and others as documented in FBI case file 31-E-MM-108062-49.

It also was no secret that Epstein worked out a deal with the government that knew about Mr. Epstein and the parade of young women being brought to Mr. Epstein’s houses.” See, https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/us/epstein-farmer-sisters-maxwell.html.

Sperou, 442 P.3d 581 (Or. 2019) (use of word “victim” by prosecutors and state witnesses during trial violated presumption of innocence and constituted improper witness vouching).\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-00002510",
