  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 69 Filed 11/06/20 Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant, the Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI's prior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file came from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2020, the FBI finished providing the Government all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because this production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government's filter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\nOn October 7, 2020, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released to the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government completed its responsiveness review on October 21, 2020, having identified approximately 1.2 million documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same night, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and download all of the responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the time that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the November 9, 2020 discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of stamping and downloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor's best efforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\nIn particular, on November 4, 2020, the vendor informed the Government that although it has finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the responsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November 19, 2020. The vendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it will need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the defense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce these responsive documents by the November 9, 2020 deadline. Accordingly, on November 4, 2020, the Government contracted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery deadline solely for this production.\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This morning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this production to November 23, 2020 on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion deadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and accordingly requests that defense motions be due on January 11, 2021, Government responses be due on February 12, 2021, and defense replies be due on February 19, 2021. Second, the defense asked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside the Metropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\") by November 23, 2020. The Government has already purchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allow the defendant use that laptop for discovery review once the Government's IT department has disabled all wireless and communications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this condition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three Minor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2020, and fourth, the defense asked that the Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2020.\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which have no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law.
