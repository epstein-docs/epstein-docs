As noted, the crimes involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention. And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent until proven guilty, but if she were convicted of these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to incentivize her to flee. In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58 years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment if convicted.
