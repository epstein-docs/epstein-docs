She has never left the country wants only to fight the case and remain in the country to do that. The United States has been her home since 1991 - and she has *always* returned here. I have witnessed her great humility, I have witnessed her personal warmth and bravery, and her humanity and great resilience in the face of the tidal waves of negative adverse publicity in the social media and by the Press, all over the world.\n\nI attest that Ghislaine was only laying low for her own protection against vigilantes and the 'mob' who have been baying for her blood to this day. She has never hid from the authorities and is frustrated that she never had the opportunity to talk to them personally to counteract all the lies pouring out in the media.\n\nIn regard to bail, I know in every fiber of my being that will NOT skip bail and am co-signing a bond in the value of $1,500,000 which is secured by . I myself do not own any property or I would have put it up without hesitation.\n\nThere is another critical reason I know she will not skip bail if released on remand - This is because I am willing, to stay with Ghislaine 24 × 7 if she is released into my personal custody - in a residence in New York that we have located - for as long as necessary. I am prepared to stay with her 24/7 indefinitely and utterly not seek to flee her bail and I completely assure the court that if she is released into my custody that she will remain with me 24x7x365 and will not leave the premises unless required to do so by the court and in direct coordination with them.\n\nYours respectfully,",
