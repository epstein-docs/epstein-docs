Further, confidential attorney-client communications conducted during video teleconferencing (VTC) are now further compromised by the repositioning of a camera with sensitive audio recording, putting a chill on privileged communication. During VTC conferences, counsel can hear conversation among the guards, so it is likely that the guards, who seem to be writing during those sessions, are able to hear discussions between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. Last night, prior to the filing of defense replies to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions, the MDC refused her request to speak with her lawyers to provide information bearing on those filings. Such denial violates the BOP's Program Statement pertaining to providing legal calls upon request of pretrial inmates. See https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/7331_004.pdf at par. 24(c). The chronic difficulties related to Ms. Maxwell's review of the millions of documents of electronic discovery are continuing to negatively impact her ability to prepare for a trial that is only a few months away.\n10\nDOJ-OGR-00001265",
