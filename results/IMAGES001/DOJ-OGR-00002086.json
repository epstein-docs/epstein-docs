According to the protocol, Ms. Maxwell was to move away from the windows, if possible, and move into a safe room inside the house. This is normal protocol in these situations. A safe room typically has water, food and communications. It is also able to be locked and barricaded from the inside to ensure it gives enough time for a 911 call to be placed and the police to arrive before exposure to the threat.\n12. reported to me immediately after Ghislaine Maxwell's arrest. He confirmed to me that after radioing Ms. Maxwell, one or two vehicles pulled up and stopped near where was standing. He was told to stop and move no further by a number of individuals who got out of the vehicles. At that time, he could see that they were federal agents because they were wearing FBI jackets and had weapons visible. The agents physically searched and questioned him.\n13. was later taken to a vehicle where Ms. Maxwell was sitting. She asked him if he would look after the dogs and the cat, which he agreed to do.\n14. I understand that, as part of her renewed bail application, Ms. Maxwell is proposing a substantial bail package that will include the following conditions, among others: (i) Ms. Maxwell will surrender all of her travel documents, and (ii) she will be subject to home confinement with electronic GPS monitoring. I also understand that, upon release, Ms. Maxwell will be monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by our security teams.\n15. In light of the proposed bail package and the strict conditions of her confinement post-release, as well as our long-standing relationship with Ms. Maxwell, my company will be posting a $1 million bond in support of her bail application.\n16. I have never once posted a bond for a client in the past. I am happy to post a bond for Ms. Maxwell in light of the factors discussed above and my relationship with her, because I am confident that she will not try to flee.\nDOJ-OGR-00002086",
