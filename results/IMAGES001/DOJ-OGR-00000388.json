Is that accurate?\nMR. ROSSMILLER: That's correct, your Honor. I don't want to speak for defense counsel, but my understanding is they expect to put in some sort of written submission and return to argue the rest of the bail hearing on Thursday before Judge Pitman at 2:00. That is, if your Honor refers the bail hearing to Judge Pitman on that basis as well.\nTHE COURT: I might just take that bail application before me. We'll figure out a time when that would be comfortable for all of you. How is that?\nMR. WEINGARTEN: That's fine with the government, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: I have a few items on my list. I want to make mention, I'm sure Magistrate Judge Pitman did, of our presumption of innocence. Even though in some of these discussions, and probably more so when we get to bail, it may sound like we are talking about merits of the case, it's important that we underscore that the presumption of innocence pertains to Mr. Epstein, now and until such time, if it comes,\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00000388",
