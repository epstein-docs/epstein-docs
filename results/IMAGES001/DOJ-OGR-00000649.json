Indeed, as has been stated publicly, investigations into those matters have been ongoing, remain ongoing, and will continue following dismissal of the indictment here.\n\nI would also like to note that, as the government has previously mentioned, this dismissal in no way lessens the government's resolve to stand up for the victims in this case, both those who have come forward and those who have yet to do so. We agree with your Honor's sentiment that those victims should be respected, and we appreciate your Honor's recognition of that.\n\nOne housekeeping matter that I did want to reference for your Honor. The protective order in this case requires destruction or return of any and all discovery material upon conclusion of the case. We have been in communication with defense counsel, who have confirmed that they have returned all physical copies that they have of discovery that the government has produced to date, and they are in the process of deleting any copies that they may have made. So the parties are in compliance with the protective order.\n\nFinally, I just wanted to say a word about the victims in this case, and particularly those who are here in court\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00000649",
