Those are the written submissions: principally the indictment, the legal principles governing release versus remand, the presumption of remand in 18 U.S.C. section 1591 cases, danger to others and the community. This topic has seven subsections and fills over ten pages of the decision and order. I think it is fair to say that it is the heart of this decision, that is to say, dealing with danger to others and to the community.\n\nThen I deal with risk of flight. That has four subsections or factors, which are substantially the same factors that are used to analyze dangerousness.\n\nThen, finally, the bail package proposed by the defense. Specifically, I find in the decision and order that the government has established dangerousness to others and to the community by clear and convincing evidence and also that the government has established risk of flight by a preponderance of the evidence. I also reject the proposed bail package as irretrievably inadequate and go on in some detail concerning what I consider to be its deficiencies.\n\nIncidentally, I am not suggesting that a different bail package would be appropriate because I doubt that any bail package can overcome danger to the community.\n\nI focus then on dangerousness to others, most certainly including the minor victims in this case and prospective victims as well. I cite and quote, for example,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
