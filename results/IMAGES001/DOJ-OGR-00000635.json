(Freemasonry/ Rotary; See EXHIBITS G and H (EXHIBIT H affidavit ¶ 12-17) Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration).

Relator appealed.\n• On 7/27/19, Intervenor sent USDOJ attorneyz the 9th Circuit mediation form (See EXHIBIT J Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration), showing the course of action Intervenor intended to pursue on appeal. Intervenor also indicated that he intended to write about USDOJ's unlimited \"prosecutorial discretion\" to fraudulently dismiss False Claims complaints, as this \"prosecutorial discretion\" was the same \"prosecutorial discretion\" exercised by USDOJ and Alex Acosta in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Intervenor also attached an article by the former Deputy Attorney General of the United States (Donald Ayer), indicating that Barr was a \"fierce advocate of unchecked presidential power\". Intervenor also identified the judge in the District Ct. (formerly presiding over Intervenor's case), as being associated with the conspiracy.\n• According to newspaper reports, on 7/29/19, Jeffrey Epstein was taken off suicide watch.\n• According to newspaper reports, on 8/10/19, Epstein was found dead.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nIntervention in criminal matters \"have been granted in limited circumstances where 'a third party's constitutional or other federal rights are implicated by the resolution of a particular motion, request, or other issue during the course of a criminal case.'\" United States v.
