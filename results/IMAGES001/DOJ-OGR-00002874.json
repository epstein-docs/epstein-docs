Mollo Building One Saint Andrew's Plaza New York, New York 10007 March 29, 2021 VIA ECF The Honorable Alison J. Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: The Government respectfully submits this letter to clarify a statement in its prior letter to the Court in the above-referenced case dated October 7, 2020 (the \"Letter\"). (Dkt. No. 63). In the Letter, the Government stated, \"The Prosecution Team in this case had no involvement in the Florida Investigation, which predated the instant investigation by approximately eight years.\" (Letter at 4). Although it is certainly correct that none of the individual prosecutors, agents, or investigators on the Prosecution Team had any involvement in the Florida Investigation, the Government writes to bring the following additional facts to the Court's attention. Recently, defense counsel brought to the Government's attention information suggesting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") New York Office may have participated in certain aspects of the Florida Investigation between 2005 and 2010. In response, the Government has reviewed portions of its files, including portions of the file of the FBI's Palm Beach Resident Agency (the \"FBI Florida Office\"), for documentation indicating that the FBI New York Office interacted with the FBI Florida Office or with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern DOJ-OGR-00002874",
