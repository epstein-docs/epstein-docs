Prior to her arrest, Ms. Maxwell and her spouse had discussed the idea of getting\na divorce as an additional way to create distance between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse to\nprotect him from the terrible consequences of being associated with her.\nNevertheless, in the weeks following the initial bail hearing,\nShe and her spouse therefore had no reason to continue\ndiscussing divorce, which neither of them wanted in the first place. Nor was there any\nreason for her spouse to refrain from stepping forward as a co-signer. In sum, the\ngovernment has offered nothing but unsupported innuendo to suggest that Ms. Maxwell's\nrelationship with her spouse is not a powerful tie to this country.\nThe government's assertion that Ms. Maxwell must not have a close relationship\nwith is particularly callous\nand belied by the facts.

In fact, the government has proffered nothing that\ncalls into question the report's detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse's assets for\nthe last five years, which addresses one of the Court's principal reasons for denying bail.\nRather than question the report itself, the government attempts to argue that Ms.\nMaxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets.
