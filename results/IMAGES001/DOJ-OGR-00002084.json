For 15 of those years, I served in the United Kingdom Special Forces. I have worked in the security industry for ten years and have gained a level 6 Security Risk Management Consultants (SRMC) qualification, working towards a master's degree in Risk Management. I hold numerous instructional and operational licenses qualifying me to deliver several types of security services under the UK Security Industry Authority, including a certification to provide close protection services for individuals facing physical threats. I am a member of the Academy of Security Intelligence and Risk Studies and have owned and operated security companies in all capacities in a number of different countries. 2. As part of my security portfolio, I have secured global assets and have protected numerous high value persons. As an example, I was contracted to guard the UK's third richest person, according to Forbes, after he broke his agreed bail conditions with another consultant. Under my protection never escaped again and completed his high-profile court appearances to cessation. 3. I have provided security consultation and services for the Maxwell family for a number of years in both the United Kingdom and United States. I provided security services for Ghislaine Maxwell from approximately July 2019 through up to the time of her arrest on July 2, 2020. 4. Ms. Maxwell faced a number of security issues. For example, I was aware that she received a number of death threats connected to her relationship with Jeffery Epstein some 20 years previously. She was also the target of aggressive behavior by members of the press who were trying to achieve a 'scoop.' This kind of behavior is not only harassing, but can be life threatening. A good example is the case of Princess Diana, who unfortunately lost her life due to DOJ-OGR-00002084",
