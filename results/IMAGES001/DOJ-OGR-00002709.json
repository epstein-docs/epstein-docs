It is further requested that the Court direct the government to disclose such information immediately upon its discovery.\n\nIt is well settled that pursuant to Brady and its progeny, the government must disclose evidence, information, and facts that could be used to impeach its witnesses. See United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 221, 225 (2d Cir. 2007). Such evidence includes any and all evidence of a witness' prior crimes or acts of moral turpitude, prior inconsistent statements, and statements demonstrating a lack of knowledge or a denial of the facts of the case or the alleged guilt of the defendant, and specific instances of conduct from which it can be inferred the witness is untruthful.\n\nBut disclosure of Brady material is not the end of the line. Quite the contrary, it is a launching point for an investigation that may bear critical information. In order to mount an effective defense, Ms. Maxwell must receive this material in sufficient time to investigate and develop it for effective use before and during trial. We therefore request the immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio material.\n\nThe government takes the customary position that it will turn over any Giglio material at the time it provides prior statements of witnesses pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3500. In doing so, the government erroneously assumes that Giglio material is something other than Brady material.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made clear that impeachment evidence 'falls within the Brady rule.'
