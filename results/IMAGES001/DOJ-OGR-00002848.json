Epstein would often travel from New York to Florida, where he would then have the scheduled appointments.\n\nb. When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she would be greeted by an employee of Epstein's, including, at times, MAXWELL. The victim would then be escorted to a room with a massage table. Once inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. During these encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. EPSTEIN would also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask the victim to touch him while he masturbated, and touch the victim's genitals with his hands or with sex toys.\n\nc. In connection with each sexual encounter, Epstein or one of his employees or associates, including, at times, MAXWELL, paid the victim in cash. Each victim was typically paid hundreds of dollars for each encounter.\n\n8.
