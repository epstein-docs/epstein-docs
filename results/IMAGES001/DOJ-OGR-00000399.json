In the pretrial services report\n6 which was prepared today -- how many, if more than one,\n7 passports does Mr. Epstein have?\n8 MR. WEINGARTEN: Mr. Epstein reported today one. Two\n9 others were rescinded. As we understand it, there is one\n10 effective passport today.\n11 I would like to make one other point about the\n12 pretrial that is extremely important.\n13 THE COURT: Go ahead.\n14 MR. WEINGARTEN: The way it reads is that we have\n15 refused to provide information about income and assets.\n16 THE COURT: I didn't really read it that way myself.\n17 I thought it was incomplete in some places and I thought it\n18 could be beefed up, so to speak. But I imagine that in the\n19 bail application those matters may be dealt with.\n20 MR. WEINGARTEN: Exactly.\n21 THE COURT: For Mr. Rossmiller: In your letter you\n22 describe some obstruction or harassment, witness tampering,\n23 alleged, by Mr. Epstein. That, I take it, is going to be\n24 included in any response or any bail submission made by the\n25 government?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00000399",
