Intervenor has been denied these rights so that the conspiracy can continue laundering tax money. Intervenor has already proven that USDOJ/ OIG are politically corrupt federal agencies, as intervenor filed a whistleblower complaint with WA State Auditor and OIG in 2012/2013 because he was worried about structural bridge collapse. As a result of filing this complaint, intervenor had his career and reputation destroyed by OIG, State of WA, and his attorneyz. Relator has already shown that OIG/ USDOJ agencies cannot be trusted as they specialize in fraud and deception (see complaint No CV 18-6051 on Pacer for the entire complaint).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, and the fact that USDOJ and OIG have already been proven by relator to be politically corrupt agencies, G. respectfully requests that the Court approve his motion, and surrender USDOJ to relator.\nThe obstruction of the quo warranto proceedings and the \"apparent acquittal\" for USDOJ, has resulted in the \"apparent suicide\" of Jeffrey Epstein while under USDOJ / Bill Barr watch. Relator has already demonstrated/ proven that USDOJ/ OIG are corrupt and assisting Republicans and \"Democrats\" to launder tax money.
