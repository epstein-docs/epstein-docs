Many questions remain unanswered, and the public's interest remains.\"); (Epstein Dkt. 61 at 1; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 1). Attention given to the Epstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2025 Memorandum announcing the conclusions of the Government's review into the investigation. See id.\n\nThe instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in that memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein's crimes: to provide information to the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\n\n4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury transcripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 61 at 1; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 1). As stated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be \"subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information\" (Epstein Dkt. 61 at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. How Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks how long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. The grand jury met in June and July of 2019 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met in June and July of 2020 and March of 2021 in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has not dulled the public's interest in these cases. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 107 (\"if historical interest in a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that the public's interest in release of the information is substantial\").\n\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-00000751",
