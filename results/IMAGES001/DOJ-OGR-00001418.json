Tiffany Days, April 29, 2021, which can be accessed at: https://tinyurl.com/48yw29px.\nWe are appealing to this Court to do something, as Judge McMahon pleaded. Ghislaine Maxwell has a Constitutional right to be able to prepare effectively for trial. The conditions of her pretrial detention deprive her of that right. For almost a year, she has been held in the equivalent of solitary confinement, in deteriorating health and mental condition from lack of sleep because she is intentionally awakened every 15 minutes by lights shined directly into her small cell, inadequate water and food, the constant glare of neon light, and intrusive searches, including having hands forced into her mouth in a squalid facility where COVID has run rampant.\nMs. Maxwell understands that she and the government are not going to agree on the facts. This is an adversary system, of course. But when the government's representations about the conditions of confinement continue to be demonstrably and admittedly false, there needs to be an intervention. If the Court is not prepared to temporarily release Ms. Maxwell on bond so that she can prepare for trial, it should\n10\nDOJ-OGR-00001418",
