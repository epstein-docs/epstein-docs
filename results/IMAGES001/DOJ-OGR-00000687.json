Thank you. THE COURT: Thank you. MR. CASSELL: I'll be very brief because I know there are others that want to speak here. I'm Paul Cassell, C-a-s-s-e-l-l, previously served as a federal judge at the District of Utah, currently a law professor, where I teach crime victims rights at the University of Utah, College of Law. I just wanted to take one minute to address some suggestion that there would be no need for a hearing this morning. I think, having heard already from these powerful victims and recognizing how important giving those statements will be in the trajectory of their lives, makes clear that your Honor has followed exactly the right path. Legally, there is one precedent, which is U.S. v. Heaton, a case that you cited that I wrote about a decade ago, and as explained in that opinion, victims have important interests in the criminal justice system that can only be recognized if they're given their day in court. With all due respect to other law professors that have recently written an article, I think transparency is one of the overriding objectives in our criminal justice system, and the one substantive action that I would urge your Honor to take today is to publish your remarks as a published opinion. The Heaton case is, to my knowledge, the only reported decision on SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00000687",
