NATHAN, District Judge: An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel, and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate by video. Co-counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed of the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements, seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to DOJ-OGR-00001540",
