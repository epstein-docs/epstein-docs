What is the government's position\n7\nwith respect to the relevance of the alleged victim statements\n8\nin the 3142 analysis?\n9\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, the government has not proffered\n10\nvictim's testimony or information in an effort to support its\n11\nmotion. To the contrary, the victims have appeared consistent\n12\nwith their rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act. Of\n13\ncourse, as we noted in our reply brief, it is very important to\n14\nthe government that the victims receive justice in this case\n15\nand that there be a trial so that that could happen. That is\n16\nvery important to the government, and we respectfully submit\n17\nthat the court should take that into account. However, again,\n18\nthe victims' participation in this proceeding is pursuant to\n19\ntheir rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act. It is not\n20\npart of the government's presentation in this case.\n21\nTHE COURT: Okay. So I should not consider it --\n22\nshould not consider the substance of the statements in the\n23\noverall bail analysis.\n24\nMS.
