The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant's new arguments change the Court's original determination.\n\nD. The Defendant's conditions of confinement do not justify release\n\nLastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant's argument that the conditions of her confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and thus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully dispute that she has received \"more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her attorneys.\" Gov't Opp'n at 29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by BOP, including a recent lockdown due to COVID-19 that curtailed in-person legal visitations, the Defendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her constitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknowledges the Defendant's concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to provide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court has determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.3\n\n3 The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly with her attorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense. Defense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests. To the extent they are not reasonably accommodated, an application may be made to the Court.\n\n20\n\nDOJ-OGR-00002252",
