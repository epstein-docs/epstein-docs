While some of them elected not to be here today, that opportunity should always be allowed for them. In 2008, we filed that case under the Crime Victims' Rights Act because our clients' rights were violated, and as your Honor knows, a federal judge has ruled in our clients' favor that their rights were violated. So this hearing today means a lot to them. The fact that they may never get their chance to speak in court, they may never get complete closure, and all of us have to wonder, if their rights had been afforded them the first time, would any of us be here right now. Or wouldn't it more likely be the case that everyone, including Jeffrey Epstein, would have turned out better for it? Today, I have not only represented, but met and become very close with many of these victims. Many of these survivors. They are very strong people. They are people who have persevered through a lot of adversity. It's been a roller coaster of emotions that has led us to where we are today. And while they have all been cast over the years because of the secrecy of the first investigation, in the shadow as victims, you can't put them all in one bucket and say one size fits all. They are each individual people who were harmed differently and SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00000671",
