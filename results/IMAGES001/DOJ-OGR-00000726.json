Green\nLouis Stein Chair\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:  \nDATE FILED: 9/4/19\nPhone: 212-636-6851\nFax: 212-636-6899\nbgreen@law.fordham.edu\n\nHon. Richard M. Berman\nU.S. District Court\nfor the Southern District of New York\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse\n500 Pearl Street\nNew York, NY 10007-1312\n\nRECEIVED\nSEP 04 2019\nCHAMBERS OF\nRICHARD M. BERMAN\nU.S.D.J.\n\nre: United States v. Epstein, 1:19-cr-00490-RMB\n\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nYesterday, I was provided a partial transcript of the August 27, 2019 hearing in the above-captioned case, and I am writing to clarify the record.\n\nAs you know, I co-authored a New York Law Journal article before the hearing. The transcript quotes the court, in pertinent part, as follows with reference to me and the article: \"On a somewhat more serious note, don't quote me on this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of that article is himself counsel in one of the Epstein-related cases. I was surprised to learn that very recently. I'm certain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was not disclosed in the Law Journal.\" Later in the hearing, attorney David Boies made comments consistent with those of the court.\n\nJust to clear up the evident misunderstanding: I have never been counsel to Epstein or his estate or to anyone in an Epstein-related case. I did serve as an expert witness, by way of expert declaration, in support of Professor Dershowitz's motion to disqualify Mr. Boies and his law firm in Giuffre v. Dershowitz, 1:19-cv-03377 (SDNY), a pending defamation case that might be described as \"Epstein-related.\" My work as an expert witness, which concluded in June, did not involve my representation of, or advocacy on behalf of, Professor Dershowitz. I did not serve as counsel or as an advocate on anyone's behalf in co-authoring the law journal article.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nBruce A. Green\n\ncc: AUSA Maurene Comey; Martin G. Weinberg, Esq.; Reid Weingarten, Esq.; David Boies, Esq.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00000726",
