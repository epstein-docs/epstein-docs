  "full_text": "Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 53 Filed 09/03/19 Page 52 of 86 52 J8RPEPS2 brought against Mr. Dershowitz, but I would have expected that the Law Journal or Professor Green himself would have disclosed that connection, which I think is a conflict. But regardless of the appropriateness of his disclosure, or lack of disclosure, I think that his article opposing allowing the victims to have a voice in this proceeding is inconsistent not only with the policy that underlies the Crime Victim Rights Act and the very statute that Mr. Epstein is being prosecuted under, but it ignores the actual language of those statutes, and many other statutes, in which Congress has made clear that the purpose of the criminal law is no longer simply to punish the individual defendant, but it is to find some way of trying to mitigate the damage that has been done to the victims through restitution and economic mitigation, but also through the ability to confront and to have the court system and the justice system and the prosecutors treat these victims as they are victims, as they are human beings, and they are entitled to the respect that our society needs to give every human being. So I think that this is not only commendable, but I think it is what the law requires. In response to the question the Court asked, I have discussed this hearing with my clients. I have told them that, under the applicable law, the government has no alternative but to move to dismiss this case, and I believe under the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
