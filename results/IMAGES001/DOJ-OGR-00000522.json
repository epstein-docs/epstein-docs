The Court asked a question about that. Your Honor, we just became aware of those payments late last week. We, frankly, don't have additional information other than that they were paid, that they were paid to two individuals who were associated with the defendant at the time, and that those two individuals are both listed in the non-prosecution agreement. So there is certainly an inference there that the defendant was attempting to influence them right around when he came back into public consciousness. Your Honor, the victims in this case seek detention and fear his release. And most of all, he is an extraordinary flight risk. As the government has discussed, he has six homes. He owns two private islands. He owns a residence in France. And he has told his own financial institution that he is worth more than $500 million. In the government's filing last Monday, we described the defendant as being extraordinarily wealthy which was confirmed by the defense even in his very minimal financial disclosure.
