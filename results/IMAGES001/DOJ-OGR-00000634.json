Intervenor has witnessed the same pattern of political/ judicial corruption at work in his own case; and has now identified the same conspiracy at work in this case.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n- Intervenor was a licensed engineer and bridge inspector for State of Washington. In 2012/2013, Intervenor filed a whistleblower complaint with the Washington State Auditor's Office. The complaint was escalated to Michael Horowitz's office of the Inspector General (OIG; See EXHIBIT A Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration). OIG refused to investigate the complaint. State of Washington fraudulently concealed that it secured funds for fixing the bridges that Intervenor complained about, and misrepresented the safety issue. Intervenor later discovered that State of Washington concealed this information so that “Democrats” and Republicans could launder $70 billion to the Association of General Contractors (AGC) and the labor unions through intervenor's attorneyz.\n- On 12/27/19, Intervenor filed a False Claims complaint in the District Ct of Western WA under the False Claims Act, seeking $1 billion in damages and qui tam bounty against “Democrats”, Republicans, and his former attorneys for fraud (See EXHIBIT B Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration (first 2 pages only)).\n- On 5/1/13, USDOJ submitted a fraudulent motion to dismiss intervenor's claim (See EXHIBIT C Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration), falsely stating that intervenor's allegations “lack sufficient factual and legal support.”\n- On 5/13/19, Intervenor filed a petition for quo warranto against Bill Barr and other USDOJ attorneys for conspiracy, fraud, obstruction, and perjury (See EXHIBIT D Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration).\n- On 5/14/19, Intervenor had his False Claims complaint fraudulently dismissed by the District Ct., after fraud, perjury, and obstruction were proven against USDOJ (See EXHIBIT E Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration).\n\nDAVID GOLDEN\n15151 NW MASON HILL RD\nNORTH PLAINS, OR 97133\n\nMOTION TO INTERVENE - 2\nDOJ-OGR-00000634",
