I must attest to my utter shock at the arrest of on the charges she is facing. From all I know of her she would not be capable of such behavior. I never witnessed Ghislaine be violent or remotely sexually inappropriate with anybody of any age or gender, ever. She is a warm, loving and generous human being and I am told she is bearing up with great courage and fortitude inside the detention center and those are some of the qualities in her character that are sustaining her in her current awful circumstances. I believe she is innocent of the charges brought against her and determined to prove her innocence. I believe she wants nothing else but to fight these charges in court in July 2021 and to clear her name and therefore would never seek to flee anywhere if she were granted bail. She, like all people so charged, have a constitutional right to due process and indeed she has declared herself to be innocent of all charges. She is innocent until proven otherwise and she like all people so charged - is entitled to a fair trial by a jury of her peers. I, have complete faith in Ghislaine's respect for the judicial process and in her determination to fight all the charges brought against her. I am certain and confident of Ghislaine's trustworthiness and of the importance of her achieving bail in order to properly be able to prepare her defense to the charges she faces. Yours respectfully, DOJ-OGR-00002046",
