I understand that I have a right to be present at all conferences concerning this indictment that are held by a judge in the Southern District of New York, unless the conference involves only a question of law. I understand that at these conferences the judge may, among other things, 1) set a schedule for the case including the date at which the trial will be held, and 2) determine whether, under the Speedy Trial Act, certain periods of time should be properly excluded in setting the time by which the trial must occur. I have discussed these issues with my attorney and wish to give up my right to be physically present at the upcoming conference. By signing this document, I wish to advise the court that I willingly give up my right to be physically present at the upcoming conference in my case on account of the COVID-19 pandemic so long as the following conditions are met. I want my attorney to be able to participate in the proceeding and to be able to speak on my behalf during the proceeding. I also want the ability to speak privately with my attorney at any time during the proceeding if I wish to do so. Date: 7/10/2020 Signature of Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell by Christian R. Everdell, Esq. Ghislaine Maxwell Print Name I hereby affirm that I am aware of my obligation to discuss with my client the charges contained in the indictment, my client's rights to attend and participate in the criminal proceedings encompassed by this waiver, and this waiver form. I affirm that my client knowingly and voluntarily consents to the proceedings being held in my client's absence. I will inform my client of what transpires at the proceedings and provide my client with a copy of the transcript of the proceedings, if requested. Date: 7/10/2020 Signature of Defense Counsel Christian R. Everdell Print Name Addendum for a defendant who requires services of an interpreter: I used the services of an interpreter to discuss these issues with the defendant.
