FARMER: Annie, A-n-n-i-e, Farmer, F-a-r-m-e-r.\nI had the opportunity to speak at Jeffrey Epstein's bail hearing, and I really appreciate that you heard me and listened to me that day. I am so sorry that others will not have the opportunity to stand before him the way that I did. But I'm here today to speak on behalf of my sister, Maria Farmer, who could not be here.\nJeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell not only assaulted her, but as we're hearing from so many of these brave women here today, they stole her dreams and her livelihood. She risked her safety in 1996, so many years ago, to report them, to no avail, and it is heartbreaking to her and to me that all this destruction has been wrought since that time.\nWe were deeply disappointed and disturbed by Epstein's death and the fact that that was allowed to happen while he was in the government's custody, and I'm encouraged to hear that there will be a full investigation as to how that was allowed to happen.\nBut it is extremely important, as others are saying, that he did not act alone and that the other people that were a part of what he did are held accountable and that that investigation continues.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00000696",
