I will exclude time from today's date until July 12, 2021, which I have said is a firm trial date. I do find that the ends of justice served by excluding this time outweigh the interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial. The time is necessary for the production of discovery and view of that by defense, time for the defense to consider and prepare any available motions and, in the absence of resolution of the case, time for the parties to prepare for trial.\n12 To Ms. Moe and Mr. Cohen, although I have not set an interim status conference in the case, we do have our motion schedule, but for both sides, if at any point you wish to be before the court for any reason, simply put in a letter and we will get something on the calendar as soon as we conceivably can.\n18 With that, Mr. Cohen, let me ask counsel if there is any reason that we should not turn now to the argument for bail?\n21 MR. COHEN: No, your Honor.\n22 THE COURT: Ms. Moe?\n23 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.\n24 THE COURT: All right. I will hear on that question.\n25 It is the government's motion for detention, so I propose\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
