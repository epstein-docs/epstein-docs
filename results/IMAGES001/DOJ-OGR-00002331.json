Ms. Maxwell has therefore made a prima facie showing of a violation of the fair cross-section requirement.\n\nAccordingly, the government has the burden of showing that attainment of a fair cross-section would have been incompatible with a significant state interest. The government cannot do so. To the extent that the government asserts a significant state interest in containing COVID-19, it cannot show that attainment of a fair cross-section would have been incompatible with that interest. As noted above, a Manhattan grand jury convened as early as June 25, 2020; there appears to have been no reason, other than a publicity-driven desire to arrest Ms. Maxwell on the anniversary of the Epstein indictment, why the government could not have waited until that time. The indictment therefore violates Ms. Maxwell's Sixth Amendment right and should be dismissed.\n\nDated: January 25, 2021\nNew York, New York\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n/s/ Mark S. Cohen\nMark S.
