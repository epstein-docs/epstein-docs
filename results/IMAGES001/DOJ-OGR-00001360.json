  "full_text": "takes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant's isolation cell. Accordingly, the defendant is permitted out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the defendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on which to place social or attorney calls, and a shower. The defendant is also permitted outdoor recreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her attorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-teleconference (\"VTC\") calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of attorney VTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdowns or short staffing, delay the defendant's arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 30 minutes. When such delay occurs, however, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either by extending that day's VTC call or by permitting the defendant extra time on the next day's VTC call. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a camera approximately 30 feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the VTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view either the defendant or her attorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does not capture any sound from the defendant's VTC calls with her attorneys. In other words, the camera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC room. The defendant is also permitted to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her attorneys as needed. In addition, defense counsel now have the option of meeting with the defendant in person at the MDC. On or about February 16, 2021, the MDC resumed in-person visitation. As a result, DOJ-OGR-00001360",
