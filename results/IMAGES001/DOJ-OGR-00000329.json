Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nJuly 12, 2019\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n500 Pearl Street\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)\nDear Judge Berman:\nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant's Motion for Pretrial Release (the \"Release Motion\"), dated July 11, 2019 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its Memorandum in Support of Detention (the \"Detention Memo\"), submitted to Magistrate Judge Pitman on July 8, 2019, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A).\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for years. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of minors, including girls as young as 14 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a registered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend, despite unsuccessfully attempting to have that classification lowered. And any doubt that the defendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered hundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhattan mansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime involving a juvenile.\nThe defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated testimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to prison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which remain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation of witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports about his conduct reemerged. And he continues to show a shocking lack of understanding of the gravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and casual disparagement of victims in his arguments.\nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges, and the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions that are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant\nDOJ-OGR-00000329",
