One victim's views are expressed in the government's reply memorandum; one victim has submitted a statement to the government and asked that the government read it during today's proceedings; and one victim has asked to be heard directly, and the government anticipates that she will make a statement at any time during this proceeding as necessitated by the court.\n3 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.\n4 Then, with that, returning to the schedule that you have laid out, and I thank counsel for conferring in advance, as to a proposed schedule, Mr. Cohen, let me just finalize if you agree to the proposed schedule that has been laid out by Ms. Moe and supplemented by you?\n5 MR.
