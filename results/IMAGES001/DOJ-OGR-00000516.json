That is not true with\nrespect to the charges here.\nThe presumption of remand, as in this case, may be\nrebutted by the defense. And if it is, the government has the\nburden of proving that remand is nevertheless warranted.\nIndeed, the government bears this burden of persuasion\nthroughout.\nThe burden with respect to the safety of the community\nis clear and convincing evidence, and the burden with respect\nto risk of flight is preponderance of the evidence.\nThe defense argues that the presumption of remand is\nrebutted here. And I refer to several places where they say\nthat, but one is at page 6 and following of their letter\napplication for release of Mr. Epstein.\nSo my question as relates to this burden and\npresumption is for the defense particularly, how was the burden\nrebutted in this case which is something that they contend\nthey've been able to do.\nAnd my question for the government is whether that\npresumption has been rebutted and, if so, how has the\ngovernment been able to prove remand is appropriate, if it has.\nSo here is another question. Actually, I have a lot\nof questions. But the ones that are on top of my mind are\nfive. We have all the time in the world. So if you have more\nquestions, I'd be happy to have them answered.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00000516",
