Nathan\nJuly 21, 2020\nPage 2\nIn an effort to protect the trial process from \"prejudicial outside interferences,\" this Court promulgated Local Criminal Rule 23.1(a) which provides, in relevant part, that:\nIt is the duty of the lawyer or law firm, ... and government agents and police officers, not to release or authorize the release of non-public information or opinion which a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication, in connection with pending or imminent criminal litigation with which they are associated, if there is a substantial likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.\nTo avoid any confusion this Court identified seven \"subject matters\" that \"presumptively involve a substantial likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.\" Id. at (d). Accordingly, lawyers for parties and witnesses and their agents are prohibited from publicly disseminating information concerning:\n(1) The prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments or other charges of crime), or the character or reputation of the accused...;\n(2) The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by the accused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement;\n(3) The performance of any examinations or tests or the accused's refusal or failure to submit to an examination or test;\n(4) The identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the lawyer or law firm may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not otherwise prohibited by law;\n(5) The possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense;\n(6) Information the lawyer or law firm knows is likely to be inadmissible at trial and would if disclosed create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an impartial trial; and\n(7) Any opinion as to the accused's guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the case.\nId. at (d)(1-7) (emphasis added).\nDOJ-OGR-00001636",
