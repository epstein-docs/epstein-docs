Chapter V of the French Code of Criminal Procedure (Articles 696 to 696-47-1) sets out legislative provisions pertaining to extradition.\n53. The rule against the extradition of nationals is set out under Article 696-4, which states that extradition shall not be granted when the requested person is a French national, and that nationality shall be assessed at the time of the facts in respect of which extradition is sought (« Extradition is not granted: 1° When the person sought has the French nationality, the latter being assessed at the time of the offence for which extradition is requested. »27).\n54. The rule under Article 696-4 only applies \"in the absence of an international convention stipulating otherwise\"28. Therefore, we must determine whether the rule against the extradition of nationals contained in the French Code of Criminal Procedure applies in respect of an extradition request made by the USA.\n55. Extradition requests between the United States and France are governed by the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France 199629, which supersedes French law as mentioned explicitly in Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure.\n56. Article 3(1) of the Extradition Treaty between France and the United States provides:\n\"There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United States shall have the power to surrender a national of the United States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offence was committed\".\n27 In French : « L'extradition n'est pas accordée : 1° Lorsque la personne réclamée a la nationalité française, cette dernière étant appréciée à l'époque de l'infraction pour laquelle l'extradition est requise ».\n28 Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure: \"In the absence of an international convention stipulating otherwise, the conditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this chapter. These provisions shall also apply to matters which would not have been regulated by international conventions\". (In French, « En l'absence de convention internationale en stipulant autrement, les conditions, la procédure et les effets de l'extradition sont déterminés par les dispositions du présent chapitre. Ces dispositions s'appliquent également aux points qui n'auraient pas été réglémentés par les conventions internationales »).\n29 The Extradition treaty between the USA and France was signed in Paris on April 23, 1996 and entered into force on February 1, 2002 (by Decree No. 2002-117 of 29 January 2002).\n51, rue Ampère - 75017 paris - tél. 01 88 33 51 80 - fax. 01 88 33 51 81 www.wjavocats.com - palais C1652 17 wj@wjavocats.com - DOJ-OGR-00002142",
