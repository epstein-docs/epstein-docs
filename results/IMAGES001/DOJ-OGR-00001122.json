  "full_text": "against Ms. Maxwell. For example, one post stated \"they need to get this bitch n string her up by her neck . . . f*ckin monster.\" Another stated:\n\nI hope someone finds her and kills her. That would be justice. Obviously her lawyers know's [sic] where she is, someone should stick them up to batteries until we find out where she is.\n\nThese posts were particularly chilling because some of them suggested that the authors might carry out the violent acts they had been threatening. For example, in response to an August 14, 2019 news report that Ms. Maxwell might be living in Massachusetts, one person wrote:\n\nSHE'S HERE in #Massachusetts ?! The bitch #GhislaineMaxwell who #SexTrafficked young girls for #Epstein ?!?! Why the hell isn't she being brought in for questioning @ManchesterMAPD ?! WE DO NOT WANT HER HERE! #SleazyLeach She is CLOSE ENOUGH to me, I could grab her myself!\n\nThe intense media attention and violent threats made it no longer possible for Ms. Maxwell to live a quiet life and required Ms. Maxwell to take more drastic steps to protect herself. Rather than see harmed by even more unwanted media attention, Ms. Maxwell made the difficult decision to separate herself and leave her home. As her spouse writes:\n\nThe \"reporting\" of Ghislaine over the past year has exploded exponentially. From the time of Epstein's arrest and death in custody in the summer of 2019 until Ghislaine's own arrest in July of this year, huge and increasingly frightening levels of media interest meant. There are many examples of violence whose seeds were born in conspiracy theories, and the experiences of QAnon, Pizzagate, and the recent Judge Salas attack are terrifying....\n\nIt is hard to communicate in words the feeling of being stalked, spied upon and trapped by constant, 24/7 media intrusion",
