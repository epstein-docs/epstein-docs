P. 12(b)(3)(A)(ii) which requires that motions to dismiss an indictment for pre-indictment delay be raised by pretrial motion. She respectfully requests, however, leave to supplement this motion after the government provides her with meaningful discovery. Depending on the status of the case after the disclosure of meaningful discovery, Ms. Maxwell may request that the Court defer ruling on this motion until after any trial if the indictment has not been dismissed on other grounds. See United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 326 (1971) (“Events of trial may demonstrate actual prejudice.”); United States v. Crouch, 84 F.3d 1497, 1516 (5th Cir. 1996) (except for “compelling cases, the district court, rather than grant such a motion prior to trial, should carry it with the case, and make the determination of whether actual, substantial prejudice resulted from the improper delay in light of what actually transpired at trial”; affirmed); United States v. Glist, 594 F.2d 1374 (10th Cir. 1979) (motions to dismiss for preindictment delay taken under advisement prior to trial and granted as to one of four counts after five days of trial).1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe claims made in the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) occurred approximately twenty-seven years ago. The world has changed significantly during the last three decades.\n\n1 See also, United States v. Scott, 579 F.2d 1013 (6th Cir. 1978) (motion to dismiss two counts of three-count indictment denied without prejudice prior to trial, granted after close of all the evidence, jury acquittal on remaining count; affirmed); United States v. Crabble, No. 16-40101-01-DDC, 2017 WL 4843295, at *1 (D. Kan.
