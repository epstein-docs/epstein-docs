Her renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court's concerns about the validity of waivers of extradition. (See Dkt. 106 at 13). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest extradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any incentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries. B. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets In denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms. Maxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could be used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at 17-18). To assuage any concerns that those assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell has taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are not used to secure the bond, while still allowing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for her spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes. 1. New Account All assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in escrow for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in the name of Ms. Maxwell's spouse (\"the Personal Account\")1, will be deposited in a newly created account (\"the New Account\") to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to order of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell's and her spouse's remaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale 1 The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell's Renewed Bail Application.
