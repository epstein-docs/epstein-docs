Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this letter motion seeking the Court's assistance with two critical issues that greatly impact Ms. Maxwell's ability to receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. First, we request that the Court enter an order directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment (\"Victims 1-3\"), subject to the restrictions of the protective order entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully investigate the alleged conduct, which is now over 25 years old. Second, we request that the Court enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") to release Ms. Maxwell into the general population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials while she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense. 1. Disclosure of Victim Identities The Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims 1-3 to defense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot prepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is authorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrowly-tailored and reasonable under the circumstances of this case. Here, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government's case is based on the accounts of Victims 1-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is therefore critical for the defense to know the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so DOJ-OGR-00001705",
