As noted in Mr. Epstein's bail submission, on advice of counsel, he has not yet provided a complete financial disclosure. Counsel's advice on this point was motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information provided to the Court. Mr. Epstein seeks leave to file his forthcoming supplemental disclosure under seal. As grounds and reasons therefor, Mr. Epstein relies on the exceptional amount of publicity that has been generated by this case, much of which relates specifically to his finances. Under the Bail Reform Act, financial information provided by a defendant to a pretrial services officer \"shall be used only for the purposes of a bail determination and shall otherwise be confidential.\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 3153(c)(1). Here, in the event Mr. Epstein is required to publicly file his financial statement, the information contained therein will inevitably be widely disseminated in the news media, contravening the statutory requirement of confidentiality.\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00000320",
