Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we plan to file a Renewed Motion for Release on Bail (the \"Motion\") and respectfully request an in camera conference, with all counsel present, to address the appropriate procedures for the filing and consideration of the Motion. For the reasons explained below, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.1(d), that the Court permit the filing of portions of the Motion and certain supporting materials under seal and require that any responsive materials be filed under seal. We believe an in camera conference would be the most efficient form to address these issues and other confidentiality concerns related to the Motion. We intend to provide a full set of materials to the government, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting that sensitive contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those that the government routinely requires in protective orders, including the one in this case. In the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell's request for bail and granted the government's motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial information that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive bail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell now seeks to renew her request for bail pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3142(f). Ms. Maxwell's renewed application will rely on sensitive and private information that, if made public, would be highly damaging to both Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including: Letters from Ms. Maxwell's family members and close friends, who have agreed to serve as sureties to support Ms. Maxwell's renewed bail application. The letters contain personal details that, if made public, would invite identification and DOJ-OGR-00001862",
