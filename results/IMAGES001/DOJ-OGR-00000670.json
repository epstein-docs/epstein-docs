She was cooperating in an FBI investigation and wanted the government to speak with her, and I thought that was going to be an easy task.\n2\n3 It was only a few months later that we learned that this investigation that was represented to my client in written form, that it would be a long investigation, and to be patient. Basically, to hang tight. It was resolved by way of a secret deal that never allowed any of the more than 30 victims who had been identified of Mr. Epstein's abuse in Florida to ever participate in a single hearing. There was a hearing. They were never notified.\n4\n5 I then went on to represent many of them in civil cases and also in extensive pro bono work. And I can tell your Honor that while Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of them hurt them and harmed them for many years, the feelings they had was aggravated exponentially by the facts that they had no rights in the criminal justice system, by the fact that they were treated as if they didn't matter. They were not allowed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act to meaningfully confer with prosecutors, to be treated with fairness, to be treated with dignity. That is what this is supposed to be about, and to have notice of hearings.\n6\n7 So I do want to thank your Honor, and especially the\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00000670",
