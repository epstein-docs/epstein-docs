She is not relying on them in connection with this bail application in an effort to safeguard their privacy and protect them and their families from harm.\n\nThe proposed bail conditions are consistent with those approved by courts in this Circuit in other high-profile cases, and should be approved here. See, e.g., United States v. Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (alleged leader of Genovese crime family who was charged with racketeering and extortion granted release subject to conditions), aff'd, 749 F. App'x 20 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 831, 832 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Marc Dreier, accused of \"colossal criminality\" and alleged to be a \"high flight risk,\" granted release subject to conditions); United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 240, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Bernie Madoff, charged with \"largest Ponzi scheme ever\" and alleged to be a \"serious risk of flight,\" granted release subject to conditions).\n\nnot have Ms. Maxwell's means, would be released on bail conditions. Accordingly, if the Court deems it necessary, it may impose private security guards as a condition of release.",
