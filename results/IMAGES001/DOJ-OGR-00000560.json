For one thing, it's some unverified list\n6 of assets, not audited, not certified, and not very detailed\n7 either.\n8 Mr. Epstein may be unusual, but there are no\n9 obligations, for example, no debts, no expenses. That,\n10 depending on if that's true -- maybe he's debt free and\n11 obligation free. But that would impact whatever the list of\n12 assets were if that were known too.\n13 It seems to me you have to know a -- there needs to be\n14 a fuller financial picture to know what would be appropriate.\n15 MR. WEINBERG: Let me be blunt.\n16 effort, and I am authorized to say to the Court that whatever\n17 bond you want Mr. Epstein to sign, whether it's $100 million or\n18 an amount close to the amount of the assets that we have\n19 provided, Mr. Epstein is prepared to sign it.\n20 He intends to appear.
