Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, NY 10007 November 23rd 2020 Your Honor: This statement is in support of Ghislaine Maxwell's request for bail and her character. My name is [REDACTED] I am resident in [REDACTED] I have known Ghislaine since 1979 when she was 18 years old, living at her family home in Oxford. At that time, when we first met, my first impression was the same as it remains now, that she is extraordinarily vivacious, friendly and intelligent. She has her father's charisma and has a genuine warmth. She was then diligently working for her final years of school exams to achieve her place at Oxford University, which she succeeded in. Throughout the last couple of years, she has been in touch as she was based in [REDACTED] joined a large family event hosted by Ghislaine and her husband in which she was very hospitable and obviously very much at home and in love. We all met her new family, and extended family, [REDACTED]. Prior to this, at various points in the lives of my children, as they have expressed a desire to see New York, Ghislaine has welcomed them, hosted them, and entertained them with friends and their children. At no time did I have any hesitation about them making those trips. The older children would have been in their early teens at that time. I recall when we all descended on her home in Manhattan in 2011. She was extremely busy with her philanthropic work that was very important to her regarding the Oceans and marine conservation, and her work took her to presentations at the UN and TED talks, I believe. It has been clear for many years that Ghislaine regards the US as her home, retaining her London house as a place to stay on return visits to see family and visit her mother (who [REDACTED] DOJ-OGR-00002039",
