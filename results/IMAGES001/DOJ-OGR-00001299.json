See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson's Form 13 PSR notes several instances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release. Doc. 188 at 8–10. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. Id. However, as the defense has pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson's probation revocations appear to have involved him absconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any convictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. Id.; see also Doc. 274 at 4–5.\n\nFinally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any person or the community by Mr. Robertson's release, the Court understands the government's concerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all charges until proven guilty, however. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j) (“Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson's innocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and has failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history of violent behavior.2 Nor is the Court persuaded by the government's vague suggestions that Mr. Robertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided no concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government's cryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case\n\n2 While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are therefore unproven allegations.
