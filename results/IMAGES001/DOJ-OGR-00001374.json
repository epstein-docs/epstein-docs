The court below erred in accepting the Government's conclusory proffer without any actual evidence. And the conditions of her confinement make it impossible for her to effectively prepare her defense. The Government concedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community, and her proposed bail package demonstrates that she is not a risk of flight. Accordingly, she should be released on bail.\n\nAt the very least, this matter should be remanded to the district court to conduct a real bail hearing to (1) test the actual strength of the Government's case, and (2) determine whether Ms. Maxwell should be granted temporary release so that she can effectively prepare for trial, which she cannot do under the current conditions of confinement.\n\nRelying almost entirely on a regurgitation of quotations from the lower court (the first 26 of the 43-paragraph pleading is labeled \"Facts\"), only ten paragraphs, labeled \"Discussion,\" even attempt to address Ms. Maxwell's arguments. As much as the Government would prefer that Ms. Maxwell not have a fair fight, this Court must level the playing field so\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-00001374",
