This is about many victims\n6 having lived in fear -- fear of the rich, the powerful, the\n7 famous, fear that the system will not afford them justice. So\n8 fear of not coming forward. And fear, of course, is a weapon\n9 that the rich, powerful, famous, and sexual predators used to\n10 silence the victims. But that is gone for a lot of victims\n11 because they refuse to suffer in silence.\n12 Finally, it does take courage to speak truth to power.\n13 We thank this honorable court for giving these victims a voice.\n14 We thank them, even after the death of the defendant, for\n15 showing respect for the victims, allowing them dignity,\n16 allowing them a voice. We do want truth, we do want justice,\n17 we do want accountability, and we do want those conspirators to\n18 face the justice system.\n19 Your Honor, right now we have two of our clients who\n20 would like to address the court.\n21 THE COURT: Sure.\n22 MS.
