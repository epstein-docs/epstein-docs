  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 38 Filed 08/10/20 Page 5 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 10, 2020\nPage 5\nfact that she, unlike Mr. Epstein, has never been suicidal and was never diagnosed as exhibiting risk factors for suicide. Her cell is searched multiple times a day and she has been forced to undergo numerous body scans. In addition, Ms. Maxwell's access to the standard prison resources available to other pretrial detainees in the general population has been extensively curtailed or eliminated altogether.\nThis treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell's Sixth Amendment right to participate in her defense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous discovery materials. Ms. Maxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes on them, and to discuss them with her attorneys. But there currently is no such structure in place. Indeed, although the government agreed that Ms. Maxwell would have access to a hard drive containing the discovery in the MDC, it is our understanding that the hard drive containing the first production has not yet been made available to Ms. Maxwell.\nDefense counsel understands that the BOP has proposed (but not yet implemented) a procedure that would permit Ms. Maxwell to use a computer on her floor to review discovery materials during the three-hour period each day that she is not confined to her cell. But there are two significant flaws in this proposal:\n- The three-hour period is specifically designated to be used by Ms. Maxwell for recreation, exercise, and personal hygiene, including showers. The BOP should not be permitted to force Ms. Maxwell to choose between maintenance of her physical and mental health and participating in her own defense.\n- Even if Ms. Maxwell were to forgo personal maintenance altogether, three hours a day is on its face an insufficient amount of time for reviewing documents in a complex case with voluminous document discovery, such as this one. As an illustration, the government's first set of production materials consists of nearly 13,000 pages of documents. Assuming it takes Ms. Maxwell an average of one minute to review each page of those materials, based on the BOP's proposed cap of three hours per day of review, Ms. Maxwell would conceivably finish reviewing this first set of documents at the earliest by mid-November 2020. This is entirely unworkable under the schedule set by the Court.\nMs. Maxwell does not seek special treatment at the MDC; but she does ask that she not be specially disfavored in her treatment in detention, especially when it comes to preparing her defense to conduct that allegedly took place over 25 years ago. In light of the voluminous discovery that we expect to receive, Ms. Maxwell would normally be spending 40 hours a week or more reviewing the discovery. Ms. Maxwell should be granted a comparable amount of time\nDOJ-OGR-00001709",
