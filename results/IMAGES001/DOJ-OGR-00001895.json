So to begin with, the government notified relevant victims or their counsel immediately following the arrest of the defendant on July 2 about the fact of the arrest and the initial presentment scheduled for later that day. In advance of the initial presentment, those victims were provided the opportunity to participate through the court's protocol for appearances in New Hampshire. On July 7, the court set a date for arraignment and bail hearing on July 14, today, and by the following day from the court's order, the government had notified relevant victims or their counsel of that scheduling order and advised victims and counsel of their right to be heard in connection with the bail hearing. On that same day, the government posted to its victim services website, including a link to the indictment, as well as scheduling information relating to the hearing. On July 9, the government updated the website to include the dial-in information that the court provided.
