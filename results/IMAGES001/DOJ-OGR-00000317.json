Indeed, it would be rank speculation by Petitioners to contend otherwise.\n\nHere, Petitioners have acknowledged that the best relief they can hope to obtain through these proceedings is the ability to confer with the attorneys for the government. See, e.g., July 11, 2008 Hr'g Tr. at 7 (agreeing that \"the best [Petitioners] can get\" is the \"right to confer\").\n\nYet, under the circumstances, a claim that Petitioners have been denied the opportunity to confer with the attorney for the government about the filing and disposition of criminal charges against Epstein is premature and constitutionally unripe. \"This is plainly the type of hypothetical case that [a court] should avoid deciding.\" Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc. v.

Any speculation by Petitioners that they might prospectively be denied the opportunity to confer with the government about still-legally-viable federal charges against Epstein simply cannot ripen Petitioners' claims. See id.

See, e.g., In re Jacks, 642 F.3d 1323, 1332 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that claims that are \"based on events that may take place in the future\" are to be \"dismissed for lack of jurisdiction\") (citing Greenbriar, Ltd. v.
