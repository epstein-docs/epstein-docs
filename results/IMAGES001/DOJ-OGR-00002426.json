The examiner asked Ms. Maxwell to \"list\" \"all the girls\" \"that you have met and brought\" \"to Jeffrey Epstein's house\" \"that were under the age of 18.\" This question lacked foundation as to time and place, was compound, requested speculation as to the age of a theoretical person, and asked for the witness' then-current ability to make a list from events that had happened nearly two decades previously. After an appropriate objection to this question, Ms. Maxwell admitted that she could not make a list. In response to the next, similar question, Ms. Maxwell and her lawyer objected to the word \"find,\" leading to the next request: This question is 12 DOJ-OGR-00002426",
