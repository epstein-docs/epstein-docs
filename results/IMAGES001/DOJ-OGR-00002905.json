Currently, the defendant's meals are heated in a thermal oven.\nThe tap water available in the MDC is provided by New York City. As a result, on occasions when the City has conducted maintenance near the MDC, the water has been temporarily shut off. During those periods, MDC staff have provided all inmates, including the defendant, with bottled water. After the water is turned back on, the water is sometimes cloudy or brown and needs to run for several seconds before becoming clear. MDC staff have not observed any instance in which the water in the defendant's cell did not clear after being run for several seconds. MDC legal counsel emphasized that MDC staff, including the legal staff, drink the same tap water from the same water system as the defendant while in the institution.\nMDC medical staff monitor the defendant daily and weigh the defendant at least once per week. During her time at the MDC, the defendant's weight has fluctuated between the 130s and the 140s. The defendant's lowest observed weight was 133 pounds in July of 2021. Since then, her weight has fluctuated but has never been lower than 134 pounds. Most recently, when the defendant was weighed last week, her weight was 137.5 pounds. The defendant is 5' 7\", meaning that even her lowest weight of 133 pounds resulted in a BMI of 20.8, which is considered a normal weight for a person of the defendant's height. MDC staff have not observed the defendant experience any noticeable hair loss. As noted above, the defendant has received a COVID-19 vaccine and is now fully vaccinated. In short, MDC medical staff assess that the defendant is physically healthy.\nDOJ-OGR-00002905",
