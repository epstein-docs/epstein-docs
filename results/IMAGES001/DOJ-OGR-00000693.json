I feel like we are conditioned to do that, and that's something that needs to change.\n2 So I'm here today, you know, I'm coming forward because it is time to bring light to that darkness, and it's time to replace that darkness with light. And I am a survivor of this, and I do aim to progress further from being a survivor, you know. I feel I've worked hard, quite hard, to get to where I'm at now, and I'm definitely at a place in my life where I will no longer cover up. I'll no longer cover up what needs to be brought to light.\n3 Jeffrey is no longer here, and the women that helped him are, Ghislaine Maxwell. My experience is with Ghislaine Maxwell and Sarah Kellen, and they definitely need to be held accountable for helping him, helping themselves, helping one another carry on this huge, almost like a system. So they need to be held accountable, all of them, and I would like to see that, certainly on behalf of myself and for everyone here.\n4 Thank you.\n5 THE COURT: Thanks so much.\n6 MS.
