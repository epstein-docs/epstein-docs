WEINGARTEN: We have had good conversations with\n3 the prosecutors, and we like and respect them. We are looking\n4 forward to getting discovery. We are interested to see whether\n5 the prosecutors in Florida, who are now under severe criticism\n6 10 years later, steered the alleged victims to New York,\n7 whether or not they violated their responsibilities under the\n8 NPA.\n9 THE COURT: Whether the federal prosecutors in Florida\n10 violated their terms and conditions?\n11 MR. WEINGARTEN: That will certainly be germane.\n12 THE COURT: Is that the point?\n13 MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes.\n14 THE COURT: Got it.\n15 MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, if I could very briefly\n16 respond to those points?\n17 THE COURT: Sure.\n18 MR. ROSSMILLER: I expect this will be briefed and\n19 argued on Thursday. I don't intend to go into extensive\n20 details about that. I just want to flag for the Court that\n21 defense counsel is saying that this conduct is ancient. What\n22 he is not saying is it is beyond the statute of limitations,\n23 because it is not.\n24 Second, the allegation that this is some kind of a\n25 conspiracy within the Department of Justice is just false.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00000393",
