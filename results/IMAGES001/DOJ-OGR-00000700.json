He stole Jennifer's childhood dreams, her innocence and her self-confidence. She was 14 years old. What he could not buy, he forcibly took. Why? Because he surrounded himself with a network of powerful people who not only looked the other way, but also actively facilitated and participated in his sexual abuse of children. Jeffrey Epstein thought he was above the law, and essentially he was until now. The system let Jennifer and the other victims down, but it does not have to end here. We ask the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI to bring all of Epstein's enablers and co-conspirators to justice. It has taken Jennifer 18 years to find her voice, and again, Jeffrey Epstein has tried to silence her. While she will never have her chance to face him in court, he no longer has any power over her. Today, this brave survivor will be heard. MS. AROZ: Thank you for allowing me to be able to have my chance in court today, to be able to tell you what this horrific man did to my life. You can't even imagine how much it affected my childhood, all the way through my adult life. He robbed me of my dreams. He robbed me of my chance to pursue a career I always adored. He stole my chance at really feeling love because I was so scared to trust anyone for so many years that I had such severe anxiety. I didn't want to leave my house let alone my bed.
