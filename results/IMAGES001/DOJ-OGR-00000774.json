Berman\nCase No: 19 CR 490 (RMB)\nPage 4\n\n5) Defer or Deny Without Prejudice if Safeguards Cannot Be Assured: If adequate safeguards cannot be implemented consistent with Rule 6(e), Pitch, and the CVRA, deny disclosure without prejudice.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy, or dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system is sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma. Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to the trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured profound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the years following. To now compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—especially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the letter and the spirit of the CVRA.\n\nThe CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point toward narrow tailoring, maximal privacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight. We respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nBradley Edwards\nBrittany Henderson\nEDWARDS HENDERSON\n425 North Andrews Avenue, Suite 2\nFort Lauderdale, Florida 33301\nTelephone: (954) 524-2820\nEmail: brad@cylf.com brittany@cylf.com\n\nPaul G.
