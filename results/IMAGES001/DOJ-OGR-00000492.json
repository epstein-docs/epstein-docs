A. The Court requested from the Defense all application materials that Mr. Epstein may have submitted to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, believing that the Department would not initiate the waiver of Mr. Epstein's sex offense registration on its own. No such materials have been received by the Court as of this date.\nThe Court understands that Mr. Epstein is also registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands (Level I) and in Florida (Level I). It has received no materials from the Defense regarding sex offender applications or proceedings in those two jurisdictions.\nIn sum, based upon all of the proffers and evidence set forth at pp. 10-21 above, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Epstein poses a danger to other persons and to the community.\nG. Mr. Epstein Also Poses A Risk Of Flight\nIn the section that follows, the Court considers \"risk of flight\" even though it has already determined that Mr. Epstein presents a danger to the community. \"[A] finding of either danger to the community or risk of flight will be sufficient to detain the defendant pending trial.\"\n21\nDOJ-OGR-00000492",
