That is 18 U.S.C. 3142(g).\n13       Now that the court has laid out the federal statutory\n14   requirements that guide its bail determination, it turns to the\n15   government's specific application in this case for detention\n16   pending trial.\n17       The government does not argue, as has been repeatedly\n18   made clear today, for detention based on danger to the\n19   community. Instead, it rests its argument for detention on\n20   Ms. Maxwell's alleged risk of flight. As noted in a\n21   flight-risk case, the government bears the burden of proving by\n22   a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant\n23   presents an actual risk of flight and that no condition or\n24   combination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant\n25   that would reasonably assure her presence in court.
