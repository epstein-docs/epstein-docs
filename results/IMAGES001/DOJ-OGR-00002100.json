In cases where the person appears before the court pursuant to a full extradition request, the judge must set a date for the extradition hearing to begin15. In provisional arrest cases, this date is set after the full request is served which, in US extradition cases, must be within 65 days of arrest16.\n7. At the extradition hearing, the appropriate judge must decide: (a) whether the extradition request meets certain technical requirements17; (b) whether the person appearing before the judge is the person whose extradition is requested18; (c) whether the offence(s) specified in the extradition request are extradition offence(s)19; (d) whether there are any bars to extradition20; (e) whether extradition would be compatible with the person's rights under the European Convention on Human Rights ('ECHR') within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 199821; and, where applicable, (f) whether extradition would be oppressive by reason of the person's mental or physical condition22.\n8.
