Id. Indeed, none of Mr. Epstein's alleged victims ever reported to the police they had met or spoken to Ms. Maxwell. Id.

The arrest warrant did not mention Ms. Maxwell and her name was never mentioned before the grand jury. Id. at 203, 211. No property belonging to Ms. Maxwell, including \"sex toys\" or \"child pornography,\" was seized from Mr. Epstein's home during execution of the search warrant. Id. at 257.

He confirmed he has no knowledge about Ms. Maxwell sexually trafficking anybody. Id. at 278-79. Detective Recarey was the individual from the Palm Beach Police Department who referred the Epstein case to the FBI in 2006. Detective Recarey entered Mr. Epstein's home in 2002 to install security cameras to catch a thief and did not observe any \"child pornography\" within the home, including on Mr. Epstein's desk in his office. Ex. B at 289-90. III. Lost and Missing Witnesses. The government alleges a three-year time frame for the allegations in the Indictment for acts purportedly occurring on Epstein properties in three states and another country.

None of the employees would have corroborated any of the allegations made in the Indictment. 11 DOJ-OGR-00002519",
