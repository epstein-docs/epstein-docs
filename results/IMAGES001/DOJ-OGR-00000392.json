WEINGARTEN: May I be heard briefly on that?\nTHE COURT: Sure.\nMR. WEINGARTEN: For us, your Honor, the NPA is the center of the universe for everything, search included, because the NPA was the result of an extensive 3-year investigation by law enforcement in Florida. In essence, the Feds made Mr. Epstein plead to a state offense and they declined prosecution federally, and that is translated in the NPA. Mr. Epstein did his time, Mr. Epstein is on the registration list, and Mr. Epstein paid the alleged victims.\nAs I am sure you have noted from the indictment, that conduct too is an ancient history. That conduct is 2002 to 2005. It is our belief that this is basically a re-do. This is basically the Feds today, not happy with what happened in the decision that led to the NPA, redoing the same conduct that was investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking. We think that is the heart of everything, and that will be the centerpiece of our defense, at least legally.\nTHE COURT: My understanding of what the government is asserting is that the episodes that occurred in Manhattan were not included in the nonprosecution agreement in Florida and that there is a separate basis not only for a sex trafficking\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
