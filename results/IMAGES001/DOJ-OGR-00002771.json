In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v.

Discussion\n\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent powers to review its own bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of the Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the Government’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions, which are currently pending before the Court. Id. at 7.
