This designation requires that Mr. Epstein report his presence in New York to law enforcement authorities every 90 days. As discussed at the July 15, 2019 bail hearing, counsel for Mr. Epstein made an application in New York State Supreme Court in 2011 to reduce Epstein's sex offender registration status from Level III to Level I. If granted, this reduction would have allowed Mr. Epstein to avoid his reporting obligations. In a Sex Offender Registration Act Hearing on January 11, 2018, held before the Honorable Ruth Pickholz, Mr. Epstein's application was (firmly) denied, principally because it had been established by the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders. See People v. Epstein, Indict. # 30129/2010, (N.Y. Sup. Ct.), SORA Hearing Transcript, dated Jan. 18, 2011.\n\nAt the hearing, New York County Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Gaffney joined in Defense Counsel's appeal to review and overturn the decision of the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders and achieve a downward modification of Mr. Epstein's sex offender status. Id. at 2-15. Judge Pickholz appeared to be stunned by the joint Defense Counsel/District Attorney application, stating: \"I am just a little overwhelmed that the People are making this application. . . I have done many SORAs much less troubling than this one where the People would never make a downward [adjustment] argument like this. . . . I have never seen the prosecutor's office do this. I have to tell you, I am shocked.\" Id. at 4-5. Judge Pickholz also ordered Mr. Epstein to report as a Level III sex offender every 90 days in New York. Id. at 12. \"I am sorry [Mr. Epstein] may have to come here every 90 days. He can give up his New York home [on East 71st. St.] if he does not want to come every 90 days.\" Id. Epstein appealed but Judge Pickholz's decision\n\n19\n\nDOJ-OGR-00000490",
