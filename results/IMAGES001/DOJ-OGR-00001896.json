One victim's views are expressed in the government's reply\n6 memorandum; one victim has submitted a statement to the government and asked that the government read it during today's\n7 proceedings; and one victim has asked to be heard directly, and the government anticipates that she will make a statement at\n8 any time during this proceeding as necessitated by the court.\n9 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.\n10 Then, with that, returning to the schedule that you have laid out, and I thank counsel for conferring in advance,\n11 as to a proposed schedule, Mr. Cohen, let me just finalize if you agree to the proposed schedule that has been laid out by\n12 Ms. Moe and supplemented by you?\n13 MR.
