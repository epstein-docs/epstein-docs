When FBI agents arrived at the defendant's remote property in New\nHampshire on the morning of July 2, 2020, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate.

Through a\nwindow, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shutting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house.
