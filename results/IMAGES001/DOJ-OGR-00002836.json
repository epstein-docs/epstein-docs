Systematic Exclusion\n\nApart from the second Duren element, Schulte's fair cross-section challenge must also fail because he cannot meet the third element: systematic exclusion, which requires a showing that the \"underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\" Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\n\nIn Rioux, the Second Circuit explained that there is \"systematic exclusion when the underrepresentation is due to the system of jury selection itself, rather than external forces.\" 97 F.3d at 658. Under the external forces principle, outside causes of underrepresentation (such as \"demographic changes\") do not constitute systematic exclusion. Id.; see, e.g., Schanbarger v. Macy, 77 F.3d 1424 (2d Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (jury selection process \"drawn from voter registration lists\" did not constitute systematic exclusion); United States v. Little Bear, 583 F.2d 211, 414-15 (8th Cir. 1978) (\"inclement weather\" in North Dakota that allegedly led to the underrepresentation of rural jurors was not systematic exclusion); United States v.
