NATHAN, United States District Judge:\n\nThis Order is entered, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(f) and the Due Process Protections Act, Pub. L. No 116–182, 134 Stat. 894 (Oct. 21, 2020), to confirm the Government’s disclosure obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny, and to summarize the possible consequences of violating those obligations.\n\nThe Government must disclose to the defense all information “favorable to an accused” that is “material either to guilt or to punishment” and that is known to the Government. Id. at 87. This obligation applies regardless of whether the information would itself constitute admissible evidence.\n\nThe Government shall disclose such information to the defense promptly after its existence becomes known to the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the information in the preparation of its case.\n\nAs part of these obligations, the Government must disclose any information that can be used to impeach the trial testimony of a Government witness within the meaning of Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), and its progeny. Such information must be disclosed sufficiently in advance of trial in order for the defendant to make effective use of it at trial or at such other time as the Court may order.\n\nThe foregoing obligations are continuing ones and apply to materials that become known to the Government in the future. Additionally, if information is otherwise subject to disclosure, it must be disclosed regardless of whether the Government credits it.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00001816",
