  "full_text": "Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 54 of 74 54 eloquently. I've heard the government in different venues, including this one, talk about extraordinary risks of flight and extraordinary danger and to diminish the persuasiveness of the set of combination of conditions. Madoff was released on bail. He surrendered. Dryer called the colossal fraud by Judge Rakoff -- he surrendered and went to jail. Mr. Skilling from the Enron fame went to jail for 24 years. I recently had a case with Judge Furman where the government was arguing for detention that were associated with somebody in a different country. And he granted bail over detention, and those defendants came to court and were sentenced and went to jail. I'm sure there are examples that the government here can point to that certain people that can't comply with conditions. But an enormous amount of people facing detention requests honor their obligations, particularly when conditions are set such as the conditions that Mr. Weingarten, Mr. Fernich, and I have just mentioned to the Court. THE COURT: Of the cases you just mentioned, were any of them presumption cases like this one? MR. WEINBERG: I can't say they are, your Honor, but I do believe that presumption becomes just a factor when the burden of production is negated by in this case the 14 years of non danger to the community and the danger prong and by SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
