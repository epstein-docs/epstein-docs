While Congress amended the statute in 2003 to extend the time in which a prosecution could be brought to within the life of the victim, 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (2003), Accuser-3 reached the age of 25 in , and thus the statute of limitations as to her had expired before the time of the amendment. While Ms. Maxwell contends that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively at all, and is inapplicable in any event,5 it is black-letter law that retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations to revive a time-barred claim would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607, 618 (2003). Thus, there can be no prosecution for any conduct alleged as to Accuser-3.\n\nB. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged Conspiracies.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice or cause one or more individuals to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Because, as shown above, the allegations in the indictment are insufficient to allege such a conspiracy as to Accuser-3, the only individuals as to whom the indictment even arguably alleges such a conspiracy are Accuser-1 and Accuser-2. The allegations regarding Accuser-3, however, have nothing to do with any conspiracy as to Accuser-1 or Accuser-2.\n\nWhile the government couches the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 as \"overt acts\" in furtherance of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Three, they are not.
