I'll note that in light of the court's order indicating that the victims and their counsel would be permitted to be heard in court here today, the government has endeavored to provide notice to all known victims of today's proceeding. We did so either directly where a victim was not represented by counsel or through counsel where a victim is represented by an attorney.\nThe government does not know exactly how many victims or their attorneys are here today and we do not know how many of them or their counsel would like to speak. To the extent any individuals do wish to speak, we do not know the substance of what they would like to say. We have left that entirely up to the individual decisions of the victims and their attorneys.\nI will note, though, that throughout this case, the government has endeavored and done our utmost to fulfill our obligations under the Crimes Victims' Rights Act. We have done so by trying to keep as many victims as we are aware of up to date about the ongoing case and about any developments in the case.\nWe will continue to provide services and offer services to any of the victims in this case, even after the indictment is dismissed. Both the U.S. Attorney's office and the FBI have been in touch with all known victims or have attempted to be in touch with all known victims, either again directly where victims are not represented by counsel or\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00000650",
