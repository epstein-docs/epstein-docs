And we were in the middle of discovery, and we had situations in which we had witnesses who were cooperating with us and then were contacted by either Mr. Epstein or his lawyers and who then stopped cooperating with us. So I thought the Court ought to have that piece of information.\nTHE COURT: So that sort of supports the idea that payments were made or at least the inference that one could draw to keep people silent.\nMR. BOIES: Yes. I don't personally know to whom they were made, and I have been given no explanation as to why they were made.\nWhat I do know is that this was a time when we had intensive evidence to take depositions and discovery and interview present and former employees of Mr. Epstein.\nWe had experience where if we contacted somebody and we actually had some conversations with them, then Mr. Epstein would get them a lawyer, and they would stop cooperating. That proceeding was still going on at the time that these payments were made.\nIf I could just introduce you to Annie Farmer who is one of our clients who would just like to speak very briefly to the Court.\nTHE COURT: Sure.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00000581",
