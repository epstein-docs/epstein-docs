It bears emphasis that Maxwell's appeal ostensibly concerns a motion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant only insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial. As this Court previously recognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability to prepare for trial is through an application to the District Court. Maxwell availed herself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC's security protocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial. Tellingly,\n\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during the course of this case. It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that Maxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband items to cover her eyes. The Government conveyed the MDC's imprecise language in an April 6, 2021 letter to Judge Nathan but has since recognized and acknowledged the inaccuracy. The remaining accusations, however, are unfounded. For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel's statement at oral argument about nighttime checks being \"routine\" out of context when claiming that it involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every 15 minutes. To the contrary, when asked whether the nighttime checks were conducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, \"I can't speak to what is done as to all inmates.\" Only after conferring with the MDC did the Government convey to Judge Nathan, and now this Court, the MDC's procedures for nighttime checks of all inmates. The Government has and will continue to accurately represent the information it receives from the MDC when necessary to respond to Maxwell's complaints or inquiries from the Court.\n\n19\nDOJ-OGR-00001459",
