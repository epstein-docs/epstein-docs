Statement of Jane Doe 8.\n3 In the past few weeks, I have had to reflect on my interaction with Jeffrey Epstein and realized that, though I have yet to put it all behind me, I am still a victim. I say this because I have to come to terms with it in an effort to truly get past the abuse I suffered at the hands of Epstein.\n4 Pursuing criminal penalties against him and having an opportunity to address the egregious crimes he committed against me and other young woman would have helped my recovery process. This all came to an abrupt halt when he took his own life. This point of disclosure is lost.\n5 I cannot say that I am pleased he committed suicide, but I am at peace knowing he will not be able to hurt anyone else. However, a sad truth remains. I, along with other people, will never have an answer as to why. I will never have an apology for the wrongdoing. And most importantly, Epstein will not be justly sentenced for his crimes. Now I sit in my home questioning the well-being of those girls like myself. In choosing death, Epstein denied everyone justice.\n6 Any efforts made to protect Epstein's name and legacy send a message to the victims that he wins and that he is untouchable. I understand his case may be dismissed or closed, but this makes me feel as though I, and anyone else who fell pry to his hands, simply do not matter.\n7 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
