Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nMay 5, 2021\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's Order dated April 29, 2021, which directed the Government to confer with legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\") regarding the use of flashlights in security checks at MDC. (Dkt. No. 257). The Government has conferred with legal counsel at MDC in accordance with the Court's Order, and legal counsel provided the information set forth herein.\nMDC staff conduct flashlight checks at night as a matter of course throughout the facility for the safety and security of the inmates at the institution. During these flashlight checks, MDC staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that the inmate is present in the cell, breathing, and not in distress. MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every 30 minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit (the \"SHU\") and conduct flashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at irregular intervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\nWith respect to the defendant, MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes because the defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule. That is\nDOJ-OGR-00001435",
