Mr. Cohen, based on the government's description of both the quantity and quality of\n9    discovery, is that schedule that's been laid out sufficient from your perspective to do everything that you need to do?\n10\n11    MR. COHEN: Your Honor, just two points in that regard. I think counsel for the government did not mention in\n12    the e-mail we had sent to your Honor's law clerk that August 21\n13    would be the deadline for production of search warrant\n14    applications and the subpoena returns. I think she just failed\n15    to mention it for the record. That would also be part of the\n16    schedule.\n17\n18    THE COURT: Thank you.\n19    Ms. Moe, do you agree?\n20    MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. I apologize.\n21    We did include that in the e-mail to your Honor's chambers, and\n22    that is correct.\n23    And thank you, counsel, for clarifying that.\n24    MR. COHEN: Two additional points, your Honor. The trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to\n25\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00001893",
