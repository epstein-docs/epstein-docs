Mr. Weingarten, under the Bail Reform Act you are entitled to a continuance of three days, which I guess would take us to Thursday.\nMR. WEINGARTEN: Right.\nTHE COURT: The other alternative, I guess, if you want to de facto extend that three days is consent to detention without prejudice.\nMR. WEINGARTEN: We estimated that by Thursday we could get you something in writing and then appear back before you at your convenience.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Do you want to schedule it -- well, I think Thursday's proceedings right now would be in front of Judge Berman unless he wants to send it back to me for bail, but do you want to put this down for detention hearing on Thursday?\nMR. WEINGARTEN: Can I make one point that I don't want to forget that I think is extremely important?\nTHE COURT: Go ahead.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
