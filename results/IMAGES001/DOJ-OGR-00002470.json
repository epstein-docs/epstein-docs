The documents at issue here were submitted in connection with discovery motions decided by Judge Sweet. The Court concludes that they are judicial documents to which the presumption of public access attaches.\n\nAs with the documents that the Court ordered unsealed in July, however, the motions at issue today are, as noted, discovery motions. Accordingly, the presumption of public access is somewhat less weighty than for a dispositive motion. It is, nevertheless, important to the public's interest in monitoring federal courts' exercise of their Article III powers that the public review the documents.\n\nWith this presumption of public access in mind, the Court turns to the countervailing interests at stake. The Court has considered the arguments advanced by the parties in their briefing. It has also considered the submission from intervenors Julie Brown and the Miami Herald Media Company. The Court has also received submissions from various Does, in addition to Does 1 and 2, who are under consideration now.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
