I was, of course, aware of Ghislaine's previous relationship with Epstein, a person I have never met nor had any communication. The media coverage of Epstein is very different today than it was 8. The \"reporting\" of Ghislaine over the past year has exploded exponentially. From the time of Epstein's arrest and death in custody in the summer of 2019 until Ghislaine's own arrest in July of this year, huge and increasingly frightening levels of media interest meant There are many examples of violence whose seeds were born in conspiracy theories, and the experiences of QAnon, Pizzagate, and the recent Judge Salas attack are terrifying. Twitter comments have been particularly galling, There are many other gross and disgusting posts like this on the web that a simple search will bring up. I have also received threatening messages through social media, which I have reported and blocked. It is hard to communicate in words the feeling of being stalked, spied upon and trapped by constant, 24/7 media intrusion At one point, The Sun even put a \"bounty\" on her head. 2 | Page DOJ-OGR-00002020",
