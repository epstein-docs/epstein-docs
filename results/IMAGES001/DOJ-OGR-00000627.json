Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nAugust 19, 2019\n\nVIA ECF\n\nThe Honorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n500 Pearl Street\nNew York, New York 10007\n\nRe: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nAs the Court is aware, on the morning of August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein died while in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. On August 16, 2019, and after conducting an autopsy, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York issued a statement identifying the cause of death as hanging, and the manner of death as suicide. In light of the death of the defendant prior to a conviction becoming final, the Government must request the Court approve the attached proposed order of nolle prosequi.\n\nConsistent with our practice throughout this case and our obligations under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, the Government has made efforts to contact all identified victims since learning of the death of the defendant and will similarly notify all known victims of the attached order, once entered. As this Office has previously stated publicly, it remains committed to doing its utmost to stand up for the victims who have already come forward, as well as for the many others who have yet to do so.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nGEOFFREY S. BERMAN\nUnited States Attorney\n\nBy: ______________________________\nAlison Moe / Alex Rossmiller / Maurene Comey\nAssistant United States Attorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (212) 637-2225 / 2415 / 2324\n\nCc: All counsel of record (Via ECF)\n\nDOJ-OGR-00000627",
