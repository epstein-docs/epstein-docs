  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-21 Filed 12/14/20 Page 19 of 29\n\nAnnex B - CV of David Perry QC\n\n1. David Perry QC\n1.1. David Perry QC is a barrister and former head of chambers at 6KBW College Hill. From 1991 to 1997, he was one of the Standing Counsel to the Department of Trade and Industry. From 1997 to 2001, he was Junior Treasury Counsel to the Crown at the Central Criminal Court and Senior Treasury Counsel from 2001 until 2006, when he 'took silk' (i.e. was appointed Queen's Counsel). He is a deputy High Court Judge and a judge of the Court of Appeal of Jersey and Guernsey.\n1.2. Mr Perry prosecutes and defends and has extensive experience of extradition and mutual legal assistance cases, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. He is a member of the Editorial Board of the Criminal Law Review and a joint editor of Blackstone's Criminal Practice, a leading practitioners' work.\n\n2. Extradition - Experience and Expertise\n2.1. Mr Perry is widely considered one of the UK's pre-eminent extradition practitioners and is listed as such in the leading industry journals. He has acted on behalf of many overseas governments and appeared in the High Court, House of Lords and Supreme Court in the leading cases. He has acted as an expert consultant to the Commonwealth Secretariat on international co-operation and has advised overseas governments on the drafting and implementation of their domestic legislation.\n\n3. Independent review of the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements\n3.1. In 2011/12, together with Lord Justice Scott Baker and Anand Doobay, Mr Perry was appointed by the UK Government to conduct the Home Office's Independent Review of the UK's extradition arrangements. The review formed the basis of changes to the Extradition Act 2003.\n3.2. The year-long review looked in detail at the following five areas:\n- the Home Secretary's discretionary powers to stop extradition.\n- the operation of the European Arrest Warrant, which deals with extradition requests between European countries.\n- where a crime is mainly committed in the UK, whether the person should be tried in the UK.\n- whether the US-UK Extradition Treaty is unbalanced.\n- whether requesting countries should be required to provide sufficient evidence to prove an allegation.\n3.3. The report, totalling 488 pages and presented to the Home Secretary on 30 September 2011, made a series of recommendations in respect of the UK's extradition arrangements. Part 7 of the report looked specifically at extradition arrangements between the United States and United Kingdom under the 2003 UK-US Treaty on Extradition. It assessed the effectiveness of the tests used in each jurisdiction and laid out the authors' observations on the procedures under the treaty. Their conclusion was that the 2003 treaty was operating fairly and there was no basis to seek its renegotiation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00002114",
