The Government respectfully submits that a limited number of additional redactions would be appropriate with respect to Motion 3 in order to be consistent with the other redactions proposed by the defendant in that particular motion. The Government will submit those additional proposed redactions under seal by email.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Attorney\n\nBy: s/\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz / Andrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Attorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (212) 637-2324\n\nCc: All counsel of record, by email\n\nDOJ-OGR-00002336",
