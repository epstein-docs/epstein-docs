We can address them in one setting in some manner. Then we wouldn't have to be in each round redacting and paying attention to people who have no objection on the file.\nTHE COURT: Ms. Menninger, anything else?\nMS. MENNINGER: I just think there is a big difference between people who have not objected affirmatively, like Professor Dershowitz, and those from whom we have heard nothing or received back no confirmation that they received the notice from the Court. I think we need to treat those groups differently.\nWith respect to people who affirmatively want their name out there, fine, I have no problem. For those who have not just simply not responded, we know for the half that we served, in approximately half of the cases we never received, despite a return receipt requested, any confirmation that they actually received the notice.\nMR. KRIEGER: Your Honor, if I may have a brief minute to respond.\nTHE COURT: Yes, sir.\nMR.
