Furthermore, because I couldn't tell anyone, out of fear of judgment, blame or retaliation, keeping this secret completely hindered my ability to uncover why these issues existed for me, which could have led to a path of healing over the years. It is time for those of power to do the right thing. It is time for compassion toward our fellow human beings to reign over money, power and greed. We need to protect our most vulnerable to allow them a chance at a normal life, and nothing should come in the way of that. I believe that for future generations, including my own children, this case will set a precedent that victims must no longer suffer in silence on our own or be shamed for coming forward to seek protection. This case should demonstrate to those who want to harm others that there will be a reckoning, and they will pay dearly for the harm they inflict on innocent people. Judge Berman, I thank you for from the bottom of my heart for this forum and opportunity. To all of those survivors who came before me, I commend your bravery. There is no way I could have done this without you. Thank you to the public following this story, for your outrage and desire for answers, which will hopefully move this case forward so that victims can stop having to relive their SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
