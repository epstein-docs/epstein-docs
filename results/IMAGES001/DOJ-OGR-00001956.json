Thank you, your Honor. THE COURT: All right. Thank you, counsel. I am prepared to make my ruling. Several provisions of federal law govern the court's determination whether to detain the defendant or release her on bail pending trial. A court must apply that law equally to all defendants no matter how high profile the case or well off the defendant. It is therefore important to begin here with a clear articulation of the governing law. It is also important to bear in mind that Ms. Maxwell, like all defendants, is entitled to a full presumption of innocence, that is, she is presumed innocent and the only grounds for detention at this stage are, under the law, risk of flight or danger to the community. I may consider the weight of the evidence proffered by the government at this stage in making this determination, but unless this matter is resolved by a plea, it will remain entirely for a jury to decide the question of Ms. Maxwell's guilt as to the charges contained in the indictment. Turning to the government's standard under Title 18 of SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00001956",
