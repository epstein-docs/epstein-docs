This high level of political integration existing between the Member States of the European Union goes hand in hand with a certain homogeneity within these States in terms of the scale of penalties as well as in terms of adjustment of penalty methods; the member states being bound by the same international obligations (in particular the obligations arising from the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights).\n\nIn any event, the principle of non-extradition of nationals is a principle of extradition law from which France has never deviated outside the framework of the European Union.\n\nOffice for the International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters\n\nPhilippe JAEGLE\n[signature]\n\nDOJ-OGR-00002203",
