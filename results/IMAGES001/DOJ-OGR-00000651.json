We have expressed to them that services are available for those who wish to take advantage of them. Unless the court has any questions for me, the government will otherwise rest on its papers. THE COURT: I just have one question. The protective order, is that self-executing or do I need to do something? MS. COMEY: It is self-executing, your Honor. THE COURT: Thanks very much, Ms. Comey. MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor. THE COURT: Yes. I'll turn to counsel for the defense at this time. Mr. Weingarten, I'm happy to hear from you. MR. WEINGARTEN: Thank you. Your Honor, I think it is an understatement of the year to say the world looks and feels differently today than it did the last time I was before you. For us, the elephant in the room is what happened to our client. I would like to tell you how we see the world and where we are on that subject. We start with the Attorney General's statements, public statements, that there were very serious improprieties in the jail. We obviously read the press. We see that the warden has been taken out. We see that the guards on duty at the time have been put on leave. We understand guards are SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00000651",
