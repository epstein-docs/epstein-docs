  "full_text": "who are already suffering without her presence, and she would cause financial ruin to herself and her closest family and friends.\n1. Ms. Maxwell is Devoted to Her Spouse and Would Never Destroy Her Family By Leaving the Country\nThe letter submitted by Ms. Maxwell's spouse powerfully demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell has deep roots in the United States and is not a flight risk. The letter describes Ms. Maxwell's domestic life with her spouse in the four years prior to her arrest. Her spouse describes Ms. Maxwell as a \"wonderful and loving person,\" who does not remotely resemble the person depicted in the indictment. (Ex. A ¶ 4). Contrary to the government's assertion that Ms. Maxwell lived a rootless, \"transient\" lifestyle (Dkt. 4 at 9), Ms. Maxwell lived a quiet family life with her spouse until Epstein's arrest in July 2019 ignited a media frenzy that has ripped the family apart.\nThe person described in the criminal charges is not the person we know. I have never witnessed anything close to inappropriate with Ghislaine; quite to the contrary, the Ghislaine I know is a wonderful and loving person.\nUntil the explosion of media interest that followed the arrest and subsequent death in custody of Jeffrey Epstein in July thru August 2019.\n(Id. ¶¶ 4-5).\nThe letters from Ms. Maxwell's family members similarly describe how Ms. Maxwell's home is in the United States with her spouse and how deeply committed she is to her family. See Ex. D",
