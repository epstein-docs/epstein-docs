Discussion\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan's bail determinations and denied Maxwell's application for pretrial release.

As an initial matter, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket a new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her \"renewed motion\" under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively asking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent this motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 40(a)(1) and Local Rules 40.1 and 40.2.\n30.
