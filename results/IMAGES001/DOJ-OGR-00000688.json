Your remarks today, I think, should be published so that they can serve as a guide for other judges around the country. I would encourage you to add into your remarks a reference to the Crime Victims Rights Act. The Crime Victims Right Act promises victims the right to be treated with fairness, dignity and respect, and the process that we see unfolding this morning is a clear example of how victims can be treated with fairness, dignity and respect. So I know that your Honor is wondering what is the appropriate action here. Unfortunately, it seems like there are no other legal options, but there was a legal option for you to decide to exercise, which was to allow these victims to come forward. And if there's been one positive thing that has come out of the tragedies, the abuse, the other events of this case, it's been your decision to allow these victims to be heard this morning, and I encourage you to publish your decision and to encourage other judges to follow what is clearly a model for crime victims rights and is clearly an example that should be followed in other cases down the road. THE COURT: Thank you very much. I appreciate your being here. I had no idea that you would be here when I wrote the remarks, but it was clear from the literature that you are SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00000688",
