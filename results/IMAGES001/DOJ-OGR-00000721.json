I emersed myself into my studies and was accepted to every college I applied to, graduating from a top university. To this day, there is still an ache in my being that I did not apply to Harvard in fear of his influence there. They say you never forget your first. I'm in a never-ending nightmare trying to do just that. I'm forever suffering because everything reminds me of that horror. This new wave of worldwide publicity only worsens my despair. It was only many years later that I was finally intimate with a man again, and those moments were marred by my actions as a child with Jeffrey Epstein. Even now is impossible to separate his treachery from any care of a good man. For one brief moment there was elation when he was recently arrested. I would finally get my chance to see him again face to face and show him what I had become, that I had succeeded on my own, that I was worth something in spite of his abuse, and that I had surmounted the monumental obstacles he laid before me throughout my entire life since falling prey to him. I had hoped humanity would prevail, but it seems to me that he outsmarted everyone so far, and his ghost is still laughing at us. I appeal to all of those just and true that his evil legacy and his death not stand in the way of SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00000721",
