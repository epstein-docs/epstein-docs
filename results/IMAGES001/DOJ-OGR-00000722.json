And then just one last one, and this is much shorter. Statement of Jane Doe, also my client. I was a model in another country when I came to the United States. I was told by a broker that I needed to meet with a man named Jeffrey Epstein, who was the owner of Victoria's Secret. The broker told me that Mr. Epstein could help me get into Victoria Secret's world. It was my childhood dream to be a Victoria's Secret model. So I went one day in the afternoon and I met Mr. Epstein in his office in his mansion in New York. A woman introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would probably have photographers shooting photos of me right away. The told me to go upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein had a white robe on and we chatted very briefly. I had my portfolio of photos, but he didn't even look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and got close to me. I got up to leave, but the door was locked. I didn't know what was going on. It was my first official meeting to be cast in the United States. I was a young girl and confused. He got very close to me, and I had a skirt on. He started to touch my genitals. I refused him. Then he went to the massage table and showed me the vibrator.
