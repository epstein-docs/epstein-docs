Ms. Maxwell is not alleged, however, to have enticed or otherwise caused either Accuser-2 or Accuser-3 to travel.\n\nMs. Maxwell's interactions with Accuser-3 allegedly took place entirely in London, England, where Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have \"groomed and befriended\" Accuser-3 \"between approximately 1994 and 1995.\" Id. ¶ 7c. Ms. Maxwell allegedly introduced Accuser-3 to Epstein and arranged for \"multiple interactions between [Accuser-3] and Epstein,\" during which Ms. Maxwell \"encouraged [Accuser-3] to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage in sex acts with [Accuser-3] during those massages.\" Id.\n\nAlthough the indictment alleges that Epstein \"sexually abused\" Accuser-3 during the massages (id.), it does not allege that Epstein's interactions with Accuser-3 were nonconsensual or in violation of any English law. Notably, Ms. Maxwell is not alleged to have met Accuser-3 and introduced her to Epstein until 1994 at the earliest, by which time Accuser-3 had reached age 163—the legal age of consent in England. Sexual Offences Act 2003 § 9 (Eng.), 2003, c. 42. Thus, it appears that the \"sexual abuse\" of Accuser-3 that the indictment alleges was lawful conduct.\n\nNor does the indictment allege any travel by Accuser-3, in interstate or foreign commerce or otherwise, let alone as a result of any action taken by Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else.\n\nYet Counts One and Three allege that Ms. Maxwell's encouragement of Accuser-3 to provide massages to Epstein in the future was somehow an overt act in furtherance of the alleged\n\n3 The government has disclosed that Accuser-3 was born in _______.",
