If counsel feel that additional time is required to guarantee those constitutional rights, Ms. Maxwell will suffer the consequence by her continued detention. The Court has the power - and, indeed, the discretion - to accommodate this constitutional clash. Granting a continuance and releasing Ms. Maxwell on the most restrictive conditions of home detention. Surely, the Court can impose conditions that \"clip her wings\" and satisfy perceived flight concerns without keeping Ms. Maxwell locked in a BOP cage.\n\nAs counsel has notified the government, Ms. Maxwell is requesting an in-person arraignment. She will not waive that right, most especially in light of media coverage and the debacle that occurred during a remote proceeding in a related civil case before Judge Preska. In addition, Ms. Maxwell is requesting a bail hearing at which witnesses will testify regarding the purported strength of the government's case. Further, we request that these proceedings be scheduled to coincide with an evidence review session at the U.S. Attorney's Office to be attended by Ms. Maxwell with counsel.\n\nYour consideration is greatly appreciated.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBobbi C. Sternheim\nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM\n\ncc: All counsel\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-00002886",
