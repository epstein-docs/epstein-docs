  "full_text": "Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 53 Filed 09/03/19 Page 75 of 86 75 J8RsEPS3 cannot eat at the thought of Jeffrey Epstein not serving the time he needed to realize the pain and suffering he caused so many vulnerable young girls. He thought he was untouchable, and honestly, so did I. I thought he was the most powerful person I would ever meet. But the end is here and here I stand becoming more powerful than he will ever be. Thank you. THE COURT: Thank you. JANE DOE: Jane Doe. Um, in 2004, when I was 15 years old, I flew on Jeffrey Epstein's plane to Zorro Ranch, where I was sexual molested by him for many hours. What I remember most vividly was him explaining to me how beneficial the experience was for me and how much he was helping me to grow. Yikes. I remember feeling so small and powerless, especially after he positioned me by laying me on his floor so that I was confronted by all the framed photographs on his dresser of him smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians. After he finished with me, he told me to describe in detail how good my first sexual experience felt. That was the first of many lies I was forced to carry for him, the weight of which proliferated my trauma. I felt powerless not merely because one man wanted to strip me of my innocence, but because I was the victim of a system that just enfranchises human beings, making them vulnerable to pedophilic exploitation.
