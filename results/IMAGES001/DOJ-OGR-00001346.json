Receipt of the letter was acknowledged, but to date there has been no response and little, if any, redress to the most serious conditions. Upon information and belief, decisions concerning Ms. Maxwell's specialized detention are made by Warden Tellez, or from others outside the MDC. A report from the MDC Legal Department would provide second-hand information. Accordingly, Warden Tellez should be directed to provide a first-hand accounting to the Court and counsel why Ms. Maxwell is being detained under such individualized conditions. Your consideration is greatly appreciated.
