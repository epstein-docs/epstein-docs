For years before her arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had gotten away with her crimes. That illusion has now been shattered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources to flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct, including some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has been and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media. As alleged in the Indictment, in 2016, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address her conduct with minors in the context of a civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course, the subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to protect herself.
