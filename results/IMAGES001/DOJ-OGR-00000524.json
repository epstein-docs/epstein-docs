And that additional\n\nevidence builds on a case that was already indicted by a grand\n\njury, that already included evidence of dozens of alleged\n\nvictims, that already included significant corroborated\n\nevidence, evidence that led to the charges for which this\n\n66-year-old defendant could serve up to 45 years in prison.\n\nThe defendant has essentially conceded that the\n\ngovernment will be able to prove the elements of the crimes\n\ncurrently alleged. They acknowledged in their submission that\n\nthe government likely will be able to show that the defendant\n\nengaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were under\n\nage.\n\nNow, in the face of all of this evidence and the\n\nextraordinary incentives for the defendant to flee, what does\n\nthe defendant propose? Nothing that would meaningfully\n\nmitigate the risks of danger and especially flight.\n\nTHE COURT: Are you talking about the bail package\n\nnow?\n\nMR.
