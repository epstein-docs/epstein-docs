The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concludes that \"no condition\nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1).\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allows the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if \"information exists that was not known to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue\" of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v.

In addition, the Court may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3142(f)'s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v.
