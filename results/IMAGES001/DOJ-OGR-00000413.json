He is charged with appalling crimes, and those charges are supported by significant evidence, including victim and witness testimony and damning record evidence. He faces the very real prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. He has every motivation in the world to flee, and he has the means to do it.\nAnd I will note for the court that this is a case where the government has really put its money where its mouth is on the risk of flight. This district took extraordinary efforts to maintain the covert status of its investigation for many months due to the risk of flight of the defendant -- not a single media report, not a single public statement, no appeals for victims to come forward because of precisely the flight risks we are discussing now.\nTurning to the characteristics of the defendant, your Honor, some individuals who face significant charges lack the means to flee. Not this defendant. As set forth in the government's submission, in the defendant's most recent sex offender registration, he lists six residences worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, including a residence abroad.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
