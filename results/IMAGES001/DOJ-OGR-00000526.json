ROSSMILLER: I suppose that's true, your Honor.\nBased on the government's preliminary research, it seems like they wouldn't be able to, but we have no idea. That's exactly right.\nThe defendant's proposal of home confinement and electronic monitoring is also meaningless for an individual with his financial resources. Reducing this defendant's head start in fleeing should be of no comfort whatsoever.\nIn connection with that factor, your Honor, just this morning, the government became aware that in a locked safe in the defendant's mansion there were piles of cash, dozens of diamonds, and a passport appearing to be issued from a foreign country with a photo of the defendant and a name on that passport that is not the defendant's name.\nTHE COURT: Say that again.\nYou found that today?\nMR. ROSSMILLER: We became aware of it today. It was seized in connection with a warrant, and we became aware of it just this morning, the particular details this morning.\nTHE COURT: When you say \"piles of cash,\" did you count it?\nMR.
