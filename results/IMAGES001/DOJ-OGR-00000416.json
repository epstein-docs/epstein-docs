Even the room where the abuse occurred, your Honor, the massage room, was still set up in the same way it was 15 years ago, with a massage table and sex paraphernalia. And with respect to the photographs -- THE COURT: When you say the evidence was consistent with victim accounts, is it limited to the massage table and massage room or is there something else? MR. ROSSMILLER: Descriptions of the massage room and the massage table, that's correct, your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. All right. MR. ROSSMILLER: With respect to the photographs, your Honor, some of those were found in a locked safe which also held electronic disks with labels that included the words \"Young Miscellaneous Nudes 1\" and \"Girl Pics Nude.\" Your Honor, this is not an individual who has left his past behind. He is a continuing danger to the community and an extraordinary risk of flight and, for those reasons, the government joins the pretrial recommendation that the defendant be detained pending trial. THE COURT: All right. Thank you. Mr. Weingarten. MR. WEINGARTEN: Thank you, your Honor. I will use the podium, if that's okay. THE COURT: That's fine. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
