In 2011 and 2012, Mr. Perry was part of a select team appointed by the U.K. government\nto conduct a review of the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements, a review that formed the\nbasis of changes to the 2003 Extradition Act. (Id. Annex B ¶ 3.1).\nIn Mr. Perry's opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.\n¶ 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell's extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell's waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (Id. ¶¶ 24-39).\nMr. Perry's report also undercuts the government's representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from [a] US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. ¶ 23).\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julié (“Julié Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julié is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts. (Julié Rep.) (attached as\nExhibit V). Mr. Julié explains that, contrary to the government's representation, “the extradition\nof a French national to the USA is legally permissible under French law.” (Id. at 1).\n28\nDOJ-OGR-00002006",
