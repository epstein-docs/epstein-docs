Balde, a case currently pending in this District before Judge Failla, the defendant recently submitted, in connection with a similar challenge to the use of a White Plains grand jury in a Manhattan case, an analysis from jury composition expert Jeffrey Martin, who analyzed the racial and ethnic composition of the master and qualified jury wheels for Manhattan and White Plains. See Declaration of Jeffrey Martin in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v. Balde, No. 1:20-cr-00281-KPF, Dkt. No. 61-1 (filed Nov. 9, 2020), Exhibit A (“Martin Decl.”).
