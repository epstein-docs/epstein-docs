  "full_text": "can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-contraband items to cover her eyes.\n\nTo the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override BOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported. Certainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers. Defense counsel's May 7, 2021 letter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pre-trial detainees can be reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.\n\nThe Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for the MDC.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDated: May 14, 2021\nNew York, New York\n\nALISON J. NATHAN\nUnited States District Judge",
