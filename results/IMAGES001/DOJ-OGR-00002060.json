Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, NY 10007 Ghislaine Maxwell Your Honor, Ghislaine has been a friend of mine for over 25 years. [REDACTED] Ghislaine, without judgment or prejudice, offered me a roof over my head [REDACTED] free of charge or bill payments until I could get back on my feet so to speak. I had nothing to give her and she had nothing to gain from me living there. Given those circumstances I think it says a great deal about Ghislaine's moral character: in particular her loyalty and kindness towards someone who could offer her nothing in return. When another friend subsequently offered to pay rent for me this was still at a substantially lower than market rate. I want to conclude by saying that never in my wildest dreams do I think Ghislaine could be guilty of the terrible charges against. Like anyone charged with any crime, she is innocent unless proven guilty and has a right to due process and humane treatment and should be treated accordingly. Yours respectfully, [REDACTED] DOJ-OGR-00002060",
