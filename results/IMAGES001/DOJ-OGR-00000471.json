Richard M. Berman USDJ-SDNY Daniel P. Moynihan US Courthouse 500 Pearl St. Courtroom 17B New York, NY 10007-1312\nRe: US v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 CR 490 (SDNY) (RMB)\nDear Judge Berman:\nJeffrey Epstein replies to yesterday's government letter.\nEpstein was given the passport at issue by a friend. Some Jewish-Americans were informally advised at the time to carry identification bearing a non-Jewish name when traveling internationally in case of hijacking. He never used the document to travel internationally and never presented it to any immigration or customs authority. The passport stamps, predating his receipt of the document, do not reflect Mr. Epstein's entries or exits. His expired US passports, seized by the government and in its possession, would verify his true travel. The defense has asked the government to bring the original document to court for examination and inspection.\nAs Mr. Epstein truthfully reported in his Pretrial Services interview, he is a life-long American citizen. He has no other citizenship or legal permanent residency.\nRespectfully,\nMarc Fernich Martin Weinberg Reid Weingarten\ncc: All counsel\nDOJ-OGR-00000471",
