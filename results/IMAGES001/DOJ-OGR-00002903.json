The MDC has placed HEPA air filters in its attorney visiting rooms to improve air quality during visits. Additionally, the defendant has received the COVID-19 vaccine and is now fully vaccinated. The Government understands that defense counsel have thus far declined to meet with the defendant in person and instead rely on VTC calls, email, and supplemental phone calls to communicate with their client. The option of in-person visits remains available seven days per week should defense counsel wish to meet with the defendant in person.\nThe defendant's legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at the MDC. All inmate mail is sent to the MDC's mail room, where every piece of mail is processed before being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the volume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above, however, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has regular communication with counsel via VTC, which can be supplemented by phone calls.\nLike any other inmate, the defendant is patted down by MDC staff whenever she is moved to a different part of the facility. Typically, these searches include at least two pat-down searches of the defendant per day: once when she is moved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day room to her isolation cell each night. In addition, when the defendant elects to attend outdoor recreation, she is searched two additional times: once when she is moved to the recreation area, and once when she returns to the day room from the recreation area. MDC staff also conduct a body scan, which is a non-invasive machine scan, on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband. Because those scans take place in a different part of the facility than the day room, the defendant is patted down two additional times when these weekly scans occur: once when she is moved to the scan area, and once when\nDOJ-OGR-00002903",
