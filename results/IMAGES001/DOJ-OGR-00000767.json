Transparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full scope of Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to others. While it was not the victims' decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone (as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the \"more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence\" in the Government's possession that should be disclosed as well), the instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the conscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the failures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein's and Maxwell's abuse, provide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to how these crimes were investigated and prosecuted.
