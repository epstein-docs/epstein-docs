If the legal conditions of extradition are satisfied, the Investigating Chamber must issue a positive opinion to extradition, which is not subject to appeal. Following the Investigating Chamber's ruling, there is no specified time frame within which the government must issue an extradition decree. However, if the requesting State emphasizes the urgent nature of the request, the extradition decree is generally issued in only a few weeks. Therefore, the overall procedure is likely to be disposed of expediently under these circumstances.\n1 The 14 days period is divided as follows: the requested person must appear before the Public Prosecutor within 2 days of arrest, he or she must be heard by the Investigating Chamber no later than 5 working days after appearing before the Public Prosecutor, and the Investigating Chamber must then deliver its final opinion on the legality of the extradition request within 7 days. This procedure will be explained in more details in Part I of this opinion.\n51, rue Ampère - 75017 paris - tél. 01 88 33 51 80 - fax. 01 88 33 51 81 www.wjavocats.com - palais C1652 wj@wjavocats.com - 3 DOJ-OGR-00002128",
