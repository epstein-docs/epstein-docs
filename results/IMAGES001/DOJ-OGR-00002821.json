Judge Crotty therefore found that the defendant had not demonstrated substantial underrepresentation under the second prong of the standard set forth in Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357, 364 (1974). (Schulte Op. 13-15). Judge Crotty further found that the defendant's claim failed on Duren's third prong, as well, because the defendant had not established that any underrepresentation was the product of systematic exclusion in the jury selection process.
