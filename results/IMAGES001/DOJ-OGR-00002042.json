Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\nYour Honor,\nThis letter is provided by way of support for the release on bail of Ghislaine Maxwell,\nGhislaine and I have always remained in close touch. During the last 30 years or so this has been primarily by phone and email as Ghislaine has lived for the greater part of that time in the US whilst I live in London. On my last two trips to the US in February 2013 and in December 2018 I stayed with her for about a week on both occasions and she always made a point of seeing me whenever she came through London.\nconsider I have some knowledge I would certainly think of myself as a trusted advisor of hers.\nGhislaine eventually excelled academically and ended up graduating with honours from Oxford University and has gone on to achieve many and varied professional goals. Determination is a notable characteristic of hers, as is her naturalness and honesty – which I have never doubted – whether in her dealings with me personally or to my knowledge with and friends, or in her business interests or charitable activities. Until the laying of these charges against her, I am not aware there have ever been any allegations of criminal conduct against Ghislaine whether in the US or in any other country for that matter.\nGhislaine has always been an exemplary surrogate mother and friend. My son travelled with me on both my trips to the US mentioned above when he was aged staying with Ghislaine at her then homes in New York and Together with me, my son stands four-square behind her as she seeks to defend and clear her name. She has spent many hours with my son and he and I have never witnessed any inappropriate behaviour on her part.\n1 | P a g e\nDOJ-OGR-00002042",
