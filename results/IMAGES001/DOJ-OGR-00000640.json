We have a podium here for both attorneys and others who may be speaking, and so we would like you, attorneys and others who are speaking, to come up to the podium. This room is a little cavernous. We thought the podium over there would be more comfortable. For starters, and for this you don't have to go up to the podium, if you could just indicate your names. This table in front to my left, your right, are defense counsel, and that table to my right, your left, are government attorneys. If we could just ask the attorneys to introduce themselves. MS. COMEY: Good morning, your Honor. Maureen Comey and Alison Moe for the government. Joining us at counsel table are Special Agent Amanda Young of the FBI and Detective Paul Byrne of the NYPD. MR. WEINGARTEN: Good morning, your Honor. Reid Weingarten. MR. WEINBERG: Martin Weinberg. Good morning, your Honor. THE COURT: Good morning. MR. MILLER: Good morning, your Honor.
