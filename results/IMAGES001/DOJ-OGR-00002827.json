Fifth Amendment\n\nThe Equal Protection clause of the Fifth Amendment similarly forbids the exclusion of racial minorities from grand and petit juries.3 Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 492 (1977).\n\nTo raise a plausible equal protection challenge against a jury selection system, the defendant must show (1) a cognizable group; (2) that is substantially underrepresented; and (3) that the selection procedure is not racially neutral. Alston, 791 F.2d at 257. Although this three-part test resembles the Sixth Amendment framework, there is a critical difference: in contradistinction to a fair cross-section challenge brought under the Sixth Amendment, an equal protection claim must allege intentional discrimination by the jury selection system at issue. See id. (\"The equal protection clause . . . condemns underrepresentation of minorities only if it is the product of intentional discrimination.\"); see also United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 659 (2d Cir. 1996).\n\nIII. The JSSA\n\nFinally, the JSSA sets forth the Nation's policy that: \"all litigants in Federal court entitled to trial by jury shall have the right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes.\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 1861. The Second Circuit has held that fair cross-section challenges brought under the JSSA must also be analyzed using the Sixth Amendment's Duren test. See United States v. LaChance, 788 F.2d 856, 864 (2d Cir. 1986). Thus, if a fair cross-section challenge fails under the Sixth Amendment, it also fails under the JSSA. See id.
