Clerk's Office on Friday evening, July 18, 2025. See ECF No. 61 (Gov't Motion). The Gov't Motion requests that the Court \"unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information.\" Id. at 1-2.\nThe Court intends to resolve this motion expeditiously. However, the Court cannot rule on the motion without additional submissions from the Government. Specifically:\nMemorandum of law: Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) codified the practice, \"'older than our Nation itself,' that proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret.\" In re Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 491 (2d Cir. 1973) (Friendly, C.J.)); see also Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211, 218 (1979). Rule 6(e)(3) lists exceptions to the rule of secrecy but these are not invoked by the Government's Motion. The Second Circuit - but not many other circuits - has recognized that there are certain \"special circumstances\" in which release of grand jury records may be appropriate, based upon a court's supervisory authority over grand juries it empanels.1 See\n1 The Seventh Circuit agrees that a district court may order the release of grand jury materials upon a showing of special circumstances.
