Are there any consequences or relationship between what was uncovered and what he is obliged to do?\nMR. ROSSMILLER: May I have one moment, your Honor?\nTHE COURT: Yes.\nMR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, in response to that question, at the outset I should say that we don't have particular interaction with state authorities with respect to those types of notifications. We are, I would say, in the early stages of reviewing those materials. With respect to the defendant's obligations or potential consequences in the New York State system, we certainly will notify whichever authorities are appropriate. I don't think that we have a role other than that.\nI will say that they are extremely concerning with respect to bail here, with respect to the conduct here, and I expect we will get into that more in our submissions and bail argument.\nTHE COURT: By the way, if defense counsel wants to jump in at any point, feel free to do that?\nMR. WEINGARTEN: On that, we have not seen the pictures.\nTHE COURT: I haven't either.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00000390",
