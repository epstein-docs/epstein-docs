Accordingly, there is no need for an order to address this issue. MDC legal counsel also noted that the table in the attorney visiting room is equipped with a Plexiglas barrier down the middle to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Attorneys and clients are required to sit on opposite sides of that barrier for their health and safety, but they can position any laptop they may be reviewing in such a way that both the client and attorneys can view it while remaining on opposite sides of the table.

In response, the Government has sent the defendant replacement productions with reformatted versions of each identified document after consulting with MDC staff to ensure that the files would be viewable on the MDC computer system.
