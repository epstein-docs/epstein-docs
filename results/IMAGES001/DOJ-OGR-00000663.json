COMEY: I would also note that the question of\n9 Mr. Epstein's death is the subject of an ongoing and active\n10 investigation, as has been publicly noted, by a separate team\n11 of Assistant United States Attorneys from the Southern District\n12 of New York, separate from the team who is handling this\n13 prosecution, as well as a separate team of FBI agents.\n14 There is an ongoing and active grand jury\n15 investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Epstein's\n16 death. It is the function of a grand jury and of the Federal\n17 Bureau of Investigation to investigate crimes in the federal\n18 court system.
