Ghislaine Maxwell and her spouse's net worth at 31 October 2020 is approximately US$22,500,000. This is an estimate based on the 2019 tax filings to the end of December 2019 and review of bank statements and explanations provided by her spouse where bank statements are currently unavailable. This figure includes approximately $7.67m of advance legal retainer fees.\n\n16. There has been no alienation of any assets in the period 2015-2020 other than expenditure in the ordinary course of family life and more recently since 2019 very substantial expenditure on professionals engaged in the defense of Ghislaine Maxwell from the criminal charges she faces.\n\n17. In light of our inability to access all of the bank statements for the entire period for the reasons already explained in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, we have not been able to review every movement of cash from every account; we can, however, deduce from starting or opening balances and the closing balances that we have reviewed in each year that no significant sum of cash has been transferred outside of the control of Ghislaine Maxwell and or her spouse. All of the principal sources and uses of cash from 2015 through 2020 are covered by this report of financial condition without exception.\n\nSummary of Specific Transfers and Accounts\n\n18. We noted that accounts controlled either by Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse, either directly or indirectly, maintained substantial cash and equity balances of approximately $16 million during the period under review. The cash and equity balances clearly increased from the time of the disposal of the New York property. There are many examples of transfers between accounts, movements triggered by the closure of one banking relationship and the opening of new relationship (examples include the movement of cash and assets from ) as well movements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial investments.\n\n19. In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than $20 million in the earlier period of 2007-2011 which the Government described as transfers from Jeffrey Epstein's accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell's accounts and vice versa. We noted in our review of the financial disclosure materials, that during the period 2007-2011 Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities related to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted substantial transfers involving these corporate entities. We did not note any transfers of this nature or the nature described by the government in the 2015-2020 period which forms the subject of our Financial Condition Report.\n\n5 Macalvins prepared a report of financial condition for Ghislaine Maxwell dated April 30th 2017 (see appendices to this report). The report recorded assets legally and beneficially owned by Ghislaine Maxwell on the balance sheet date. The specific liability recorded arose from a personal guarantee given by Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter was resolved by the year end of 2017 without diminution of assets.\n\n5 | Page\nDOJ-OGR-00002066",
