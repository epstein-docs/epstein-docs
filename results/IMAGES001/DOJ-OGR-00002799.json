NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground that it reveals defense strategy. See e.g., United States v. Skelos, No. 15-CR-317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2021); United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2017); United States v.

Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).\nRule 17(c)(3) provides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court order,\" but \"[b]efore entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be disclosed\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00002799",
