  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-3 Filed 12/14/20 Page 5 of 5 has called the United States her home for almost 30 years. She has deep affective family ties here in this country Most of all, her own husband are here. During the past 18 months in particular Ghislaine has gone out of her way to continue to stay in the United States expressly so that she could put her case forward in a court of law should it ever come to that. I therefore feel great consternation and deep shock and sadness when I hear about the conditions of her present incarceration, which include over 150 days of solitary confinement and other extreme deprivations and restrictions. The great toll that this physical, mental, and emotional stress is taking on makes it even more impossible for her to adequately prepare her defence from inside jail. If she is granted bail, I will be in continuous touch with her during the weeks and months leading up to her trial, providing whatever support I can while she has the chance to fairly prepare for her upcoming trial and fight for her innocence. I am grateful for the opportunity to provide this statement. Sincerely, 4 | Page DOJ-OGR-00002031",
