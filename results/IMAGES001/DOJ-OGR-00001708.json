Nathan\nAugust 10, 2020\nPage 4\n\nSee Warme, 2009 WL 427111, at *2 (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime victim where \"the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the identity to the defendant would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the likelihood that victim will refuse to appear or testify\").\n\nWith each day that passes without knowing the identities of Victims 1-3, the defense is losing crucial time to conduct a meaningful investigation and prepare its defense so that Ms. Maxwell can receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. For these reasons, we respectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims 1-3 to defense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order.\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell's Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nWe also seek the Court's assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\"), and her access to the discovery in this case, so that she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed below, Ms. Maxwell has been treated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in her defense.\n\nIt has become apparent that the BOP's treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the circumstances surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (\"MCC\") on sex trafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC's Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\") due to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On August 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein's body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government indicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein's death.\n\nAs a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than other similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a defense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a month ago, on July 6, 2020, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms. Maxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-day period (40 days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three weeks longer than the 14-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under current COVID-19 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom do not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms. Maxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense counsel. Until recently, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to suicide watch protocols, including being woken up every few hours during the night and being forced to wear special clothing, despite the",
