These provisions shall also apply to matters which would not have been regulated by international conventions. The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international agreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: \"Treaties or agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an authority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by the other party\"). It follows from these provisions that the key question is whether France may extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France extradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of 11 March 2004, published by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying how the then recently amended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the following: \"Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n1 The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-1 to Article 696-47-1 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, and thus includes Article 696-2.\n51, RUE AMPÈRE - 75017 PARIS - TÉL. 01 88 33 51 80 - FAX. 01 88 33 51 81\nwj@wjavocats.com - www.wjavocats.com - PALAIS C1652\nDOJ-OGR-00002223",
