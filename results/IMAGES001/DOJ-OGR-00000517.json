So one question I have for each side is what about New Mexico. That's half of the question.\n\nThe rest of the question is as follows: Mr. Epstein has applied in New York state to lower his sex offender status from what's called a level 3, which is the highest level which I think carries with it a high risk of recidivism, according to these levels and to sex offender regulation.\n\nAnd he sought to have that lowered to level 1. His application was denied, as I understand the proceedings, by the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders New York state and then in state court by the courts and, particularly, a decision of the Honorable Justice Ruth Pickholz on our about January 18, 2011. I believe that decision was appealed to the New York State Appellate Division and was unanimously upheld.\n\nI read this morning a copy of the transcript of the proceedings before Judge Pickholz which I'm likely to place on the docket after today's session. And the question is for each side. First of all, they're free to comment on my description of the proceeding before Judge Pickholz.\n\nBut the question is whether there were or are other\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00000517",
