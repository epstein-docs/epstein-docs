  "full_text": "hopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.\n\nThis is no way to prepare for a trial. The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr. Robertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-consuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and making the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference between a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. Robertson's attorneys also need unobstructed access to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial. They need to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if necessary. They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to COVID-19. As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of severe outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdowns to ensure the safety of the staff and inmates. The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States Marshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well. None of this will provide Mr. Robertson the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally entitled. Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man, until it is safe and practically possible for his attorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is no longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson's release is necessary for the preparation of his defense. ยง 3142(i).\n\nIV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a Stay.\n\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded by the government's request for reconsideration or a stay pending appeal. See Doc. 298. In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr. Robertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of information following the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release",
