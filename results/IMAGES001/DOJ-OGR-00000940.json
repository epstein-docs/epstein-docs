In any other case, she would have been released long ago. But because of the \"Epstein effect,\" she is being detained and in truly unacceptable conditions. All we are asking for is a chance to defend the case. We respectfully request that Ms. Maxwell be released on reasonable conditions of bail or that the case be remanded for an evidentiary hearing.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMARKUS/MOSS PLLC\n40 N.W.
