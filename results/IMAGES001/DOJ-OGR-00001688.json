But that is unlikely.

Preventing the Improper Use of Discovery Materials by Potential Government Witnesses and Their Counsel\n\nThe defendant's proposed protective order subjects potential government witnesses and their counsel to the same restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely, if these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation in this case, they may not use those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case and may not post those materials on the Internet. (See Dkt. 29 at 2; Ex. A ¶¶ 3, 5).\n\nThe government construes the defense's proposal as one that \"impose[s] restrictions upon the Government\" itself. (Gov't Resp. at 5 (emphasis added)). It then provides a list of other statutes and regulations that might impose restrictions on the government that may be in conflict with the protective order, arguing that this possibility for conflict warrants rejection of the defense's proposed language.4\n\n3 It is not, as the government gratuitously asserts, so that the defense can engage in witness intimidation. (Gov't Resp. at 3 n.2).\n4 The government does not explain why, in the event of such conflict, it could not apply to the Court for resolution of potentially competing obligations.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00001688",
