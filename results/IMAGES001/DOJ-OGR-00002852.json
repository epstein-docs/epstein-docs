MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-4 on multiple occasions at Epstein's Palm Beach Residence, knowing that Minor Victim-4 was under the age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took place between approximately 2001 and 2004, MAXWELL groomed Minor Victim-4 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple means. For example, MAXWELL asked Minor Victim-4 about her family and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL also sought to normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other things, discussing sexual topics in front of Minor Victim-4 and being present when Minor Victim-4 was nude in the massage room of the Palm Beach Residence.
