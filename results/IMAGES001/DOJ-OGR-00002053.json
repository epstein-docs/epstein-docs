Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\n\nYour Honor:\n\nThis statement is in support of Ghislaine Maxwell's request for bail and her character.\n\nMy name is [REDACTED]. I have maintained a fairly close relationship with the entire family for most of my life. I not only got to know the senior Maxwells but also got to know very well their children including Ghislaine, since my age of 15.\n\nThough I was spending more of my time with the older siblings [REDACTED] I also chose deliberately to spend time with Ian, Kevin and Ghislaine, who were soon going to prep school together during term-time. You need to know that their father was narcissistic, highly controlling and demanding as a father, and let them know early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity. So all the kids knew they had to \"make it on their own\" despite the wealth and privilege in which they were growing up.\n\nAs I got to know each of these kids, including Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one worked very hard at their jobs, as neither parent, Bob nor Betty, would easily bear any idleness, and each strove for their father's and mother's respect through that their intelligence and that hard work. So it didn't surprise me that in her prep school classes, as well as her bachelor's and master's work at Oxford, where she'd followed her elder siblings, Ghislaine produced exemplary grades and a reputation as a serious student. I also noticed that personally, Ghislaine was quick-witted, full of initiative and good humor, sincerely caring towards everyone she knew.\n\nI've maintained a fairly close relationship with the entire Maxwell clan for most of my life. I didn't continue to visit them regularly in England, but I stayed in touch by phone, especially with Philip, Isabel, Betty and Christine from 1962 through the present. I spent time with Betty, Mrs Maxwell, as she needed support, having suddenly been left after the death of Robert Maxwell. Later on, I wrote a book explaining my gratitude to Betty for all she'd taught me about goodness and maturity. When she was finally on her deathbed with Parkinson's in 2013, I was glad Isabel, who was caring for her, read her my book.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00002053",
