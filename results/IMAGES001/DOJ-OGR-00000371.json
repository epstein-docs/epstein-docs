I have\n10 to tell you, I am shocked.\n11 MS. GAFFNEY: Right, but I spoke to the prosecutor\n12 that took over the case and they don't have anything, any\n13 affidavits, any statements, any notes.\n14 THE COURT: Why don't you speak to the prosecutor\n15 that did do the case, I am sure you could find that\n16 prosecutor.\n17 MS. GAFFNEY: I can find her, but based upon what\n18 the other prosecutor said, they did not speak to that\n19 prosecutor either.\n20 THE COURT: You did not speak to the prosecutor\n21 yourself, you did not speak to them, that is hearsay.
