  "full_text": "Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 69 Filed 08/04/25 Page 2 of 2\nAugust 4, 2025 Page 2\nDear Judge Berman, in making your decision to allow the Unites States of America's current sitting attorneys for the DOJ's request to release these files, I ask you to have our attorneys review the \"suggested\" redactions as they are the ones who also know the victims, their names, their truths and their stories unlike the Unites States Government who did not and does not even care to know our truth. They would rather ask a convicted imprisoned sex trafficker/abuser for information.\nIn conclusion, I beg the court to make sure it is the upmost priority that in any sort of release ALL and EVERY detail that could possibly reveal our identities be redacted. I also request that you take your time in making your decision and consider allowing for the victims attorney's to review these files before a release is permitted.\nSide Note: If other victims do not mind having their personal information redacted, my voice is not for them.\nSincerely and thank you for your time,\nXxx-victim/survivor\nDOJ-OGR-00000760",
