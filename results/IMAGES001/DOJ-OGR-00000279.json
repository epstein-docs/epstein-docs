The government's argument that Mr. Epstein's release would risk obstructive behavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr. Epstein's prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Attorney while they searched for a federal offense, at the government's behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-take of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential proffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to charge such an offense.

In short, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not believe there was factual support for the allegations. They do not provide a sufficiently reliable factual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence. As to the suggestion by the prosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an investigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knowledge as to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not attributable to or authorized by Mr. Epstein.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-00000279",
