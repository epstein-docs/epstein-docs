For instance, Article 3(1) the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France of April 23, 1996 provides that \"[t]here is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United States shall have the power to surrender a national of the United States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed.\" See Reply, Ex. A ¶ 9 (emphasis added)).
