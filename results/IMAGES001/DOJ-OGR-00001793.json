  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 63 Filed 10/07/20 Page 7 of 8\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 7, 2020\nPage 7\n\nAlthough the Government does not believe it has any obligation to gather or review emails sent or received by attorneys at the USAO-SDFL as part of their separate, prior investigation, the Government nonetheless intends to gather and review the emails sent to or from Attorney-1 to the extent those emails were preserved and gathered by OPR. As noted, Attorney-1 was the primary line assistant on that investigation, and Attorney-1's emails are thus the most likely to contain communications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained Attorney-1's emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails into an electronic review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms relevant to this case, including the defendant's name and the names of victims and witnesses. Based on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a substantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this prosecution. But to the extent searches of Attorney-1's emails reveal non-duplicative Giglio or 3500 material for any such victims or witnesses, the Government will produce any such identified material consistent with any schedule for pre-trial disclosures set by the Court. The Government does not intend to request or review emails for any other USAO-SDFL or Department of Justice attorney or otherwise perform a comprehensive review of the internal e-mails of that prosecutor's office from its wholly separate investigation, including by asking for any other material gathered by OPR as part of its investigation.\n\nSixth, beginning in or about 2019, attorneys with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia (\"USAO-SDGA\") were designated to participate in the representation of the United States in civil litigation brought by Epstein victims for violations of the Crime Victim Rights Act (\"CVRA\") by the USAO-SDFL in connection with the Florida Investigation after the USAO-SDFL was recused from that civil litigation. The Government intends to contact the USAO-SDGA and ask whether it (a) had any substantive communications with witnesses relevant to this prosecution during its participation in the CVRA civil litigation, or (b) gathered any information regarding the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell. If so, the Government will request any and all records regarding those topics and will review those records for materials that warrant disclosure in this case. Otherwise, the Government does not intend to request or review any materials from the USAO-SDGA.\n\n* * *\n\nAs noted above, none of these other offices or agencies has played any role in the investigation or prosecution of this case. In particular, none of these offices and agencies has participated in witness interviews or taken any other investigative steps with the Prosecution Team. Nor did any representative of these other offices or agencies play any role in developing strategy, making charging decisions, or presenting this case to the grand jury. Accordingly, although the Government maintains that none of these agencies is part of the Prosecution Team in this case, given the similarity of the nature of the conduct investigated in this case and the conduct investigated by those other offices and agencies, the Government is prepared to undertake the extensive efforts described above to obtain and review additional material. The Government will continue to produce any portion of those materials that warrants disclosure in this case, including in connection with its production of Giglio and 3500 material.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00001793",
