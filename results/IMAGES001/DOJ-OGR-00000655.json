  "full_text": "Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 53 Filed 09/03/19 Page 17 of 86 17 J8RsEPS1 Judge, is there are incredibly important questions that remain open. The public interest in this matter is obvious from this courtroom. There are conspiracy theories galore. We are all for finding the truth. We believe this court has an indispensable role to play. Whether or not this indictment is dismissed, I think this court has the inherent authority to find out what happened on its watch. Obviously, when the court detained Jeffrey Epstein, the court did not anticipate that weeks later he would be dead in his cell. I think given the inherent authority of the court, the court should make inquiry. This could come in many forms. Obviously the court made inquiry as to what happened in the first incident. When there was an allegation of an attempted suicide, the court made inquiry. The court obviously was interested. I recall your language. You talked about that being one of the several open questions indicating an interest on the court for the others as well. Obviously, the ultimate question is what happened to the client. THE COURT: You're talking about the July 23, 2019 incident? MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. The court obviously could hold hearings. The court could assign a lawyer to help the court. I think this is an area where there is intense public interest. We have complete SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00000655",
