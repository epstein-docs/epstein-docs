This is the largest room available and, with appropriate social distancing, it can safely accommodate 60 people. The court has further provided a live video feed to the press room at the courthouse where additional members of the credentialed in-house press corps can watch and hear the proceeding. Additionally, the court has provided a live audio feed for members of the public. My prior order indicated that the line can accommodate 500 callers, but with thanks of the court staff, that capacity has been increased to 1,000 callers. Lastly, the court has provided through counsel a separate call-in line to ensure audio access to nonspeaking co-counsel, any alleged victims identified by the government, including those who wish to be heard on the question of pretrial detention, and any family members of the defendant. That line is operational now as well. Counsel, beginning with Mr. Cohen, any objection to these arrangements regarding public access? MR. COHEN: No, your Honor. THE COURT: Ms. Moe? MS. MOE: No, your Honor. THE COURT: Then I will make the following findings: First, COVID-19 constitutes a substantial, if not overriding, reason that supports the court's approach to access SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
