Nathan United States District Judge United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, NY 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan, I am writing this letter on behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell, a woman who I grew up knowing and looking up to. we continue to be in touch today. I do not write this to discuss the charges against Ghislaine Maxwell, to plead that she is innocent or argue that she is guilty. I am simply hoping to offer a more well-rounded picture of Ms. Maxwell as a person outside of the opinions of the media. As a kid, I saw Ghislaine as an example of a strong, caring woman. In addition, her passion for saving the oceans was inspiring. At a very impressionable age, Ghislaine taught me a lot about generosity, determination, and resilience. Thank you for the opportunity to write this letter. I hope you will consider granting bail to Ghislaine Maxwell. Given the seriousness of the situation, I would not have considered taking action if I did not feel it necessary. Whatever the outcome, I felt it was important for me to share my unique perspective and stand up for what I believe in. Sincerely, DOJ-OGR-00002156",
