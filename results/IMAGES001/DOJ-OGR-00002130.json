At the bail hearing of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell on 14 July 2020, the US Government made the following point in support of its motion to detain the defendant:\n\"The government has spoken with the Department of Justice attachés in the United Kingdom and France. With respect to France, we have been informed that France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a matter of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States.\"2.\n2. The international ties of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell and her French nationality appear as one of the grounds for which bail was denied by the Court, which found that:\n\"Ms Maxwell's history and characteristics support the position of her posing a risk of flight. Ms Maxwell has substantial international ties and could facilitate living abroad if she were to flee the United States. She holds multiple foreign citizenships, has familial and personal connections abroad, and owns at least one foreign property of significant value. In particular, she is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens\".\n3. The present report intends to evaluate whether the contention that France is a nation that does not extradite its citizens is correct as a matter of law.\n4. It will first set out the various steps of the French extradition procedure (Part I), and then outline the grounds on which extradition requests are analyzed under French law, and especially the status of the rule against extradition of nationals, in order to assess the application of these principles to an extradition request made by the USA, in particular where, as in this case, the requested person has executed an irrevocable waiver of his/her right to contest extradition and is present in France only because she fled the United States in violation of her bail conditions.
