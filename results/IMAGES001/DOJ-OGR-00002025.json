  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-2 Filed 12/14/20 Page 4 of 5\nI can attest to calmness and courage and focus and consistency in immediately stating why each allegation that comes up, was/is not true and why. She was completely consistent no matter how many times it came up or what variations of it came up.\nI know that unlike the late Mr. Epstein and others, did not take the 5th in civil litigation. She underwent many hours of deposition because she has nothing to hide.\nThe thousands by now of stories and accusations against her reported in the press have morphed into a figurative tsunami of monikers - 'madam', 'procurer', 'witch', 'monster' and 'master architect' - public opprobrium and character assassination. Absolutely anyone who dares to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to question any of the accusers' allegations, let alone support Ghislaine personally, gets it shot off immediately amid of hail of social vilification and malignancy and reputational slaughtering.\nI can attest that when she moved, it was always and only due to fear of being discovered by the press or 'vigilantes' - the fear was palpable.\nThe only reason that she was forced to find quiet places to be in all this time, is due to the howling 'mobs' screaming for her 'scalp' on Twitter and other social media outlets. has been forced to 'hide' from the crazy people who seem to want to take matters into their own hands and grab her themselves or worse, aided and abetted by the media - The Sun for example in the UK has offered a Â£10,000 'bounty' on her head for anyone who can get them 'in front of her' - this on November 19, 2019 - was extremely shocking and scary - it felt like incitement to violence.\nI can attest to the fear that it engendered.\nWith this kind of 'vigilante' publicity, her life has absolutely been in danger and she has herself received death threats and also even her own attorneys too. This is not a joke. This is the sole reason why she has had to find private homes that are independent - Literally any person at all who has had even the most small of interactions has been vilified in the press - did not 'slither away' anywhere - she was finally able to locate a place where she could not be moving around constantly and collect herself to fight for her life and to clear her name. That is all she has been doing.\nI also want to address the widely published statements and media views that was 'a fugitive from justice and from the FBI', a 'proven criminal', and that she was reported as being in places as far flung as Brazil, London, Israel, France, in a submarine, on a yacht, being protected by the Mossad, Special Forces, etc. Nothing was further from the factual truth. never left nor intended to leave the United States. She wanted only to stay close to her family and fight her case and was in constant contact with her lawyers all the time. Up until the day of her arrest, she had never been in any criminal situation whatsoever and had neither been charged, arrested, or interviewed and therefore had no reason at all to be 'hiding from the police' - which she categorically was not.\nhas only and always maintained her absolute innocence of these accusations, and how she has felt 100% frustrated that she cannot come out and fight against each and all allegations in the civil suits that have come against her. I know deeply and expect that she will welcome a fair legal process to clear her name.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-00002025",
