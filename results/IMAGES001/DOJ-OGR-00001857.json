Pyramid Co. of Onandaga, 435 F.3d 110, 124 (2d Cir. 2006); see also Unites States v. Wey, 256 F. Supp. 3d 355, 411 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (Nathan, J.)

We are merely seeking the ability to file a renewed bail application for Ms. Maxwell without further risking the safety and privacy of sureties needed to support that application. This is the first of several confidentiality issues that will arise in connection with the Motion, and the sureties will be looking at the Court's ruling as an indication of the level of confidentiality they can expect to be afforded. These individuals have requested that their privacy and safety be appropriately protected by the Court.\nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully request that the Court file the proposed redacted version of the November 25th Letter, attached as Exhibit A, and the proposed redacted version of this letter, attached as Exhibit B. In the alternative, we request leave to withdraw both letters and refile the November 25th Letter with the redacted sentences deleted.\nDOJ-OGR-00001857",
