It is important to emphasize that the Sentencing Guidelines \"are guidelines—that is, they are truly advisory.\"54 A District Court is \"generally free to impose sentences outside the recommended range\" based on its own \"informed and individualized judgment.\"55\n\nWith respect to the four-level leadership enhancement, the District Court found that Maxwell \"supervised\" Sarah Kellen in part because of testimony from two of Epstein's pilots who testified that Kellen was Maxwell's assistant. The District Court found that testimony credible, in part because it was corroborated by other testimony that Maxwell was Epstein's \"number two and the lady of the house\" in Palm Beach,\n\n52 United States v.
