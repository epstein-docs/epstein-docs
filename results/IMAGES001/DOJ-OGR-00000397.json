WEINBERG: Not the legality of the NPA. I think the discussion here is going to be about its scope.\nTHE COURT: From the defense, yes. You don't think you expect to hear anything from the government, for example?\nMR. WEINBERG: In the Southern District case, the CVRA case, maybe two weeks ago the Northern District of Georgia prosecutors, who are proxy for the Southern District of Florida, filed the submission before District Judge Marrah in the CVRA case totally supporting the constitutionality and legality of the NPA, their discretion to enter into it, and that there absolutely has never been a charge that Mr. Epstein ever did anything other than fully perform his end as a citizen who is expecting the benefits of a contract that he lived up to.\nTHE COURT: I thought there had been some contention that the way that the victims vis-a-vis the Florida NPA were dealt with or not dealt with was one basis for attacking the legality of that arrangement.\nMR.
