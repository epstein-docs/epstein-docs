Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the vast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing alone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court's conclusion altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond; the amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and future income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her to compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she has procured “significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge” over a property and that $4 million is invested in an “illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable difficulty,” see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Court's ultimate conclusion that the financial package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight.\n\nThe proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant's third-party custodian under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)(B)(i); that the Defendant would be placed in home confinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of Pretrial Services; and that she would surrender all travel documents.
