THE COURT: Thank you very much. MS. McCAWLEY: The next client of ours that will be speaking this morning is Sarah Ransome. MS. RANSOME: Thank you, your Honor. My name is Sarah Ransome, R-a-n-s-o-m-e. I'm a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's international sex trafficking ring. I would like to thank the Court for the dignity and the respect you are showing me here today, as well as the other victims. I would also like to acknowledge and extend my gratitude to the prosecutors from the Southern District of New York for pursuing justice on behalf of the victims. Please, please finish what you have started. I struggled to find the words to adequately say how important your work is to us. For a very long time Jeffrey Epstein gamed the system at every level, and when he realized he couldn't do that any longer, he showed the world what a depraved and cowardly human being he is by taking his own life. But we, the victims, are still here, prepared to tell the truth, and we all know he did not act alone. We are survivors, and the pursuit of justice should not abate. Thank you, your Honor. THE COURT: You're very welcome. MS. McCAWLEY: Our next client who is going to be SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00000695",
