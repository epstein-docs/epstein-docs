The agreement involved a plea in state court to soliciting an underaged girl, which would require registration, compensation paid to alleged victims, and an NPA from the feds, in other words, a declination by the federal government, an agreement that was approved all the way up in main justice and it sure seemed like a global solution at the time to everyone involved, including my client. What happened since then? Mr. Epstein continued a life of success, generosity, creativity and, more important, a law-abiding life from 2008 forward. How do we know? Because when you are in registration the way he is, every single night his whereabouts are known. There is constant reporting, constant monitoring, and absolutely, to our knowledge, no complaints by anybody from that moment forward about his conduct until we have arrived in court here. Now, what has happened in court from that moment? There have been lawsuits, many of them ludicrous, dismissed out of hand. But when something like this happens, a lot of stuff comes out of the woodwork, and there were lawsuits that Mr. Epstein settled also in the normal course. There was one particular litigation that leads to this occasion, and that is, under the Crime Victims Rights Act, that act simply says that victims have a right to be consulted by SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
