No federal charges involving Petitioners have ever been brought against Epstein, and no such federal charges have been resolved. The Non-Prosecution Agreement about which Petitioners complain disposes of no federal criminal charges against Epstein, and that agreement does not bar the United States from bringing federal criminal charges against Epstein.
