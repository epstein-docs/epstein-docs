Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, NY 10007 November 23rd 2020 Your Honor This statement is in support of Ghislaine Maxwell's request for bail and her character. My name is [REDACTED]. I write this letter in support of [REDACTED] Ghislaine Maxwell. We remain close and have been in communication by phone and videolink most weeks up until her arrest on July 2nd 2020; I have historically regularly visited her in the United States at least a couple of times a year and she has always caught up with me when she has visited the UK or Europe. I have historically and continue to act as one her closest confidants and advisors, [REDACTED]. Ghislaine has always faced up to every challenge she has met in her life whether it involved either her business interests or philanthropic interests. I consider her to be absolutely straight, clear and honest in all her dealings with third parties - this attitude applies to her filing her tax returns as it does to every other aspect of her life: organised, clear and straight. Until these charges, [REDACTED] has never been involved in any allegation of breaking the law in any jurisdiction. Speaking for myself, [REDACTED] can confirm that I stand absolutely behind her in her fight to clear her name. [REDACTED] she has been a constant visitor to my family homes, has had my children to stay with her in her homes [REDACTED] and I would not hesitate to leave any of my kids or grandkids in her care. I have never witnessed, nor heard from my children or grandchildren any reports of any inappropriate behaviour [REDACTED]. Ghislaine has stayed at all times in the jurisdiction of the Unites States since the new charges against the late Jeffrey Epstein and has from the outset confirmed to me personally on DOJ-OGR-00002036",
