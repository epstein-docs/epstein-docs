The court concludes as follows: First, the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention. As noted, the crimes involving minor victims that Ms. Maxwell has been accused of are serious enough to trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention. And to reiterate, Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent until proven guilty, but if she were convicted of these crimes, the sentences she faces is substantial enough to incentivize her to flee. In total, Ms. Maxwell, who is 58 years old, faces up to a 35-year maximum term of imprisonment if convicted. And even if sentences are run concurrently, she would still face up to a decade of incarceration. Second, noting again that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to the full presumption of innocence, it is appropriate to consider the strength of the evidence proffered by the government in assessing risk of flight. The government's evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong. Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the indictment describes multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell's involvement in serious crimes. The government also proffers that this witness testimony will be corroborated by significant contemporaneous documentary evidence. While the defense states that it intends to assert SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00001959",
