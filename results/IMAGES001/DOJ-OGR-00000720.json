When I turned around, she was entering Jeffrey's residence. He no longer even tried to schedule his appointments with other girls in secrecy from me. Maybe he never did. I was too stupid to see.\n\nMy world shattered. I had been so naive. I had an epiphany in a calvary of desperation. I realized I was just one of many young girls he had in rotation come to perform for him for money. I went into a deep depression and never lifted completely. I wanted to inflict pain on myself. I was humiliated, angry, and suicidal. I locked myself away from everything. I cut myself off forever from the world I had known.\n\nI endured the daily agony of knowing my life would never be the same. I could never go back to New York City and the wonderful life I had taken for granted before I met this demon named Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThis creature had manipulated and outwitted the whole system, including some of the most intelligent scientists, political people, prosecutors, and power players. How easy was it to manipulate a 16-year-old virgin who never had a boyfriend and came from a background of hardship with no parental guidance or support.\n\nI went to therapy and was given antidepressants for severe anxiety and depression. My only solace, years later,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00000720",
