  "full_text": "The Court will now announce its findings with respect to the sealed documents that are the subject of this motion to unseal. These findings are a result of the Court's particularized review of each of the 156 documents it has considered for unsealing today. As before, the Court will proceed in the order of the documents listed on the chart that the parties have provided, listing their respective positions for each document. This chart is Exhibit F to Ms. Menninger's declaration, filed with Ms. Maxwell's reply brief in support of her objections to unsealing. The docket number is 1167-2. As before, the Court is grateful to the parties for their assistance in organizing the enormous number of documents for review. It has been a great service to the Court, and I do thank the parties for that. As I go through, references to page numbers are going to be those typed on the document, not those numbers assigned by the ECF system. Finally, as I go through, I will ask my law clerk, Patrick Malone, to interrupt if I am misreading any of this. As you can see, the parties' chart is enormous and has multiple, multiple iterations of findings listed on it. If I am misreading, I will ask Pat to interrupt so we don't have to go back at the end and confuse ourselves even more. Here we go. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
