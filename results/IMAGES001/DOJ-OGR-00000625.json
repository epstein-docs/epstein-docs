Mr. Epstein's death is a tragedy to everyone involved in his case. One open question, among others, is whether the investigations referenced in your letter will include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23, 2019. To my knowledge, it has never been definitively explained what the BOP concluded about that incident. Sincerely, Richard M. Berman cc: Chief Judge Colleen McMahon Edward Friedland, District Executive Adam Johnson, Supervisory Staff Attorney MCC Michael Greco, U.S. Marshal Alison Moe, Assistant United States Attorney Martin Weinberg, Counsel for Mr. Epstein DOJ-OGR-00000625",
