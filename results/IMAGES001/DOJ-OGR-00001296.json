Doc. 194. As bad as the pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a state of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more to the current April 5, 2021 trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last September, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his attorneys in person in conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court's concerns about the defense team's ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court's impression on that point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with attorneys and then bringing COVID-19 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted attorney-client meetings at the Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is now able to impose significantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La Pasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.

Although the government's concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately believes that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson's appearance and the safety of the community by releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully tailored conditions.
