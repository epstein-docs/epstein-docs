Obviously we assume there is a tape that leads directly to the door where Jeffrey Epstein was housed. If that tape reports for 12 hours before his death that no one went in and out of that room, then the suggestion that there was something other than a suicide seems preposterous. But there is no such evidence that has surfaced to date. Just the opposite. We have heard, and we actually read in the press, that the tapes were either corrupted or not functioning. Talk about a yikes. If, in fact, the system was broken for six months before Jeffrey Epstein was housed, I mean, that would be stunning incompetence. If it was allowed to continue to be inoperative when Jeffrey Epstein was housed, it would be incompetence times ten. But what if the tapes only broke down or were inoperative or were corrupted on the day he was killed or the day he died? Then we're in a completely different situation. So where does this lead?
