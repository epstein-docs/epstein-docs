She did not have to show me the kindness and dedication that she has showed me throughout my life, but she did. When my parents could not provide me with the emotional support I needed at various times, she was always there for me. I know for sure that what Ghislaine would most like is to have the time and the opportunity to prepare her defence properly against the serious charges she is facing. I do not have any assets of my own to put forward but I do know that Ghislaine is an honest, committed, loyal and compassionate person who needs her family's support as much as we have needed hers in the past, so it is an honour as much as a personal obligation for me to be able to provide this letter of support for her in her hour of need. Respectfully yours.",
