Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nConfidential Letter in Support of Ghislaine Maxwell\nYour Honor,\nI, [REDACTED] am petitioning the court to release on bail [REDACTED] Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell. It is my belief that she is of good character to warrant this release. I am also setting aside cash money in case it is needed as security for her bond. [REDACTED] We have always been close to Ghislaine's family.\nWe have all remained close. I would dine with Ghislaine a few times a year and she came over to my place of business for a lovely lunch the Summer before last.\nI live in [REDACTED] and have six-decade roots in that community. I am on staff at [REDACTED] and am a respected member [REDACTED].\nI have a reputation to hold fast. I treat this petition seriously. I don't have lots of cash, but I am putting up $ 2,000 as bond towards her bail because I believe in Ghislaine's innocence and I believe that the only way Ms. Maxwell will be able to defend herself against the charges is out on bail. Her conditions of confinement are extreme even for the BOP.\nAs to her \"fleeing\" she didn't before, she won't. I believe that. The Court should release her on bail.\nRespectfully,\n[REDACTED]\nDOJ-OGR-00002058",
