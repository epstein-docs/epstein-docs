In my eyes she is a totally trustworthy individual and I would have no hesitation at any time leaving children or young adults in her care. Regarding the extremely serious charges she is now facing, Ghislaine has repeatedly denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, any such improper and criminal conduct. Based on my knowing her very well and the nature of her character I believe in her innocence and I have no doubt that she will deal with all the allegations head on and will attend trial for the opportunity it provides her finally to put her side of the story without it being intermediated by an overwhelmingly hostile media. have no doubt will not shirk the responsibility she has to attend her trial in this matter and will fight the case through to the finish to clear her name. Knowing her as I do, for Ghislaine too there is simply no other option Respectfully, 2 | Page DOJ-OGR-00002043",
