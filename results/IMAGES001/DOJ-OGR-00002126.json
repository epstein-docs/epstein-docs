(See Exhibit A).\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe principle against the extradition of French nationals does not constitute a binding rule of international law and is not considered a constitutional principle under French law.\nThe extradition of French nationals can be prohibited under the terms of an international treaty. However, the existing Extradition Treaty between France and the USA of 23 April 1996 does not contain such prohibition. As a result, the extradition of a French national to the USA is legally permissible under French law.\nIn order to assure the US authorities that she will not attempt to contest her extradition as a French citizen or otherwise, we are informed that Ms Maxwell is about to execute an irrevocable waiver of her right to seek the protection of the French Courts to fight\n51, rue Ampère - 75017 paris - tél. 01 88 33 51 80 - fax. 01 88 33 51 81 www.wjavocats.com - palais C1652 wj@wjavocats.com - 1 DOJ-OGR-00002126",
