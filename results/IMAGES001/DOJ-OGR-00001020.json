Mr. Cohen, based on the\n9    government's description of both the quantity and quality of\n10   discovery, is that schedule that's been laid out sufficient\n11   from your perspective to do everything that you need to do?\n12   MR. COHEN: Your Honor, just two points in that\n13   regard. I think counsel for the government did not mention in\n14   the e-mail we had sent to your Honor's law clerk that August 21\n15   would be the deadline for production of search warrant\n16   applications and the subpoena returns. I think she just failed\n17   to mention it for the record. That would also be part of the\n18   schedule.\n19   THE COURT: Thank you.\n20   Ms. Moe, do you agree?\n21   MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. I apologize.\n22   We did include that in the e-mail to your Honor's chambers, and\n23   that is correct.\n24   And thank you, counsel, for clarifying that.\n25   MR. COHEN: Two additional points, your Honor. The\n26   trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00001020",
