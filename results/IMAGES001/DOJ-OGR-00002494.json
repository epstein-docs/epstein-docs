  "full_text": "MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, when will the Court be providing us with that line itemed deposition? The reason I ask is, we would just ask for a couple days after we receive that to analyze -- I think an appeal looks unlikely. But once we see the redactions, we would have to make that determination and confer with Ms. Maxwell, who is in custody, as you know. I would just ask for a little bit of leeway to be able to do those two things.\n\nTHE COURT: Yes, ma'am. I expect you will receive it in the next day or two. But if you don't and you need extra time, let me know.\n\nMS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor.\n\nThe last one, your Honor, is with regards, since we are all together, to the issue of the third round of unsealing. Because we already provided notice to Does 1 and 2, we are not providing notice to them, I understand.\n\nBut there is a little bit of a gray area within the protocol as to how to calculate days for objections because they normally flow from the date on which a nonparty receives notice.\n\nAnd so if I could ask for a date certain, preferably, given the other obligations, a week from this Friday, that would allow us enough time to get those objections done as well.\n\nTHE COURT: Ms. McCawley, is that OK with you?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
