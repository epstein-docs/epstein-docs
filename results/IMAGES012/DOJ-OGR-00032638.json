There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky enough to get one. I only have one roomate to deal with and the room is a decent size so I can have privacy too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement, however, I am sad also. I don't know what's going on,..... I miss Will,.... I'm not used to falling asleep by myself. I'm not used to him having pictures of naked women on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not, but atleast it feels like it right now. I don't know how I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely. Anyway, I finished orientation today. It was sooooo boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when registration opens and go on the computer and finish applying for classes because for some reason that shit will be open tomorrow. I don't know. My INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it this morning at 3am because I had to register today and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I'm so last minute on everything I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME WEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Hold On: Let me say that again) I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY WEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I also want to get a vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because apparently there are 'narcs' everywhere. Well, I'm really excited about starting class and meeting people. If you've read to this point then you feel bad for me. I'll stop torturing and finish this thing up,...... I hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry to those of you I promised to hang out with but couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch to all of those who know me. Wish me luck!\n4:45 PM - 0 Comments - 0 Kudos - Add Comment\nThursday, December 22, 2005\ngrown up\nCurrent mood: crappy\nI am leaving Will to go to in three days. I am moving to Tallahassee in twelve days. I'm so sad; I can't stand it. I guess you can say I'm sulking,.....but I can't help the way I feel. The whole thing is so bitter-sweet.
