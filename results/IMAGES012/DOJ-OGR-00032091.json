Journal Columns Dispatches Departments Progressive Guide Calendar Online Store\nColumns\nBob Fitrakis\nThe Wexner War\nAugust 1, 2003\nWe can only imagine Limited founder and apparel magnate Leslie Wexner's consternation over the leaking of a document entitled, Wexner Analysis: Israeli Communication Priorities 2003. The report was prepared for the Wexner Foundation and provides insight into Wexner's relationship with the state of Israel. As the Cleveland Plain Dealer noted, Wexner keeps his personal life \"under padlock.\" But what has surfaced over the years simply adds to his mystery. In the Shapiro murder file, personally ordered destroyed by Columbus Chief of Police James Jackson, Wexner is listed as an alleged organized crime associate. A December 1995 Architectural Digest article and a follow-up 1996 New York Times report detailed the inner sanctum of Wexner's former Manhattan townhouse, one of the largest in the city.\n\"Visitors described a bathroom reminiscent of James Bond movies: hidden beneath a stairway, lined with lead to provide shelter from attack and supplied with closed-circuit television screens and a telephone, both concealed in a cabinet beneath the sink,\" wrote the Times. The townhouse is now reportedly owned by Wexner's even more mysterious protégé, Jeffrey E. Epstein.\nEpstein, who recently loaned his jet to President Clinton, is usually seen in the company of Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of deceased publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell. After Maxwell fell or was pushed off his yacht in 1991, it was revealed that he was working for the Israeli government and the Mossad, the Israeli Intelligence service. While Maxwell's ties to the Mossad are well-documented, Epstein's connections are less well known. The London Sunday Times quoted a New York social observer describing Epstein as follows: \"He's Mr. Enigmatic. Nobody knows whether he's a concert pianist, property developer, a CIA agent, a math teacher or a member of Mossad.\" New York Magazine claims Epstein is the man who moves Wexner's billions around the globe.\nWexner's philanthropic side is more public. In 1998, the Wall Street Journal reported that Wexner was part of the \"Mega Group,' a loosely organized club of 20 of the nation's wealthiest and most influential Jewish businessmen.\" The Mega Group meets purportedly to discuss \"philanthropy,\" but others have speculated that their charitable interests are often a cover for lobbying activities on behalf of Israel. The Wall Street Journal identified Max Fisher, a Detroit financier and billionaire, as a member of the Mega Group. Fisher was used as a private Middle East diplomat by President Gerald Ford during the 1970s and is considered Wexner's mentor.\nSo, when the Wexner Analysis report was leaked, it caused a stir but no questioning of Wexner's little-explored relationships with Epstein and Fisher. Frank Lutz, the Republican Party pollster and spin doctor, prepared the Wexner Analysis. Lutz's report essentially outlines a political PR campaign \"as the post-war dust settles over the Iraqi desert.\"\nThe Wexner Analysis points out that \". . . many sympathize with the plight of the Palestinian people, [but] there is no love lost for Yassir Arafat.\" The report complains that, \"the emergence of Mahmoud Abbas as the new Palestinian Prime Minister comes exactly at the wrong time.\"\nWhy? \"His ascent to power seems legitimate. He is a fresh face, and a clean-shaven one at that. He speaks well and dresses in Western garb,\" the report states. Lutz's assessment is that \"the Palestinians throw us this curve ball.\"\nWed Dec 07 2005 March '03 The Talented Don't forget to cl articles from 20C\nBob Fitrakis\n\"Why Bush must and tried alongsi Hussein\" December 31, 20\n\"The year democ November 30, 20\n\"Demonstration September 4, 201\n\"Call it what it is propaganda\" August 1, 2003\n\"The Wexner Wa August 1, 2003\n\"Why four died ii Governor Rhodes relationship with April 21, 2003\n\"U.S. Easter cele the New Caesar\" April 21, 2003\n\"The rise of auth and the racist dr April 18, 2003\n\"Silence Remain: April 2, 2003\n\"Is the new COII underway in Col March 24, 2003\n\"Sick Caesar: Re from office\" March 15, 2003\n\"Why Moss bang and how the mai covered the stor March 7, 2003\nhttp://www.freepress.org/columns/display/3/2003/725 Page 1 of 2 Public Records Request No.: 17295 12/7/2005 DOJ-OGR-00032091",
