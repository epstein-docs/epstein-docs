  "full_text": "Professional Standards Unit\nPalm Beach Police Department\nJanuary _, 2007\nPage 6\n\n4. Broken \"Sex Toys\" in Epstein's Trash. The Police Report details the police \"discovery\" in Epstein's trash of what is described as pieces of \"sex toys\" and makes the point that these materials corroborate witness statements. Omitted from both the Police Report and the Probable Cause Affidavits is the fact that during the course of executing the search warrant on Epstein's home, the police realized that a key \"sex toy\" was in fact the entirely innocent broken handle of a salad server. Though the \"sex toys\" play a prominent role in the Police Report and Probable Cause Affidavits, the Police Report was never amended to reflect the discovery of this new and highly relevant evidence.\n\n5. Polygraph Examination and Report. The State Attorney was provided with a report of a polygraph examination of Epstein and the polygraph examiner was subsequently interviewed by the State Attorney. The polygraph exam focused on the allegations being made with respect to __________. The report confirmed that (a) no sexual conduct occurred; (b) Epstein never threatened __________ (c) __________ told Epstein she was 18 years old; and (d) Epstein believed __________ was 18 years old. Though these results were provided to the Police Department and Detective Recarey was given an opportunity to meet with the polygraph examiner, after confirming that he would attend he inexplicably failed to appear or to send a representative in his place. No information concerning the fact of the exam appeared in the Police Report or the Probable Cause Affidavits.\n\n6. Meetings with the State Attorney. Attorneys for Epstein provided other information to the State Attorney, as well. Though clearly material, virtually none of it was included in the Police Report. For example, at the meeting at which the polygraph expert was made available for questioning, the psychiatrist who conducted a psycho-sexual examine of Epstein (and who concluded he was healthy) was also made available to discuss his evaluation. Also provided at the meeting was information concerning __________ MySpace website profile, including her false representations that she was 18 and nude and otherwise provocative photos that she chose to use to represent herself to the public.
