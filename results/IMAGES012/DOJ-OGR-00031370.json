They said they suspected me of \"causing losses to their company.\" -Which by the way is bullshit! I was 'by the book' on EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN! I already have another job if I want it, and it's so much more money$$$$$$. I'm going to be making more money than my old bosses at VS. Success is definately the sweetest revenge.
