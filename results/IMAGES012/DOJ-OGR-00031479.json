At approximately 3:10pm, a man came to the front of the store and called out her name. The man never came in the store, but stood directly in front without ever crossing the carpeted area. They talked for a few minutes and he showed her a piece of paper that looked like a receipt. A few moments later she walked back and started saying that the man who had come in the store was the manager at Journeys, and that he had accused her of stealing the shoes she had returned; claiming that the shoes belonged to someone else. Soon after she came back on the sales floor and a woman in her mid to late 20's came in and requested to speak to who claims she stole her shoes was at the store and the lady was screaming at her.

She accused of stealing the shoes and returning them for something suitable for herself, with the original receipt.
