But after the sixth 7 time of asking the same question and then coming 8 back and pointing a finger at her and saying, 9 \"You're a liar\" -- 10 MR. TEIN: That didn't happen. 11 MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. But I'm not 12 going to allow her to answer that question, 13 because she's answered that same question and has 14 explained it. 15 Now Counsel might be sitting there rubbing 16 his head with a migraine. That's his problem. 17 But if he can't ask a question appropriately in a 18 professional manner, we will leave. I will not 19 allow her to be berated like that. 20 MR.
