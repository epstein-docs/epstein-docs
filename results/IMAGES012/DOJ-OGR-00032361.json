I explained to her that she was not in any trouble however as part of this investigation, I needed to ask certain questions. Sjoberg stated that there were times that Epstein would ask her to perform during the massage. He would instruct her to rub his nipples as he masturbated himself. Sjoberg stated she felt \"grossed\" about the behavior but as she was getting paid, she just continued. Sjoberg also advised she would on occasion perform the massages naked. Epstein would on occasion, utilize the vibrator/massager on her vagina area when she performed the massages. Sjoberg explained that Epstein never exposed himself to her as he maintained himself covered under the towel he would be wearing. When Epstein would masturbate he would be covered. I asked if Sjoberg ever received any gifts, or any gratuities from Epstein. Sjoberg advised aside from being paid well, she advised Epstein took care of her tuition from Palm Beach Atlantic College. She received a rental car for a week when her scooter broke down. Additionally she received other gifts from Epstein. Epstein also recommended her to another client who resides at Breakers Row in Palm Beach. The client she was referred to was \"Glenn\" unknown last name, and his wife, who she provided a massages to. The statement was concluded and placed into evidence upon our return to the Palm Beach Police Department. While at the police station, I researched Florida tag X88-EFF which was also previously seen on the property when there was physical surveillance being done at the property. The vehicle is registered to of Lake Worth, Florida. Researching Mr. and the vehicle revealed that his daughter, had been driving the vehicle and was cited for unlawful speed in Lake Clark Shores. The vehicle is a tan, Chevrolet Camaro, 2-door. I researched date of birth, 11-18-1987, resides at 3307 Blatusrol Lane in Lake Worth. has a my space page called www.myspace.com/pinkpetals. In her web page, shows various photos of photographed at a beach. An interview is forthcoming. A review of the video disks which was extracted at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Computer Crime Unit revealed that only one hidden camera was functional at the time. Several images of Epstein working at his office were seen. Additional footage of Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova was seen. There was other footage of females seen. The identity of the females is unknown at this time, until such time as I meet with certain females to show the video footage to confirm if, in fact, it is them on the video. At this time it appears that and Haley Robson are seen sitting with Epstein beside his desk in the evening hours. Due to poor lighting, a direct confirmation cannot be made at this time. Inv. Continues. **************************** N A R R A T I V E # 37 **************************** 07/26/17 Page 2048 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032361",
