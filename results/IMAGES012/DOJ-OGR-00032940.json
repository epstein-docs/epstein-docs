Ed -----Original Message----- From: William Mook [mailto:william.mook@mokindustries.com] Sent: Thursday, September 29, 2005 12:49 PM To: Razek, Ed Subject: [Fwd: [Fwd: Re: contract]] Ed, We're working with Merrill Lynch investment bank and Delta to raise $50 million by selling at a discount the first $600 million worth of jet fuel from our production schedule. The $600 million will have an opportunity to be re-invested for equity in the fuel facility to create an opportunity for additional earnings at the investor's option. Assuming we get a 3:1 multiplier in this second round, the $50 million could conceivably net the investors $1.8 billion in less than 3 years. We're looking at 10 shares of $5 million each - it's all spelled out in the enclosed literature. Let me know if there is any interest by Jeffrey Epstein, or anyone you know. Let me know what you need from me to help make this happen. Where possible -and necessary- we have agreed to pay finders fees that are convertible to share interest. Once we have the $50 million we'll move the program past feasability to the point where project financing is possible. The Delta contract is worth nearly $18 billion. The value of the jet fuel produced by the installation once complete will be around $60 billion - assuming a 20 year life. Thanks.
