Recarey to that affect. On or about September 27, 2005 at approximately 0915 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo and met with PB Sanitation worker Jesse Jones. I observed Jones enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo and remove one plastic bag of trash and place it in the back of an empty sanitation truck. I then followed Jones to a predetermined location and seized the trash from the truck. The trash was transported to the Palm Beach Police Department where I began sifting through its contents. There was a total of 1 white in color plastic bag which contained correspondence for 358 El Brillo. All documents of evidentiary value were removed and turned over to Det. Recarey for follow-up. On or about Monday October 3, 2005 at approximately 0915 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo and met with PB Sanitation worker Jeff Williams. I observed Williams enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo and remove several plastic bags of trash and place the contents into the back of an empty sanitation truck. I then followed Williams to a predetermined location and seized the trash from the truck. The trash was transported to the Palm Beach Police Department where I began sifting through its contents. There was a total of 7 white in color plastic bags with a red tie and 1 black in color bag which contained 2 white in color plastic bags with a red tie. Each of the bags contained documentation and correspondence for 358 El Brillo and Jeffrey Epstein. Inside of one of the white in color bags, I located a broken piece of a hard plastic or clear acrylic stick, which was shaped with small ridges. This device is commonly used as a sexual toy which is inserted into the vagina or anus for stimulation. This item, along with all documents of evidentiary value were removed and turned over to Det. Recarey for follow-up. On or about Tuesday October 4, 2005 at approximately 0928 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo and met with PB Sanitation worker Jeff Williams. I observed Williams enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo and remove several plastic bags of trash and place the contents into the side well of the sanitation truck. This side of the truck is separate from the rear of the truck and does not come into contact with other trash. I then followed Williams to a predetermined location and seized the trash from the truck. The trash was transported to the Palm Beach Police Department where I began sifting through its contents. There was a total of 2 white in color plastic bags which were tied at the top. Each of the bags contained documentation and correspondence for 358 El Brillo and Jeffrey Epstein. All documents of evidentiary value were removed and turned over to Det. Recarey for follow-up.
