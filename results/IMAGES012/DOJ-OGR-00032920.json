  "full_text": "Date: 4/20/06 Time: 13:02:26 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Incident Report Page: 83 Program: CMS301L Case No.: 1-05-000368 (Continued) On April 10, 2006, at approximately 2:30 p.m., I served AD at her residence in Royal Palm Beach. The subpoena was given to her mother, TD. I learned through one of the victims (AH) that she was personally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein. The source assured her she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating with law enforcement. She also stated she was told, \"Those who help him will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.\" I told her that tampering with a witness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious. I asked her who approached her during this encounter. She originally was reluctant to provide the name of the person who approached her to offer her not to testify because she felt they were still friends. On April 11, 2006, Det Dawson and I traveled to Tallahassee, Florida and met with the victim, identified as Brittney Beal, W/F, 02/01/1987, as the person who approached her in Royal Palm Beach while she was home during Spring Break in March 2006. She also stated she did not want to pursue the intimidation charges on Beal. She was concerned that the defense attorney was given a copy of the report as certain things she had told me in confidence were repeated to her by Beal. Prior to our departure, the victim was given a copy of her subpoena for the Grand Jury which was scheduled to commence April 18, 2006. Upon our return from Tallahassee, I notified the State Attorney's Office of what was told to me. I also notified them that the subpoenas were delivered to the witnesses and they would be calling for arrangements for the date and time needed for the Grand Jury. I spoke with ASA Weiss and informed her of the possible intimidation by the defense. On April 13, and April 14, 2006 I attempted contact on several occasions with ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic to ascertain when the victims needed to report for Grand Jury testimony. Messages were left on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the hours of 9:00 am and 11:30 am, I again left messages for ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic for either of them to return my call as I had not heard from the State Attorney's Office as to the time and date of the Grand Jury. At approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attorney's Office and located ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic in their offices. I entered ASA Belohlavic's office who informed me that she was going to return my call. She explained that an offer was made to the defense, Atty Guy Fronstin and Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg Assault with intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with adjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to psychiatric/sexual evaluation and no unsupervised visits with minors. When asked about the all the other victims, ASA Belohlavic stated that was the only offer made as to one victim. ASA Belohlavic's cell phone rang and went to voice mail. She checked her voice mail and played the message on speaker. The caller identified himself as 07/26/17 Page 2607 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032920",
