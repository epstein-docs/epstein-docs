RE: Freedom of Information Request Jeffrey Epstein Case Case Number 2005CF009454A Dear Ms. Belohlavek: Enclosed please find a copy of the Freedom of Information that was sent on August 14, 2006 to the Public Information Department of the State Attorney's Office and pending there ever since. I understand that at the moment the file cannot be released because it is still an \"active investigation\", yet all notices related to hearings on this case, or the dates, time and place of the hearings for this case are public record, even if the decision to postpone, cancel or change is done \"orally\" I was informed that the file in your office has no record of this request to change the date of the scheduled plea conference of January 4, 2008. The Freedom of Information Act was created to ensure transparency from our government officials and prevent sub rosa dealings. I respectfully request that I be informed of the the hearing dates related to this case. If the hearing date is changed \"orally\" I respectfully request pursuant to this FOIA that I still be contacted. It is imperative to ensure the trust that we have in your office that hearings are public and that the public be given due notice of them, particularly when a citizen pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act makes such a request. Thank you. 07/26/17 Page 49 of 104 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00031666",
