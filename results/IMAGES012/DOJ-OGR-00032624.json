The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N900LS registration,\nwas on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently\nacquired the services of a new attorney, and the fact that Epstein's\nhouse is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may\nbe in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence,\n358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting\nremodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed\ndriving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida\nregistration of F300QF. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north\non County Road. Det Caristo and I conducted surveillance on Norr.\nNorr traveled to several construction sites and checked on certain\njobs. Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det Caristo and I\ntraveled to Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue\nstripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was\nvisible on the bottom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane.\nWe maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a\ncaravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed\nseveral people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of\nthe executive team for Limited Inc. The executives were in Palm Beach\nCounty for an executive meeting for the day. They arrived in Palm\nBeach County on May 9, 2006 at 9:30 pm and were scheduled to leave on\nthe 10th at 5:00 pm.\n\nOn May 12, 2006, I met with ASA Lana Belohlavek at the State\nAttorney's Office. She explained that her boss, Barry Krischer, was\nrequesting this case be taken to the Grand Jury again. I explained to\nher I had requested arrest warrants for Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen,\nand Haley Robson. I asked that she either issue the warrants or\ndirect file, as so much time has elapsed since the original request to\nthe Grand Jury. She explained that the Palm Beach Police Department had\nconcluded the case in December of 2005 and has been waiting for the\ncase to go forward. Belohlavek stated the original offer was again\noffered to the new defense attorney. She was waiting for their answer\nby Friday May 19, 2006. She stated she would advise me of the answer.\n\n********************* NARRATIVE # 45 *********************\nReported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH                          6/05/06\n\n07/26/17                                  Page 2311          Public Records Request No.: 17-295\n                                                      DOJ-OGR-00032624",
