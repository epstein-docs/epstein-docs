  "full_text": "Epstein is alleged to have had sexual intercourse with some of the girls on three occasions, and paid one girl $1,000 after she objected during sex, police said. During the investigation, police said they learned of several more young women, all 18 years old or older, who consented to the \"same massage routine\" when they went to work for Epstein, according to the police report. Police said they learned of these women by searching Epstein's trash, through surveillance of his property and his private jet, and by reviewing telephone message books retrieved during a warrant search of the house. Epstein's spokesman, Sean Cassidy, said Epstein would have no comment for this story. Cassidy and Goldberger declined to answer questions. But Goldberger said in a prepared statement that \"the reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were not charged because the Palm Beach County state attorney's office questioned the credibility of the witnesses.\" The statement also said that \"a Palm Beach County jury found the allegations wholly unsubstantiated and not credible. Consequently, the grand jury chose not to accuse Mr. Epstein of anything beyond the solicitation of a prostitute.\" Goldberger also said Epstein passed a lie detector administered by a reputable polygraph examiner, in which he said he was unaware the girls were underage. Moreover, the police search of Epstein's home turned up no evidence to support the girls' allegations, Goldberger said. Solicitation of a prostitute is typically a misdemeanor. Epstein was indicted on a third-degree felony solicitation charge applied when there are three or more alleged offenses. After completing its investigation, Palm Beach police turned the case over to Krischer's office several months ago with a probable cause affidavit stating that Epstein should be arrested on four counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor and one count of lewd and lascivious molestation, all second-degree felonies. Janet Kinsella, spokeswoman for Palm Beach police, said the department handed the case to Krischer only because Epstein was not at his Palm Beach residence. \"The normal procedure when you want to arrest a person in another state is to file for an arrest warrant with the State Attorney's Office, which we did,\" Kinsella said. But rather than arresting Epstein on those charges, Krischer's office took the case before the grand jury. Police Chief Michael Reiter was so upset with Krischer's handling of the case that he suggested in a May 1 memo that Krischer disqualify himself from the case. Reiter said in",
