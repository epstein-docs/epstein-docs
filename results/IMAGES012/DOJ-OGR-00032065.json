  "full_text": "01/11/2008 21:25 5616404420 Page 06 The Fantasist Epstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they talked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was \"powerful\" and was afraid he would come after her family. A 17-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in which Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belittled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to model the underwear he'd bought for her. A 16-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was so upset by Epstein's removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship with the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein \"a pervert.\" Epstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were getting into and came willingly and were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom was a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with sex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein's love shack was like Hugh Hefner's. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cutting-edge porn men with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-school cheerleaders or college girls on break, and daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52, Epstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and Coeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that his activities would result in a police investigation. His claim that he'd given a total of $100,000 to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. \"The massage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It's part of a dancer's life to have daily massages,\" says the ballet's marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein's generosities preceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue masseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $100 an hour, and there were no happy endings. Next: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation. The 14-year-old told Epstein she was 18 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The law protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein's girls might have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and grown-up—it's difficult to believe Epstein wouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying that he believed the girls were 18.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered whatever they wanted from Epstein's chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One 16-year-old told police that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could happen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss's direction, he brought a pail of roses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama. \"He has never been secretive about the girls,\" Wolff says. \"At one point, when his troubles began, he was talking to me and said, 'What can I say, I like young girls.' I said, 'Maybe you should say, 'I like young women.' '\" Epstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein's friend Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor, provided the police and the state attorney's office with a dossier on a couple of the victims gleaned from their MySpace sites—showing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police complained that private investigators were harassing the family of the 14-year-old girl before she was to appear before the grand jury in spring 2006. The police said that one girl had called another to say, \"Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.\" By then, the case was politicized.
