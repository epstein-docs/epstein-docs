He, not that I would want anybody to get involved in this but I brought girls I didn't like and really frankly did not give a shit about. Girls that I knew were skanks that would do anything. Who, like, girls that would just like suck dick in the bathroom at school. Like not even people that I was friends with I'd just hear a rumor about a girl and be like hey I know a way you can make two hundred dollars. But I would tell them before they went I would tell them flat out like this is what you gotta do, are you cool with this cause I am not going to take you if you're not. And I told them, they all knew that I got paid to bring them. And I, it was _____, Mandy Biorklin. Mandy never did anything though, she took off her shirt - she was a little overweight so he didn't want anything to do with [laughs], she was my best friend so you know she was another story, I did care about her but um she lost her house and stuff and really needed money. She had, she was homeless she had nowhere to go. So she did it out of desperation. But um I, the only people I can think of was ____ and Mandy. I might have asked other people but I don't think I ever actually brought other people.\n\nDETECTIVE:\n\nOkay. Did anything ever happen between you and the two girls that you brought there?\n\nMandy, she was really nervous so she wanted me to go in with her. And I stayed with her, um, I took all my clothes off and I did my regular thing, and she just took her shirt off. And then he said 'Okay well ____ is gonna finish up here, do you want to go wait by the pool' and she went downstairs and went swimming and I was still naked.\n\nDETECTIVE:\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd that was that.\n\nDETECTIVE:\n\nOkay.\n\nShe got paid I think three, two or three hundred dollars for that, probably two because it was her first time. The way it went was if you worked there for the first like three times, you got paid two hundred dollars. After that, if you were persistent and worked all the time it was the on average three hundred dollars. Sometimes I got paid a thousand. Just for the same thing. No varying in activities, just sometimes I'd walk out of there with a thousand dollars or I mean I got lots of gifts, like I got lots of stuff from this guy. I don't know.\n\nDefense Transcript 07/26/17\n23 October 11, 2005 PBPD &\nPage 2362 Public Records Request No.: 17-295\nDOJ-OGR-00032675",
