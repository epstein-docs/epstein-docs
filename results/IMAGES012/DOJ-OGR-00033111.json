Page 123 1 laser color copied so that we have a copy, and I'm 2 assuming he'll get a copy to the court reporter, 3 too, to attach, actually a certified copy to the 4 deposition. 5 MR. GOLDBERGER: Done. 6 MR. LEOPOLD: That's if you agree to that. 7 If not, then I want to pull each one out and put 8 exhibit labels on them, which we should do before 9 we leave. 10 MR. GOLDBERGER: We're not going to do 11 either. I'll have copies sent to the court 12 reporter and she can attach them to the 13 deposition. 14 MR. LEOPOLD: So you're not going to agree 15 to what we talked about during the break then. 16 MR. GOLDBERGER: I'm not quite sure what 17 your asking me to do. Let me finish. 18 MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. Sure. That's fine. 19 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. If you want me to 20 go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office and make copies 21 and then I'll give those to the court reporter, 22 fine. All I'm saying is that I would avoid that 23 process. I would send copies to the court 24 reporter. But if it will make you happier -- 25 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not?
