  "full_text": "Probable Cause Affidavit\nPalm Beach Police Department\nAgency ORI# FLO 500600\n\nEpstein instructed the victim to leave her telephone number before she left and paid her three hundred dollars. Epstein left the room as the victim began getting dressed. The victim returned to the kitchen, where Robson was waiting for her. The victim made a comment to Robson she was paid three hundred dollars for the massage. Robson stated \"I know\" and revealed she had received two hundred for bringing her to Epstein.\n\nThe victim was shown a photo line up with Epstein's picture placed in position five. The victim immediately identified Epstein as the subject who massaged her vaginal area with the vibrator and masturbated simultaneously.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for the victim to assist with the Investigation. At our direction, the victim conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson's cellular telephone 561-308-0282. The victim, spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. The victim, asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, \"the more you do, the more you get paid.\" Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach was notified, and trash was collected at the residence. It revealed telephone messages for Epstein which stated Haley and the victim's name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed the victim to be ready to go work at Epstein's house. This arrangement was tape recorded from the victims voice mail.\n\nIt should be noted that during the taped interview with the victim, the description of the interior of the house was given. I personally have been in the house for a previous investigation at the El Brillo house in which Epstein was the victim, and found the victims description of the house to be accurate.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, Haley Robson was contacted at her home in Royal Palm Beach. Robson agreed to come to the station voluntarily to answer questions pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave at any time she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked how she became in contact with Epstein. Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend \"Molly\" in the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money.\n\nThe foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed before me this 20 day of September, 2005 by Det. Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.\n\nSignature of Police Officer (F.S.S. 117.10)\n\nState of Florida\nCounty of Palm Beach\n\nSignature/Arresting Officer\nDate: 09/20/2005\n\nPage 2 of 4\n07/26/17 Page 3 of 135 PPublic Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00031176",
