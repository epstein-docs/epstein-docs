  "full_text": "no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein. 3. It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and issues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases. 4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and necessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by Defendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and traumatic facts in separate depositions for each case. 5. It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this case if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same time. 6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.220(l)(1) provides that the Court may issue a protective order \"as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment, unnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the deposition.\" Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.220(h)(1) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe's circumstances will only be subject to one deposition: \"In any case, no person shall be deposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued on good cause shown.\" 7. This Court has the inherent authority to protect witnesses in a criminal case from potential emotional harm. State v. Ford, 626 So.2d 1338 (Fla. 1993); State v. Tarrago, 800 So.2d 300 (Fla. 3d DCA 2001). A requirement that a single deposition be taken by Defendant Epstein for both the civil and criminal cases will avoid unnecessary emotional harm to Y. Doe.
