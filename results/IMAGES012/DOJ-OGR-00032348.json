I was instructed by Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media related material from the residence.\n\nUpon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the left side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware sitting on floor next to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or features indicating a make or model. This CPU was powered off with the power cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the CPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor, printer, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, I observed an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware would allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPU s hard disk. The ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search and no external camera was located within this room.\n\nThe CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel LCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative of a second computer; however, no other computer was found. It appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices, i.e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media was found.\n\nAfter completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned all items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis via a property receipt.\n\nI was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden Room, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.\n\nDet. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana room, which is detached from the residence and located just south of the pool. In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office type setting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.\n\n07/26/17 Page 2035 Public Records Request No.: 17-295\nDOJ-OGR-00032348",
