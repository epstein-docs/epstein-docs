I informed him that if and when any charges would be presented I would notify him. The call was then terminated. Investigation continues. *************** N A R R A T I V E # 25 *************** NA Reported By: RECARBY, JOSEPH 12/15/05 NA Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 12/16/05 A review of the telephone message books, which were obtained during the search warrant, was conducted in which various messages from different dates were made to Jeffrey Epstein. The telephone message books have a duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been interviewed. The body of the messages was time of the day that they called for confirmation of \"work.\" Other names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, \"I have girls for him\" or \"I have 2 girls for him.\" These messages were taken by Sarah for Jeffrey Epstein. Based on the context of the body of the messages, I requested subpoenas for subscriber information on the telephone numbers and the time frame involved. Copies of the messages were made for evidentiary purposes. I obtained High School yearbooks for 2005, 2004 and 2003. I first reviewed the 2005 yearbook and located most of the girls I had spoken with. Additionally, I located at her residence in Loxahatchee. On December 8, 2005, Det. Caristo and I responded to in Loxahatchee. I located at her home. She advised she is attending High and is participating in the early release program so she can maintain her part time job. As she is still a minor, I left my business card to request an interview with her daughter. We then left the area. I also had previously researched the telephone number for \"Tatum\" and telephone number 561-640-7912. A subpoena had been issued for the information on 561-640-7912. The telephone number was registered to Scott Miller of 1558 Velvet Place E. A query of Tatum Miller revealed that she is the daughter of Scott Miller and is currently residing at 4938 21 Road North in West Palm Beach. Det. Caristo and I attempted contact with Miller with negative results. I left my business card on her front door requesting she return my call. We then responded to 1558 Velvet Place E in West Palm Beach. I also attempted contact with Mr. Miller with negative results. I left my business card for him to return my call. 07/26/17 Page 2031 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032344",
