Eaton removed her clothing, leaving her panties on, and wrapped herself with a towel for the massage. Eaton remembered that the door to the guest room was closed but not locked. As the therapist was working her back, the door was opened by Epstein and entered into the room. Eaton was trying to conceal herself as Epstein was talking to her about his chiropractic session. Epstein told Eaton turn over onto her back. Eaton eventually turned over exposing her breasts to Epstein as he applied pressure on her shoulder and her waist. Eaton stated Epstein \"popped\" her back. Eaton removed her self from the table, got dressed and left the house. Eaton further stated Burns had attempted to call her on several occasions to invite her back to Epstein's house to which Eaton replied \"I'm busy.\" Eaton advised she has not had contact with either Dana Burns or Jeffrey Epstein. It should be noted that her mother, Suzanne Eaton was present during the interview. The interview was concluded and we thanked them her for their time.  *****************************NARRATIVE #38*****************************  Reported By: RECARy, JOSEPH  1/31/06  Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A.  1/31/06  On January 27, 2006, I made telephone contact with Christina Venero, at 772-878-7280. Venero is a licensed massage therapist who had frequented the home of Jeffrey Epstein. Ms. Venero has been unable to meet with me in Palm Beach County, and because she lives and works in Port St Lucie, a telephone interview was conducted. I explained to Ms. Venero that there was an on going investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein.  Venero stated she knows Epstein and has been employed by him for approximately three years. Epstein has paid Venero to perform Swedish Massages (Deep Tissue) on him and other guests. Venero explained that approximately three year ago she met Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein through a mutual friend. Epstein and Maxwell were looking for a massage therapist. Venero stated since that time, she is notified when Epstein is coming to Palm Beach. Venero stated she comes to his house and provides the massage or massages. Venero explained she has also massaged his guests and assistants. Venero continued that she is paid $100.00 and hour for the massage.  I asked Venero if anything occurred during the massage that would have made her feel uncomfortable. Venero stated she only provided massages and that was it. She never was approached for anything else. I asked if Epstein ever asked her to rub his chest as that is not part of her massage. Venero explained that she was not Epstein's type. The girls she would see at Epstein's house were very thin, beautiful and without tattoos. Venero explained she has several tattoos that are visible. Maxwell and Epstein have commented negatively about her tattoos previously when she has provided massages.  07/26/17  Page 2602  Public Records Request No.: 17-295  DOJ-OGR-00032915",
