What are you doing?\" Reading a book,\" she replies, thinking, \"Isn't that obvious?\" You're in a restricted fishing area,\" he informs her. \"I'm sorry officer, but I'm not fishing, I'm reading.\" \"Yes, but you have all the equipment. For all I know you could start at any moment. I'll have to take you in and write you up.\" \"If you do that, I'll have to charge you with sexual assault,\" says the woman. \"But I haven't touched you,\" says the game warden. \"That's true, but you have all the equipment. For all I know you could start at any moment.\" \"Have a nice day ma'am,\" and he left. MORAL: NEVER ARGUE WITH A WOMAN WHO READS. IT'S LIKELY SHE CAN ALSO THINK. LOL, made me think of you lady!!
