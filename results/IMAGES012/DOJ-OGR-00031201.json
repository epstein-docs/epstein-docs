March 7, 3906 RICHARDSON'S CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS The top donations to gov. elect Bill Richardson's campaign came from: 1. Labor unions: $633,488 The top union donor was AFSCME, the public-employee's labor group, which gave $300,000 in cash contributions. AFSCME also produced its own radio and television ads during the Republican primary that were critical of GOP candidates. AFSCME is angling to persuade the Legislature and the governor to reinstate collective bargaining for state employees. Outgoing Gov. Gary Johnson allowed the previous agreement to expire, and Richardson has promised to work on a new agreement. The Communication Workers of America, which represents several thousand employees in New Mexico, contributed $100,000 through its political action committee in New Mexico. The American Federation of Teachers, one of two national teachers unions that represents New Mexico educators, gave $50,000. 2. Gambling interests: $648,392 This is a significant development in New Mexico campaign finances. In a matter of five years, gambling money has become one of the top influences in state politics. The top gambling contributor was the Downs at Albuquerque, which donated $100,000. The Downs has a relationship with the state because the racing license is regulated by the state Racing Commission.
