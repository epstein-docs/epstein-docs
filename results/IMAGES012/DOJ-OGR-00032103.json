  "full_text": "Mystery money man faces soliciting charge By NICOLE JANOK Palm Beach Post Staff Writer A part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey was jailed early Sunday with accused drug dealers, drunken drivers and wife beaters after he was charged with soliciting a prostitute. Manhattan money manager Jeffrey Epstein, 53, was picked up at his home on El Brillo Way at 1:45 a.m. He was released hours later on $3,000 bond. Epstein was indicted last week by a state grand jury, according to state attorney's spokesman Mike Edmondson. Despite Epstein's arrest, the indictment containing the allegations remained sealed Sunday and Edmondson provided no details. Unlike most accused johns, Epstein was charged with a third-degree felony instead of a misdemeanor. Under state law, a solicitation charge usually is elevated to a more serious felony when the defendant has at least two solicitation convictions. However, checks of court records here and in New York Sunday turned up no such convictions. Epstein could not be reached. Edmondson said he was being represented by West Palm Beach attorney Jack Goldberg, who declined comment. Epstein is the president of J Epstein & Co., a money management company based in Manhattan that caters to ultra-wealthy clientele, according to public records. See SOLICITING, 6B Jeffrey Epstein Indictment related to prostitution. 07/26/17 Page 64 of 151 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032103",
