Fronstin stated in the message, he spoke with his client, Jeffrey Epstein, and agreed to the deal. Fronstin asked to call off the grand jury as they would accept this deal. Belohlavic stated a probable cause would be needed to book Epstein in the county jail and would let me know as to when it would be needed. I explained my disapproval of the deal and not being consulted prior to the deal being offered. However I expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief Reiter call Barry Krisher about the deal. I left the area and returned to the police station where I briefed the Chief about the deal offered. I checked my voice mail messages and discovered a message from the stepmother for the victim. She was calling because the State Attorney's Office still had not returned any of her calls as to when they are needed for this case. I then called ASA Belohlavic's office and left messages for her to call the victims on this case and explained to them what the State Attorney's Office had done. On April 17, 2006, at approximately 4:30 pm, State Attorney Investigator Tim Valentine called to officially notify me of the cancellation of the Grand Jury. He requested I contact the victims that had been served to appear, to notify them of the cancellation. I advised Valentine that as this Grand Jury session was called based on the State Attorney's Office decision to have the victims heard by the Grand Jury that I felt it was the State's Attorney's Office responsibility to contact the victims and advise them of the reason they were no longer needed. ********************* END OF REPORT ********************* 07/26/17 Page 2608 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032921",
