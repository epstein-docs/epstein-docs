[REDACTED] was asked if he ever used a vibrator on her. [REDACTED] was aware of the vibrator but advised she never would allow him to use the vibrator on her. She described the vibrator as the large white vibrator with a huge head on the tip of the vibrator. She stated he kept the vibrator in a closet near the massage table.\n\n[REDACTED] stated that on October 3, 2005, she was contacted by Epstein's assistant, Sarah. Sarah had informed her that Jeff Epstein had rented her a new Nissan Sentra and she should come by the house to pick it up. Sarah informed [REDACTED] she would have the car for a month. [REDACTED] stated Epstein knew her car was not working properly and had missed appointments in the past because of her car being inoperable. [REDACTED] explained the car is currently parked next to the [REDACTED] gym field. I asked if she ever took any one to the house. [REDACTED] explained she took Lauren Murphy, a friend of hers who attended Royal Palm Beach High School, who has relocated to Orlando to attend college. I asked if she ever allowed another female in the room with her. [REDACTED] advised no one was brought into the room with her. At the conclusion of the interview, Det Dawson and I went to the Gym area of [REDACTED] and located the Silver Nissan Sentra bearing Florida tag X98-APM. The vehicle is registered to Dollar Rent A Car out of the Palm Beach International Airport.\n\nOn October, 11, 2005, Det Dawson and I met with [REDACTED] date of birth, [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] explained she had gone to Epstein's house since 2002, when she was sixteen years of age. Since then she has gone to the house hundreds of times. [REDACTED] stated she became his \"number one girl.\" She explained she was brought to the house to perform a massage by [REDACTED]. She would then start with a back massage. Epstein would roll on to his back and allow her to massage his chest area. [REDACTED] stated Epstein would then began to masturbate himself and at the same time would insert his fingers in her vagina and masturbate her with his fingers. [REDACTED] explained Epstein would continue this process until he ejaculated. He would then utilize a vibrator/massager on her vagina until [REDACTED] climaxed. [REDACTED] advised that during her frequent visits, Epstein asked for her real age, [REDACTED] stated she was sixteen. Epstein advised her not to tell anyone her real age. [REDACTED] advised that things escalated within the home as Epstein would instruct and pay [REDACTED] to have intercourse with his assistant, Nada Marcinkova. [REDACTED] explained the intercourse included using strap on dildos, large rubber penis, and other devices that Epstein had at his disposal. Epstein would watch them have intercourse and masturbate himself. Occasionally, Epstein would then join in during the female on female intercourse and provide oral sex to both [REDACTED] and Marcinkova. This occurred during the time [REDACTED] was sixteen years of age.\n\nThe foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed before me this 23 day of November, 2005 by\nDet Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.\n\nState of Florida\nCounty of Palm Beach\n\nSignature/Arresting Officer\n\nDate: 11/23/2005\n\nSignature of Police Officer (F.S.S. 117.10)\n\n07/26/17 Page 1 of 17 DOJ-OGR-00031873",
