I tried to pick my classes and they were all full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when registration opens and go on the computer and finish applying for classes because for some reason that shit will be open tomorrow. I don't know. My INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it this morning at 3am because I had to register today and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I'm so last minute on everything. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME WEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Hold On: Let me say that again) I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY WEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I also want to get a vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because apparently there are 'narc's' everywhere. Well, I'm really excited about starting class and meeting people. If you've read to this point then I feel bad for you. I'll stop torturing and finish this thing up,...... I hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry to those of you I promised to hang out with but couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch to all of those who know me. Wish me luck! 4:45 PM - 0 Comments - 0 Kudos - Add Comment Thursday, December 22, 2005 grown up Current mood: crappy I am leaving Will to go to n three days.
