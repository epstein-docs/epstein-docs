  "full_text": "Date: 2/17/06 Time: 11:36:35 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Incident Report Page: 27 Program: CMS301L Case No. : 1-05-000368 (Continued) Williams. I observed Williams enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo and remove several plastic bags of trash and place the contents into the bed of the sanitation truck. I then followed Williams to a predetermined location and seized the trash from the truck. The trash was transported to the Palm Beach Police Department where I began sifting through its contents, with the assistance of Det. Recarey. There were a total of 2 bags, one of which was white in color and tied in a knot at the top, and the other was a black in color bag, which contained two white in color trash bags along with loose debris. Each of the bags contained documentation and correspondence for 358 El Brillo and Jeffrey Epstein. All documents of evidentiary value were removed and turned over to Det. Recarey for follow-up. **************************** NARRATIVE # 7 **************************** NA Reported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 10/07/05 Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 10/07/05 I met with Det. Krauel and requested further assistance to maintain trash collections at Epstein's residence at 358 El Brillo Road. On October 3, 2005, at approximately 10:30 am, I was contacted by Sgt. Frick to respond to the Palm Beach Police Station. Det. Krauel had observed Jeff Epstein riding his bicycle on South County Road. Upon my arrival, I met with Sgt Frick who advised, as Epstein was currently in Town; we interviewed Haley Robson as to her involvement with Epstein and the girls that are brought to his house. As we were to interview Robson in the county, (outside of our jurisdiction), I contacted the State Attorney's Office Investigation Division, and made contact with Assistant Supervisor Investigator Carlos Ortiz. I requested assistance to interview Robson as the interview may occur in the county. Supervisor Ortiz assigned Investigator Mike Waites to assist us at the location and interview of Robson. Det. Dicks had responded to the address of Robson and viewed her vehicle parked in the driveway. Robson's vehicle was a red Plymouth Neon baring Florida Tag of H49-PKB was parked in the driveway of 12247 72nd Court in Loxahatchee. Sgt Frick and I responded to 120th Ave and awaited the arrival of Investigator Mike Waites. Upon his arrival, he was briefed that should she wish to be interviewed within her home he would be needed. However, should Robson agree to return to the police station for further questioning, he would not be needed. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. She agreed and wished to change her clothes prior to accompanying us back to the police station. At the conclusion of her changing clothes, she advised she was ready to go. I thanked Inv. Waites and advised she was going to voluntarily return to the police station. 07/26/17 Page 1999 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032312",
