Additionally, trash pulls were started on September 21, 2005. Sgt. Szarszewski made telephone contact with Tony Higgins, Supervisor of the Sanitation Department, and requested that trash be collected at the Epstein House located at 358 El Brillo in Palm Beach. Sgt. Szarszewski met with Sanitation worker, Jeff Williams and observed him enter the property at 358 El Brillo. Shortly thereafter, Williams exited the property and placed the three white trash bags in the empty well in the rear of the truck. Williams then drove away where he met with Sgt. Szarszewski who removed the bags from the well and placed them into one large black trash bag. The bag was returned to the Police Station where I was waiting for him. Upon his arrival, we inspected the bags where several notes and papers were found. These notes contained names of girls with times. Additionally, there was a note from . . . . . . and to Jeffrey Epstein on a notepad, which stated, \"For a good time call . . . . . . and at . . . . . . .\" Also, there was another telephone number on the note . Also found was a written note, which stated, \" . . . . . . can not come at 7 p.m. tomorrow because of soccer.\" These items were written on notepads that contain Jeffrey Epstein on the bottom of the notes.

A request for copies of the micro and standard size cassettes were requested from crime scene to familiarize myself with the interviews conducted. On September 23, 2005, the tapes were received and I began to become familiar with the interviews that were conducted. Det. Krauel had met with Town of Palm Beach Sanitation worker, Jeff Williams and observed him enter the property of 358 El Brillo. Shortly thereafter, Williams exited the property and placed the three white trash bags in the empty well in the rear of the truck. Williams then drove away where he met with Det.
