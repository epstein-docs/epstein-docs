Dawson was assigned to relieve Officer Munyan at 4:00 pm; he informed me that at approximately 8:00 pm, Epstein had left for the airport and his private jet was sitting on the tarmac. Epstein's private vehicle drove to the jet and unloaded packages into the jet. It appeared that Epstein left the county at this time. Surveillance will continue to determine when Epstein will return. Inv Continues. *************************NARRATIVE #3************************* Reported By: PARKINSON, GREGORY A. 9/23/05 Entered By: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 9/23/05 On Friday, September 23, 2005 at approximately 1:45 p.m., I began to copy a tape micro cassette, under case number 05-368 and property number 05-243, tape number 1. I placed the tape in the telex copy-et, series 2 machine and began to go through the copying process. Approximately 1/2 through the tape, the tape wrapped around the spindle and became locked and stretched the tape. I examined it and determined that it was in the best interest to leave it as it is as a prior copy had been made and turned over to Sergeant Frick. I immediately took the tape to Sergeant Frick and allowed him to examine it and then obtained the copy from him and Detective Recarey and brought the copy of the tape down and made a copy for him based on that. The tape was placed back in the original container and is retained in the evidence bag under the previously mentioned property number of 05-243. It is not advisable to attempt to copy this tape as further damage could result to the recorded material and there is an existing copy anyway. *************************NARRATIVE #4************************* Reported By: PARKINSON, GREGORY A. 9/26/05 Entered By: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 9/26/05 On 3-24-05 at 11:00 pm, a copy of tape 2 (case number 05-294) had been made for Det. Pagan by Evidence Specialist Annette Badger. The copy was turned over to Detective Recarey. On Friday, 09-23-05 at approximately 2:15 pm, I was in the process of reproducing audio tapes (micro and standard) to standard size when it was discovered, in the test review process, that tape number 2 was blank. I notified Sgt. Frick and Det. Recarey. I was informed that they had a prior copy and I could use it to make a master tape. I did so and when reviewing and signing the evidence sheet, I noticed Evidence Specialist Badger had written \"#2 is blank.\" I obtained that copy from Det. Recarey and made a new copy on a standard size tape. The new copy was placed in the evidence bag under 07/26/17 Page 2545 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032858",
