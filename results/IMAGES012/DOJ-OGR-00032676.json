I don't know, I don't think she still does, um, she may, may not. I don't know.\n\nDETECTIVE: Okay. Okay. Um, you went quite a few times with the Neon. And, you actually had an encounter with one of his doormen, when you were coming to get an envelope.\n\nThat was in my Riata, actually, I drove a little Riata. Um, I was coming to get an envelope with two thousand dollars in it, my Christmas bonus. Umm, oh my god it and the cop actually was like how do you know Jeffrey and I was like uhh I I'm friends with his girlfriend I use his pool every once in a while, or something, but that was crazy. Yeah he the housekeeper just was expecting me, but he didn't know, he was gone when I arrived and he came home and saw that there was a car and he didn't realize that it was my car. But he was expecting me um so he called the police and I was like what the fuck man I'm just coming here to pick up money. [giggles] But that was that.\n\nDETECTIVE: Okay. Let's get to the part where, um, things escalated. Um, I have to see something.\n\nUI\n\nDETECTIVE: Yeah, let me go ahead and stop this tape and start another one because it's almost at the end.\n\n[to friend] You don't have anything important to go do, do you? Okay.\n\nDETECTIVE: Okay, at this point I'm gonna go ahead and stop the tape. The time by my watch is approximately 5:02 p.m. [pause] Uh, 5:02, 5:03 p.m. Um, we're just about to get started with the, as it escalated. Um, tell me how it, how it happened.\n\nHe would just try things on occasion and if I let him do it then he would at the end put in more money without even like, it was kind of an unspoken thing, if it happened and I let it happen I'd get paid more. If it didn't happen then obviously it was the same. But um, on a few occasions I told you, that I did say no. Um, and I let it be UI and I'd say stop on my word, and he still gave me extra money on that one. But then the couple of times that I said no he talked",
