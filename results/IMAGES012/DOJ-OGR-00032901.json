I located the Simon Youth Foundation. I located inside the foundation and informed her that I was investigating a case against Jeffrey Epstein and knew she had been at the house. - started to cry and advised she had put that part of her life behind her. I explained that although she is seventeen years old I needed to inform her parents that she would be interviewed. She provided her home telephone number. I attempted contact and left voice mail messages at the house to speak with her parents. Det. Caristo and I then located at her residence located at West Palm Beach. I attempted to interview her about Jeffrey Epstein. She advised she is so in love with Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him. She further explained that she would not speak with us about him either negative or positive. She asked us to leave her property. I informed her that although she did not wish to speak with us, I had sufficient information at this point in the investigation to know she was at Epstein's house and provided girls to Epstein to work. I also explained that prior to our arrival at her residence I had telephone contact with her father, who was told she would be interviewed. is currently seventeen years old and as a juvenile, parental notification would be required. We then left the area and returned to the police station. While at the police station, I left another telephone message for parents. I began an analysis of Sarah Kellen's Cellular telephone. The telephone number 917-855-3363 is assigned to Sarah Kellen and the financially responsible party is Jeffrey Epstein of 457 Madison Ave. in New York City, New York. The time frame which was subpoenaed was September 2005, through October 2005. There were eighty seven pages of calls made either to the cell phone or from the cell phone. The local (561) numbers were analyzed. A spread sheet was prepared and placed into the attachment file of who was called. The unknown numbers were researched using FoneFinder.com and subpoenas were requested to determine subscriber information. This was done to identify additional victims or witnesses. The analysis revealed that Kellen had called the victim/witnesses frequently when Epstein was in the Town of Palm Beach to \"work.\" This confirms what the girls interviewed had previously stated. Kellen would notify them when Epstein was in town and their willingness to \"work.\" The CD was placed into evidence. Investigation Continues. *************************NARRATIVE # 30************************* Reported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 1/03/06 Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 1/03/06 On December 29, 2005, I received a facsimile from National Compliance 07/26/17 Page 2588 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032901",
