Investigation Continues. *************** NARRATIVE # 39 *************** Reported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 2/14/06 Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 2/16/06 On Friday, February 3, 2006, I had made arrangements to meet with Joanna Harrison at the Palm Beach Police Station. At approximately 1:00pm, Harrison and her friend, Victoria Bean arrived at the police station. During an interview with Harrison, she stated she met Epstein when she turned eighteen years old and was brought to Epstein's house to provide a massage. She advised this occurred on May of 2005. She advised Haley Robson had informed her if she wanted to provide a massage for $200.00. Harrison agreed and was brought to Epstein's house to provide a massage. Harrison stated she had been to the house on many occasions during the massage sessions. Harrison also stated she would remove her clothing to provide the massage on Epstein. Harrison advised Epstein would pay her $300.00 to rub his back, legs and chest. During the massages, Epstein would masturbate himself as she rubbed his chest. I asked her if Epstein ever touched her breasts during the massages. Harrison replied. \"Yes.\" I asked her if Epstein ever touched or massaged her vagina. Harrison stated he had on several occasions. I asked her if he ever penetrated her with either his penis or any other objects. Harrison stated that during a massage he inserted his fingers in her vagina as she massaged him. She stated this occurred one time only. Harrison stated the massage would be over when Epstein would climax onto a towel. I asked Harrison if she had any formal massage training to which she replied that she did not. Harrison was then asked if she ever brought anyone to the house to \"work.\" Harrison stated she brought two people to the house. She advised she received money for bringing people to the house to \"work.\" Harrison stated she brought a girl named \"-~ \" and her friend Tory Bean. Bean was still waiting for Harrison in the lobby of the police station. I thanked Harrison for her time and her cooperation and escorted her to the lobby. I asked Ms Bean if I could speak with her about this investigation. I 07/26/17 Page 2603 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032916",
