Um, what he specifically told me when I asked him the first time was 'Oh I'm a brain scientist' and I said what the fuck is a brain scientist? I was like that's not a real job you're like tell me the truth but anyway I took that as he, he told me his explanation was 'It's my job to know how people's brains work' and I said, whatever the fuck that means, whatever, you know you're just some old guy, and I went home. And then I looked up on the internet, um, about him and he was apparently an invest an he works for a financial firm and he would invest other people's money, like people sign their fortunes over to him he invests it and he gets commissions off of the money that they make.

I think the reason I held on so long is he promised me that I would get into NYU. That I would get into NYU and he would pay for it. And I waited and I waited and I scored great on my SATs, I got 4.0, like I did great in school. I filled out my application and he told me that it wasn't good enough. And, so I filled it out again and it was like three times so I'm pretty sure he wasn't checking into it he was just telling me that he was. But I think that has a lot to do with the reason I stayed there so long. Cause my dream was like right in front of me, you know. It was so close.\n\nDETECTIVE: Aside from having been with Na, uh, Nada or Nadia um was there anybody else that you brought to the house?\n\nI brought a few people.
