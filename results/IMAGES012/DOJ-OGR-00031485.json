When he purchased the car, how far were you, um.\n5 \n6 How old was I?\n7 \n8 DETECTIVE: Yeah.\n9 \n10 That what you mean? He bought the car in, [sigh] I gotta recall, I haven't thought about this in forever. Um. I can I can give you like four, four months that it possibly was during, but I can't specifically remember if it was before or after the New Year. Um, November, December, January February, that just passed.\n11 \n12 DETECTIVE: Of 2004?\n13 \n14 Wait a second.\n15 \n16 DETECTIVE: So were you a senior in high school when you had the car?\n17 \n18 Yeah, it was recently.\n19 \n20 DETECTIVE: Okay.\n21 \n22 It was, it was like, towards the middle and end of my school year. But I remember that for the last like six or eight weeks of high school, I didn't have a car cause I gave it back to him. Because he, he asked me to have sex with him and like, like suck him and stuff [giggles], and I was just like, no. Definitely not. I was like, I'll let you touch me but I'm not gonna do that.\n23 \n24 This is 2005, right?\n25 \n26 Yeah, the car was a Dodge Neon 2005. He got it for me before the New Year, because I remember I got it, it was an edition that was a year before they were supposed to come out. So if I got it, I obviously didn't get a 2006 cause that's this year. I got a 2005 Neon in 2004. Seven miles on it when I got it. That car was awesome [giggles].\n27 \n28 DETECTIVE: Okay.
