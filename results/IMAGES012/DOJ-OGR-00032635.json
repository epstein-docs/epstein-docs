My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.) The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank God she has me. I hope everything ends up being okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally stressed. I'm going through a really tough time. There's been so much death around me. It's really overwhelming. 2:09 PM - 0 Comments - 0 Kudos - Add Comment Friday, August 05, 2005 Freedom!!! Current mood: drained Hey, Wow! Not living with my parents anymore is da shit! For all of you who are not aware, I moved to Jacksonville. So far everything is going well.
