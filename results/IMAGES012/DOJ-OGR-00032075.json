  "full_text": "contains a parody of Affleck and Matt Damon making Good Will Hunting II, Affleck says to Damon, \"What do I keep telling you? You gotta do the safe picture, then you do the art picture. Then sometimes you gotta do the payback picture because your friend says you owe him. Then sometimes you gotta go back to the well.\" \"Sometimes you do Reindeer Games,\" Damon says derisively. \"That's just mean,\" Affleck whines. But it's a pretty accurate description of his career to date. \"Ben takes these franchise properties so he can go and experiment,\" says Harvey Weinstein. \"He believes in trying to stretch himself and not/keep doing the same thing,\" observes Bruce Willis, who starred with Affleck in Armageddon. \"He's an awesome actor, and I think he's going to do great things.\" Several years ago, in a televised interview on Inside the Actors Studio, Affleck said that his goal was to make big commercial movies. He has since revised his ambitions. \"That's an adolescent aspiration, in a way. I'd rather be in movies like Magnolia, which I think is a towering achievement. I'll continue to act, but I won't act in a way that requires me to hang my name out there and do a lot of publicity. I'll do character roles and focus on writing and directing. It doesn't require the same kinds of sacrifice, in terms of quality of life and personal life, and it's a more holistic approach to the process. It's become increasingly frustrating for me to have my role in the story-telling process limited to one character. You have to be respectful and judicious about your input when it's somebody else's project.\" Affleck has always impressed colleagues with his voracious appetite for information and skills. \"He has made it a point to learn everything he can about how the business works-not just the craft of acting, but from the producing standpoint, from the studio standpoint,\" says Jon Gordon, executive vice president of production at Miramax. \"He knows how deals work. It's what sets him apart. If we wanted to run a studio at some point, he could. He's about as sharp as they come.\" Affleck is already juggling his acting with screenwriting and such other commitments as Project Greenlight. the contest he and Damon started to help launch the careers of young filmmakers. Affleck's friends are certain he'll be directing soon. \"There's no question,\" Weinstein says. \"Both he and Matt. I think they're going to rewrite the rules. These guys can fix anything. There'll be home runs in both instances.\" But there are other thoughts tickling the back of Affleck's mind as well. A passionate liberal. he campaigned for Al Gore. and is extremely well informed. He entertains himself by writing imaginary political speeches in his head. He would rather discuss AIDS in Africa than his movie career. When Lopez goes to Affleck's mother's house for dinner, Weinstein reports, \"J. Lo told me that the conversation at the table is always about politics-about government initiatives. educational initiatives. what's going on in the day.\" Alvin Einbinder. In his 1989 deposition Epstein recalled that the partner who had made an \"issue\" of the matter was Marvin David-son. On March 9. Epstein said. he had met with Tarnopol and Einbinder again, and the two partners told him that the executive committee had weighed the offense. together with previous \"carelessness\" over expenses. and he would be fined $2.500. \"There was discussion whether, in fact, I had ever put in an airline ticket for someone else and not myself and I said that it was possible, ... since my secretary handles my expenses.\" Epstein told the S.E.C. In his 1989 testimony he stated that the \"Reg D\" incident had cost him a shot at partnership that year. What the S.E.C. seemed to be especially interested in was whether there was a connection between Epstein's leaving and the alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals Corporation? Jeffrey Epstein CONTINUED FROM PAGE 305 Bear Stearns and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear Stearns on March 12. The S.E.C. was tipped off that Epstein had information on insider trading at Bear Stearns. and it was therefore obliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testimony, given on April 1. 1981, Epstein claimed that he had found \"offensive\" the way Bear Stearns management had handled a disciplinary action following its discovery that he had committed a possible \"Reg D\" violation--evidently he had lent money to his closest friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said that he'd lent approximately $20.000 to Warren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action could have been considered improper, although Epstein claimed he had not realized this until afterward. According to Epstein. Bear Stearns management had questioned him about the loan around March 4. The questioners, Epstein said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and nection with your reasons for leaving the firm? A: I'm aware that there were many rumors. Q: What were the rumors you heard? A: Nothing to do with St. Joe. Q: Can you relate what you heard? A: It was having to do with an illicit affair with a secretary. Q: Have you heard any other rumors suggesting that you had made a presentation or communication to the Executive Committee concerning alleged improprieties by other members or employees of Bear Stearns? A: I, in fact. have heard that rumor, but it's been from Mr. Harris in our conversation last week. Q: Have you heard it from anyone else? A: No. A little later the interview focuses on James Cayne: Q: Did you ever hear while you were at Bear Stearns that Mr. Cayne may have trader or insider information in connection with St. Joe Minerals Corporation? A: No. Q: Did Mr. Cayne ever have any conversation with you about St. Joe Minerals? A: No. Q: Did you happen to overhear any conversa- So is Affleck planning to become the liberals' answer to Ronald Reagan? He admits that he entertains the thought of someday running for Congress, at least: \"I think there's a real nobility to public service. It would be fun to run on a platform I really believed in, without any of the kind of compromises people make--without being beholden to the win-at-all-costs mentality.\" And the invasion of privacy would be nothing new. \"What are you going to say about me that hasn't already been said? I don't cheat, I don't drink, I don't do drugs. I live a clean life,\" Affleck says, his eyes twinkling. \"He's only 30 years old,\" says Jennifer Todd. who co-produced Boiler Room. \"He still has an enormous amount of time to do things.\" Time, and drive. \"I think he's incredibly hungry,\" says Sean Bailey. who founded LivePlanet with Affleck. Damon, and Chris Moore. \"I think the guy has very grand aspirations. I don't think he's going to be content with just being a movie star. He knows he has the potential to do very big things.\" Such ambitions could be derailed by any number of miscalculations. including a private life that generates too many sensational headlines. but Affleck has a clear idea of the ultimate goal. \"On my deathbed. I have to be one who looks back and feels I lived a good and substantial and meaningful life.\" he says. In the meantime. how's there's a wedding to plan. = Page 36 of 151 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032075",
