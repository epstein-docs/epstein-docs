Virginia Mar 8, 2005 3:18 PM Remember when we did that thing where you called me and said \"We'll race!\" then we raced and you won, technically. And we bought matching shirts. Then you lit napkins on fire. That was a good day. You haven't seen it yet, but still, I saw you online and had to post first.... Remember when one of 24? when you dyed my hair blonde? when you used to climb on the counters? when you snuck out and left me a note to tell me that you had? when we washed our hair in the rain at city place? or layed on the stage and looked at I Spy books? ohmygoodness we have so many... you can remember the harder ones though---lol MWAH!
