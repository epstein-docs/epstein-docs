Um, at what point, from when he started just touching you to the point where he actually put his fingers inside of you?\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7 He did that once in the beginning, and at the time I was, um, dating somebody, and that person was aware of what I did. Um, and was like - this person, by the way, who said this stuff that I'm about to tell you is like now a crack-head, like on drugs, so they're way wack, they're like crazy. And he was actually my boyfriend, he goes 'Oh I have no problem with it, as long as he's not putting anything inside of you.'\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15 [First tape ends.]\n16\n17 [Second tape begins.]\n18\n19\n20 I wouldn't let him put anything in me until one day he did just out of nowhere. And I said wait a second my boyfriend, you know, we had this thing, you can't do that. You know, I'm, I'm allowed to work here as long as you don't do that. And he said ok. Well, a couple months later I guess he assumed me and my boyfriend had broken up, and he just did it one day, he just did it without asking or anything. And then I said what are you doing I said you know that's not cool and he goes 'Oh I thought we did that last time.' And I said no we did not do that last time. And, then he goes, uh and then he just offered me more money. He's like, 'Well why don't I just give you something extra and we can try this out.' And I was like [sigh] all right. Very hard guy to say no to. I don't know if any of you guys ever talked to him.\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33 DETECTIVE: Persistent.\n34\n35 Yeah.\n36\n37\n38 DETECTIVE: I haven't spoke with him but he is persistent from what I can tell.\n39\n40 //Oh, yeah. Well if you talk to him I mean he straight up tries to control the situation. Every, every word that comes out of your mouth it seems like he knows what you are going to say.
