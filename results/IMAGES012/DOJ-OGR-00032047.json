  "full_text": "Police kept watch on home, airport, sifted through trash\nEPSTEIN from 1B\nsuggesting that the county's top prosecutor disqualify himself.\n\"I must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office's handling of this matter has taken and consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from these cases,\" Reiter wrote in a May 1 memo to Krischer.\nWhile not commenting specifically on the Epstein case, Mike Edmondson, spokesman for the state attorney, said his office presents cases other than murders to a grand jury when there are questions about witnesses' credibility and their ability to testify.\nBy the nature of their jobs, police officers look at evidence from a \"one-sided perspective,\" Edmondson said.\n\"A prosecutor has to look at it in a much broader fashion,\" weighing the veracity of witnesses and how they may fare under defense attorneys' questioning, he said.\nEpstein's attorney, Jack Goldberger, said his client committed no crimes.\n\"The reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were not charged because the Palm Beach County state attorney questioned the credibility of the witnesses,\" Goldberger said.\nA county grand jury \"found the allegations wholly unsubstantiated and not credible,\" and that \"why his client was not charged with sexual activity with minors,\" he said.\nGoldberger said Epstein passed a lie detector test administered by a reputable polygraph examiner in which he said he did not know the girls were minors.\nAlso, a search warrant served on Epstein's home found no evidence to corroborate the girls' allegations, Goldberger said.\nAccording to police documents:\n\nA Palm Beach Community College student said she gave Epstein a massage in nude, then brought him six girls, ages 14 to 16, for massage and sex-tinged sessions at his home.\n\nA 27-year-old woman who worked as Epstein's personal assistant also facilitated the liaisons, phoning the PBCC student to arrange for girls when Epstein was coming to town.\n\nPolice took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses.\nThey contend that on three occasions, Epstein had sex with the girls.\nThe chief's letter\nSee the letter Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter wrote to State Attorney Barry Krischer on the Epstein case.\nPalmBeachPost.com\nA money manager for the ultra-rich, Epstein was named one of New York's most eligible bachelors in 2003 by The New York Post.\nHe reportedly hobnobs with the likes of former President Clinton, former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers and Donald Trump, and has lavish homes in Manhattan, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands.\nHe has contributed tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic Party candidates and organizations, including Sen. John Kerry's presidential bid, and the Senate campaigns of Joe Lieberman, Hillary Clinton, Christopher Dodd and Charles Schumer.\nGoldberger is one of five attorneys Epstein has retained since he became the subject of an investigation, Edmondson said.\nAmong others: Alan Dershowitz, the well-known Harvard law professor and author, who is a friend of Epstein.\nDershowitz could not be reached for comment.\nPolice said the woman who enlisted young girls for Epstein was Haley Robson,\n20, of Royal Palm Beach.\nRobson has worked at an OI-Garden restaurant in Wellington and said she was a journalism major at Palm Beach Community College when she was questioned by police last October.\nShe has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for comment.\nRobson said she met Epstein when, at age 17, a friend asked her if she would like to make money giving him a massage.\nShe said she was driven to his five-bedroom, 7 1/2-bath home on the Intracoastal Waterway, then escorted upstairs to a bedroom with a massage table and oils.\nEpstein and Robson were both naked during the massage, she said, but when he grabbed her buttocks, she touched she didn't want to be touched.\nEpstein said he'd pay her to bring him more girls - the younger the better, Robson said.\nWhen she tried once to bring a 23-year-old woman to him, Epstein said she was too old, Robson said.\nRobson, who has not been charged in the case, said she eventually brought six girls to Epstein who were paid $200 each time, Robson said.\n\"I'm quoted her as saying.\nThe girls knew what to expect when they were taken to Epstein's home, Robson said.\nGive a massage - maybe naked - and allow some touching.\nOne 14-year-old girl Robson took to meet Epstein led police to start the investigation of him in March 2005.\nA relative of the girl called to say she thought the child had recently engaged in sex with a Palm Beach man.\nThe girl then got into a fight with a classmate who accused her of being a prostitute, and she couldn't explain why she had $300 in her purse.\nThe girl gave police this account of her meeting with Epstein:\nShe accompanied Robson to Epstein's house on a Sunday in February 2005.\nOnce there, a woman assistant told the girl to follow her upstairs to a room featuring a mural of a naked woman, several photographs of naked women on a shelf, a hot pink and green sofa and a massage table.\nShe stripped to her bra and panties and gave him a massage.\nEpstein gave the 14-year-old $300 and she and the other girls left, she said.\nRobson told her that Epstein paid her $200 that day.\nOther girls told similar stories.\nIn most accounts, Epstein's personal assistant at the time, Sarah Kellen, now 27, escorted the girls to Epstein's home.\nKellen, whose most recent known address is in North Carolina, has not been charged in the case.\nPalm Beach police often conducted surveillance of Epstein's home, and at Palm Beach International Airport to see if his private jet was there, so they would know when he was in town.\nPolice also arranged repeatedly to receive his trash from Palm Beach sanitation workers, collecting papers with names and phone numbers, sex toys and female hygiene products.\nOne note stated that a female could not come over at 7 p.m. because of soccer.\nAnother said a girl had to work Sunday - \"Monday after school?\"\nAnd still another note contained the work hours of a girl, saying she leaves school at 11:30 a.m. and would come over the next day at 10:30 a.m.\nOnly three months before the police department probe began, Epstein donated $90,000 to the department for the purchase of a firearms simulator, said Jane Struder, town finance director.\nThe money was never returned to Epstein on Monday, she said.\nStaff writers Andrew Marra and Tim O'Meilia and staff researcher Angelica Cortez contributed to this story.\nlarry_keller@pbpost.com",
