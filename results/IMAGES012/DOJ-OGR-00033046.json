It calls for 4 a yes or no. 5 THE WITNESS: Okay. No. 6 BY MR. TEIN: 7 Q. Now you can explain the answer that your 8 counsel stopped you from explaining. 9 A. Okay. I work at Quarterdeck and people 10 were telling me that people were looking for me. So yes, 11 I was aware that people were searching for me. But I had 12 no idea who they were or what their intentions were. But 13 I thought they were just people I didn't want to talk to. 14 So I just didn't want to talk to them. And every time 15 they'd come to work I wasn't there. And so happens the 16 night that they came in me and my friend switched name 17 tags. No big deal. 18 Q. That's a lie, isn't it? 19 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Don't answer that 20 question. That's harassment and I will not allow 21 it. He could ask the questions and we'll allow a 22 jury to make that determination, but not counsel. 23 I will not allow her to answer that 24 question. 25 MR. TEIN: Certify it.
