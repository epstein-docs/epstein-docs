  "full_text": "TOWN OF PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT A NATIONAL AND STATE ACCREDITED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY July 24, 2006 HAND DELIVERED Dear Mr. [REDACTED] Your daughter [REDACTED] was the victim of a crime which has been investigated by the Palm Beach Police Department and subsequently referred for prosecution to the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office. You may be aware that Jeffrey Epstein was indicted on charges of solicitation for prostitution by a State of Florida grand jury last week and turned himself in at the Palm Beach County jail on July 23, 2006. While I do not speak for them, it is my understanding that is the full context in which the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office intends to address the charges that involved the crime in which your daughter was victim. Please know that it is the role and responsibility of law enforcement to investigate crime and to refer appropriate charges to the prosecutor for consideration. I believe that the Palm Beach Police Department has acted competently and responsibly in carrying out this role. Should you have any questions concerning the state prosecution of this matter, they are best addressed by the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office. I do not feel that justice has been sufficiently served by the indictment that has been issued. Therefore, please know that this matter has been referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine if violations of federal law have occurred. In the event that the FBI should choose to pursue this matter, the Palm Beach Police Department will assist them in their investigation of potential violations of federal law. Please feel free to contact me at (561) 838-6100 should you have any questions. Sincerely, Michael S. Reiter Chief of Police MSR:nt 345 South County Road • Palm Beach, Florida 33480-4443 • (561) 838-6100 • Fax (561) 835-4700 • www.palmbeachpolice.com 07/26/17 Page 36 of 124 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00031757",
