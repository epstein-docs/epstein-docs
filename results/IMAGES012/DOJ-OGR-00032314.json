Robson stated that she and _________, picked up the victim at the (later identified as ___________), victim's house. They traveled to Epstein's House and entered through the kitchen door. They met with the house chef and Epstein __________. The victim was introduced to Epstein while they were in the kitchen area. Sara led the victim upstairs and Epstein went upstairs. When the massage was over, the victim returned to the kitchen area. Robson stated she was paid $200.00 for bringing the victim to Epstein's. Robson stated the victim told her she was paid $300.00 for the massage. Back in the vehicle, Robson asked the victim what happened. The victim told her about the massage and then they went shopping. Robson stated the victim was the last person she brought to Epstein. She further stated that she had changed her cellular number to avoid being contacted by Sara. She continued that when Epstein announces that he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sara would contact Robson to arrange girls for Epstein. Sarah, later identified as Sarah Kellen Date of Birth 05-25-1979, had told Robson that Jeff likes to have his fun with the girls. Robson stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sara still tries to call the house and leaves messages. With the assistance of Robson, we were able to identify __________, DOB ____________, and __________, DOB ___________. Sgt Frick entered the room and explained that based on her own statements, she had implicated herself with bringing underage girls to Epstein's house. Robson was aware of what she had stated and wished to assist further in hopes to receive a lesser charge. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for the girls she had mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which they lived. As Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record any conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment I'm like a Heidi Fliess. (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California).
