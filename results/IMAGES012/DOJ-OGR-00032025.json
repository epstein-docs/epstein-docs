  "additional_notes": "The document appears to be a scan of four 'Important Message' forms, likely from a business or organizational setting. The forms contain handwritten notes and messages, primarily related to phone calls and requests to return calls. The document quality is generally good, with some minor variations in handwriting legibility. The presence of a 'Public Records Request No.' suggests that this document was obtained through a public records request."
