I responded to [redacted]. During the interview, Radabaugh stated she knew I would be speaking with her. Radabaugh stated she was first introduced to Epstein when she turned eighteen years old. Radabaugh stated she was sure of her age as it was her senior year in Palm Beach guy. She advised she was brought there to make money and was told she would have to provide a massage to this Palm Beach guy. She remembered she met Epstein and his assistant Sarah in the kitchen area. She stated she was taken by one of her friends, Kara. She stated she went upstairs with Sarah while Epstein got ready for the massage. He exited his bathroom naked and Radabaugh turned around. Epstein asked her if being naked offended her. Radabaugh stated it made her uncomfortable. Epstein then put on a towel and lay on the table. Radabaugh stated she rubbed his back and feet. She stated she had no massage training or experience. Radabaugh stated during the massage, Epstein attempted to touch her buttocks. Radabaugh pulled away as he touched her buttocks. She told him again she was uncomfortable with him touching her. Epstein then cut the massage short and became upset with her. Epstein paid her $200.00 for the massage and told her to leave the house. Radabaugh never returned to the house. She did advise of one time she went with [redacted] however she waited in the car for [redacted] as she did not want to go into the house. At the conclusion of visit with Epstein they left the area. Radabaugh stated she had heard from other girls that have gone to the house that Epstein now required them to do the massage naked and allow him to touch them in their private areas for monies. The interview was concluded as Radabaugh did not have any other information to provide. I then learned from the original victim, [redacted] the defense attorney had learned of her identity. I spoke with the father of the victim, who stated there has been a private investigator on his house photographing his family and chasing visitors who come to the house. He provided a Florida License of E79-4EH. This vehicle is registered to Ivan Robles of West Palm Beach. Robles is a private investigator intern who is licensed by the state. I informed the State Attorney's Office of the above information. I received the Grand Jury subpoenas to be delivered to three victims for a Grand Jury session to be held on April 18, through April 20, 2006. Investigation continues. *************************NARRATIVE # 42 ************************* Reported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 4/14/06 Entered By: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 4/18/06 The Grand Jury Subpoenas were personally served to the individuals they were issued to.
