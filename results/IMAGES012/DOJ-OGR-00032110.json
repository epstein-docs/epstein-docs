Toward te end of this massage, Epstein grabbed [withheld] and turned her over onto her stomach on the massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. [Withheld] stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her vagina. [Withheld] became very upset over this. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued to pump inside of her. She screamed \"No!\" and Epstein stopped. Epstein did not ejaculate inside of her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid her a thousand dollars for that visit. Umm, can you say really, really fucked up? Read the thing for yourself, if you care to, but we just felt it necessary to point out that this story is more than lube and vibrators and massages. This is like, allegedly, really messed up stuff. And we are more than astounded at the press for not bringing these accusations to light. Very, very disappointing. Maybe since he's friends with Bill Clinton, Ron Burkle, and Donald Trump, accusations that he's raping little girls can be omitted from the news.
