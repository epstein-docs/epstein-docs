  "full_text": "Probable Cause Affidavit\nPalm Beach Police Department\nAgency ORI# FLO 500600\n\nadvised this continued to escalate during two years. The routine became familiar to Epstein's assistant Sarah (later known as Sarah Kellen) would telephone her every time Epstein was in the Town of Palm Beach and would place appointments for her to visit and work for Epstein. stated Epstein would photograph Marcinkova and her naked and having sex and proudly display the photographs within the home. stated during one visit to Epstein's house in which she provided a massage to Epstein, his female friends, Nada Marcinkova, was also present. provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her would fondle each others breasts and kiss for Epstein to enjoy. Towards the end of this massage, Epstein grabbed and turned on to her stomach on the massage bed and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her vagina. became upset over this. She said her head was being held against the bed forcibly, as he continued to pump inside her. She screamed \"No!\" and Epstein stopped. She told him that she did not want to have his penis inside of her. Epstein did not ejaculate inside of her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid her a thousand dollars for that visit. stated she knows he still displays her photographs through out the house.\n\nOn October 12, 2005, Det Dawson and I met with Lauren Murphy who stated during a sworn taped statement, that nothing happened between her and Epstein. Murphy appeared nervous during the interview. I assured her that I have spoken with other people who advised different. Murphy stated on several occasions she provided a massage to Epstein. She stated she was brought to the Epstein house in March of 2005. approached her and asked her if she wanted to \"work\". made the arrangements with Sarah, Epsteins assistant. Murphy who has no formal training in providing massages, stated she provided a massage, fully clothed for $200.00 . As I sensed hesitancy in her answers, I asked Murphy if she had been contacted by anyone from Epstein's organizations or his house. Murphy stated she was interviewed already by a private investigator for Epstein. He identified himself as \"Paul\" and inquired about the police investigation, and left his telephone numbe 305-710-5165 for additional contact. Murphy provided no additional information, as it appeared her responses were almost scripted.\n\nOn November 6, 2005, at approximately 3:30 pm, I met with at the Palm Beach Police Department. During the sworn taped statement, advised she was at Jeffrey Epstein's house one time, approximately two months ago. She was approached by a girl, , who was dating her room mate to make some quick money. advised she needed to make some quick cash to make the rent that month. She agreed to go to the house.
