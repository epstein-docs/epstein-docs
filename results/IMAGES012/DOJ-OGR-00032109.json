But that's because we are just now going through The Smoking Gun report on the Donald Trump role model and fellow scumbag, who not only recently arrested for soliciting sex from a masseuse, but who, according to \"a former houseman,\" received three massages a day from girls who appeared to be, at the most, sixteen or seventeen years old. In case you haven't seen it, things get much worse. He also reported that following Epstein massages he sometimes had to \"wash off a massege/vibrator and a long rubber penis\" which had been left in a sink. Alfredo Rodriguez, a former house manager, told probers that he \"knew\" Epstein's masseuses were still in high school. Rodriguez also told of having to \"wipe down\" vibrators and sex toys post-massage and returning them to an armoire near Epstein's bed. It gets worse. About 22 pages of allegedly underage girls traipsing in and out of the house and engaging in various sexual acts with Epstein worse. The affidavit from a 14 year old girl, who's name is being withheld, names Haley Robinson and Sara Keller as two of the girls involved in this sick story.

What did jump out at us, however, more than the egg-shaped penis or the photos of naked underage girls all over his house, was the part which accounts Epstein's alleged rape of a sixteen year old girl.
