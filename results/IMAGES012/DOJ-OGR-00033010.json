Asked and 3 answered, for the fourth time. 4 MR. TEIN: You are improperly objecting, 5 Mr. Leopold. You have no grounds to object. And 6 that's not an objection. 7 MR. LEOPOLD: It is an objection. 8 MR. TEIN: Then terminate the deposition if 9 you think it's been asked and answered. 10 MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, I am not precluded 11 from just making an objection to the form of the 12 question. As the courts well know, and if you 13 practice here in West Palm Beach, many of the 14 judges require you to set the objection with 15 specificity. And I will do that. And if you 16 don't want me to, you can make the record. But I 17 will do that. 18 MR. TEIN: Here's what we'll do, Ted. You 19 can -- I will allow you to reserve an objection to 20 form for every single one of my questions. 21 Otherwise, all you're doing is obstructing. 22 MR. LEOPOLD: I won't do that. 23 MR. TEIN: Of course; because you want to 24 obstruct. 25 MR. LEOPOLD: All right.
