  "full_text": "ontains a parody of Affleck and Matt Da-\non making Good Will Hunting II. Affleck\nsys to Damon, \"What do I keep telling you?\nbu gotta do the safe picture, then you do\nte art picture. Then sometimes you gotta\ndo the payback picture because your friend\nsys you owe him. Then sometimes you got-\ntgo back to the well.\"\n\n\"Sometimes you do Reindeer Games,\"\nDamon says derisively.\n\n\"That's just mean,\" Affleck whines.\n\nBut it's a pretty accurate description of\nhis career to date. \"Ben takes these franchise\nproperties so he can go and experiment,\"\nsays Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\"He believes in trying to stretch himself\nand not/keep doing the same thing,\" ob-\nserves Bruce Willis, who starred with Affleck\ninArmageddon. \"He's an awesome actor,\nand I think he's going to do great things.\"\n\nSeveral years ago, in a televised interview\non Inside the Actors Studio, Affleck said that\nhisgoal was to make big commercial movies.\nHe has since revised his ambitions. \"That's\nan adolescent aspiration, in a way. I'd\nrather be in movies like Magnolia, which I\nthink is a towering achievement. I'll con-\ntinue to act, but I won't act in a way that\nrequires me to hang my name out there\nand do a lot of publicity. I'll do character\nroles and focus on writing and directing. It\ndoesn't require the same kinds of sacri-\nfice in terms of quality of life and person-\nal life, and it's a more holistic approach to\ntheprocess. It's become increasingly frus-\ntrating for me to have my role in the story-\ntelling process limited to one character. You\nhave to be respectful and judicious about\nyour input when it's somebody else's project.\"\n\nAffleck has always impressed colleagues\nwith his voracious appetite for information\nand skills. \"He has made it a point to learn\neverything he can about how the business\nworks--not just the craft of acting, but\nfrom the producing standpoint, from the\nstudio standpoint,\" says Jon Gordon, exec-\nutive vice president of production at Mira-\nmax. \"He knows how deals work. It's what\nsets him apart. If he wanted to run a studio\nat some point, he could. He's about as\nsharp as they come.\"\n\nAffleck is already juggling his acting with\nscreenwriting and such other commitments as Project Greenlight. the contest he\nand Damon started to help launch the ca-\nreers of young filmmakers. Affleck's friends\nare certain he'll be directing soon. \"There's\nno question,\" Weinstein says. \"Both he and\nMatt. I think they're going to rewrite the\nrules. These guys can fix anything. They'll\nbe home runs in both instances.\"\n\nBut there are other thoughts tickling the\nback of Affleck's mind as well. A passion-\nate liberal, he campaigned for Al Gore,\ncares deeply about political issues, and is\nextremely well informed. He entertains him-\nself by writing imaginary political speeches\nin his head. He would rather discuss AIDS\nin Africa than his movie career.\n\nWhen Lopez goes to Affleck's mother's\nhouse for dinner. Weinstein reports, \"J.Lo\ntold me that the conversation at the table is\nalways about politics--about government\ninitiatives, educational initiatives, what's go-\ning on in the day.\"\n\nAlvin Einbender. In his 1989 deposition Ep-\nstein recalled that the partner who had made\nan \"issue\" of the matter was Marvin David-\nson. On March 9. Epstein said. he had met\nwith Tarnopol and Einbender again, and the\ntwo partners told him that the executive com-\nmittee had weighed the offense, together with\nprevious \"carelessness\" over expenses, and\nhe would be fined $2,500.\n\n\"There was discussion whether, in fact, I\nhad ever put in an airline ticket for some-\none else and not myself and I said that it\nwas possible, ... since my secretary han-\ndles my expenses,\" Epstein told the S.E.C..\nIn his 1989 testimony he stated that the\n\"Reg D\" incident had cost him a shot at\npartnership that year.\n\nWhat the S.E.C. seemed to be especially\ninterested in was whether there was a con-\nnection between Epstein's leaving and the\nalleged insider trading at St. Joe Minerals\nby other people at Bear Stearns:\n\nQ: Sir. are you aware that certain rumors may\nhave been circulating around your firm in con-\nnection with your reasons for leaving the firm?\nA: I'm aware that there were many rumors.\nQ: What were the rumors you heard?\nA: Nothing to do with it.\nQ: Can you relate what you heard?\nA: It was having to do with an illicit affair\nwith a secretary.\nQ: Have you heard any other rumors suggest-\ning that you had made a presentation or com-\nmunication to the Executive Committee con-\ncerning alleged improprieties by other mem-\nbers or employees of Bear Stearns?\nA: I, in fact. have heard that rumor, but it's been\nfrom Mr. Harris in our conversation last week.\nQ: Have you heard it from anyone else?\nA: No.\n\nA little later the interview focuses on\nJames Cayne:\n\nQ: Did you ever hear while you were at Bear\nStearns that Mr. Cayne may have trader or ir:\nsider information in connection with St :\nMinerals Corporation?\nA: No.\nQ: Did Mr. Cayne ever have any conversation\nwith you about St. Joe Minerals?\nA: No.\nQ: Did you happen to overhear any conversa-\nPage 17 of 151\nPublic Records Request No.: 17-295\n\nJeffrey Epstein\n\ncontinued from page 305 Bear Stearns\nand other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear\nStearns on March 12. The S.E.C. was tipped\noff that Epstein had information on insider\ntrading at Bear Stearns, and it was therefore\nobliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testi-\nmony, given on April 1, 1981, Epstein claimed\nthat he had found \"offensive\" the way Bear\nStearns management had handled a disci-\nplinary action following its discovery that he\nhad committed a possible \"Reg D\" viola-\ntion--evidently he had lent money to his clos-\nest friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said\nthat he'd lent approximately $20,000 to War-\nren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action\ncould have been considered improper, al-\nthough Epstein claimed he had not realized\nthis until afterward.\n\nAccording to Epstein, Bear Stearns man-\nagement had questioned him about the loan\naround March 4. The questioners, Epstein\nsaid, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and\n07/26/17\n\nSo is Affleck planning to become the lib-\nerals' answer to Ronald Reagan? He admits\nthat he entertains the thought of someday\nrunning for Congress, at least: \"I think there's\na real nobility to public service. It would be\nfun to run on a platform I really beli: ed\nin, without any of the kind of compromi :\nes\npeople make--without being beholden\nthe win-at-all-costs mentality.\"\n\nAnd the invasion of privacy would be\nnothing new. \"What are you going to say about me that hasn't already been said? I\ndon't cheat. I don't drink, I don't do drugs.\nI live a clean life,\" Affleck says, his eyes\ntwinkling.\n\n\"He's only 30 years old,\" says Jennifer\nTodd. who co-produced Boiler Room. \"He\nstill has an enormous amount of time to\ndo things.\"\n\nTime, and drive. \"I think he's incredibly\nhungry.\" says Sean Bailey. who founded\nthe media and production company Live-\nPlanet with Affleck. Damon. and Chris\nMoore. \"I think the guy has very grand\naspirations. I don't think he's going to be\ncontent with just being a movie star. He\nknows he has the potential to do very big\nthings.\"\n\nSuch ambitions could be derailed by any\nnumber of miscalculations. including a pri-\nvate life that generates too many sensational\nheadlines, but Affleck has a clear idea of\nthe ultimate goal. \"On my deathbed. I have\nto be one who looks back and feels I lived\na good and substantial and meaningful\nlife.\" he says.\n\nIn the meantime. howe :r. there's a wed-\nding to plan. =\n\nDOJ-OGR-00032056",
