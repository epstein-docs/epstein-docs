Most everyone on the Street has heard of him, but nobody seems to know what the hell he is up to. Which is just the way he likes it. \"My belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't get a straight answer from him,\" says one well-known investor. \"He once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I've also heard that he manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the Wizard of Oz -- there may be less there than meets the eye.\" Says another prominent Wall Streeter: \"He is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque figure. He likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of alloofness.

He is an enthusiastic member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations. He dresses casually -- jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers -- and is rarely seen in a tie. Indeed, those close to him say the reason he quit his board seat at the Rockefeller Institute was that he hated wearing a suit. \"It feels like a dress,\" he told one friend. Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. \"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,\" Trump booms from a speakerphone. \"He's a lot of fun to be with.

No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\" But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about Epstein: As some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. \"I invest in people -- be it politics or science. It's what I do,\" he has said to friends.
