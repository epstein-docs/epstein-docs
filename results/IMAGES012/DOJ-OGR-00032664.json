He bought the car in, [sigh] I gotta recall, I haven't thought about this in forever. Um. I can I can give you like four, four months that it possibly was during, but I can't specifically remember if it was before or after the New Year.

But I remember that for the last like six or eight weeks of high school, I didn't have a car cause I gave it back to him. Because he, he asked me to have sex with him and like, like suck him and stuff [giggles], and I was just like, no. Definitely not.

He got it for me before the New Year, because I remember I got it, it was an edition that was a year before they were supposed to come out. So if I got it, I obviously didn't get a 2006 cause that's this year. I got a 2005 Neon in 2004. Seven miles on it when I got it.
