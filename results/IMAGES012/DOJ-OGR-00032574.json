  "full_text": "She advised sometime during the massage, Epstein grabbed her buttocks and pulled her close to him. She said she was uncomfortable by the incident involving Jeff. At the conclusion of the massage, she was paid $200.00 for the massage. I asked if she has any formal training in massages to which she replied no. I asked her if Robson received any monies for taking her to perform the massage. [Redacted] stated Robson also received money for taking her there but was unsure in the amount of monies Robson received for bringing her to Epstein. [Redacted] stated she returned to Epstein's house on another occasion with Robson and another girl [Redacted]. [Redacted] stated she waited in the kitchen with Robson, while [Redacted] was taken upstairs by Sara. [Redacted] stated she only did the massage once as she was uncomfortable with the whole experience. At the conclusion of the interview, the tape was stopped. I was informed that Sara had attempted to reach [Redacted] via cell phone. A voice mail message on October 4, 2005 at 10:59 am, revealed a female voice who identified herself as Sara who requested [Redacted] to call her back reference the police questioning. This voice mail message was recorded onto a micro cassette. [Redacted] provided the incoming telephone number as 917-855-3363. [Redacted] stated she inadvertently told [Redacted] about the police investigation because [Redacted] had called her to tell her about how she just received a rental car from Jeff Epstein. [Redacted] had called her to tell her that she was given a rental car, a 2005 Silver Nissan Sentra, to utilize to visit family and visit Jeff. [Redacted] asked her what was going on at the house that the police would be asking questions. [Redacted] stated [Redacted] then called Jeff and Sara and asked what was going on reference the ongoing police investigation. According to [Redacted], Sara has since then been trying to contact her to ask about the police questions. I instructed [Redacted] not to contact Sara and do not provide any more information to as she would notify Jeff Epstein and Sara what was transpiring. On October 4, 2005, I made telephone contact with [Redacted] who had left several messages on voice mail. During the message, she advised she was not completely truthful when we met in person but would like to speak with me to advise what had happened. She further advised she did not want to speak of this incident in front of her mother. At approximately 15:48 pm I made telephone contact with [Redacted]. During a taped recorded statement, [Redacted] stated the following: Approximately a year ago, when she was sixteen years of age, Robson took her to Jeff's house twice. The first time she went, Haley Robson drove to the house. They entered through the kitchen area where she was introduced to Sara and Jeff. She was taken upstairs to a bedroom by Sara and set the room up with a massage bed and brought out the oils to use. Jeff then entered the room wearing a towel. He laid on the table and picked out a lotion for [Redacted] to rub on him. At one point during the massage, he tried to remove her shirt at which point she became very upset and discontinued the massage. Both and Jeffrey had a verbal disagreement at which time she left without being paid. She got with Haley Robson who was sitting in the kitchen and told her 'let's go.' [Redacted] advised she received no money for that day [Redacted] also said that Haley Robson had told her if she was uncomfortable with what was going on, to let him know and he'll stop. She knew that the more you do the more you get paid. [Redacted] advised that several weeks later, she agreed to be taken a second time by Haley Robson. Once they arrived at the residence, Haley Robson sat in the kitchen, and Sara took her upstairs to the master bedroom again. Sara set the room up with a massage bed and brought out the oils to use. Jeff then entered the room wearing a towel. He laid on the table and picked out a lotion for [Redacted] to rub on him. At one point during the massage, he tried to touch her buttocks. 07/26/17 Page 6 Page 2261 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032574",
