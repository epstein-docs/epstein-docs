It was really pretty. Not that that makes a difference.\n9\n10\n11 DETECTIVE: And you gave it back?\n12\n13 Yes.\n14\n15 DETECTIVE: Was this after you graduated from high school, or\n16\n17 No, I, I gave it back before I graduated. It got too, it got too sticky for me. He wanted more than I was willing to give. I didn't wanna, I didn't want to um suck his dick, I didn't want to have sex with him. I never did that and I wanted to be able to walk away from this saying that I, saying that I never did that. And I'm glad that I did.\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23 DETECTIVE: Okay.\n24\n25 So I just gave it back I said, I don't need this, I don't need a car.\n26\n27\n28 DETECTIVE: Okay.\n29\n30 But I lied to him when I gave it back, I didn't want to burn my bridges because he was a spectacular connection to have. Spectacular. Even if I didn't - even when I didn't work for him, until this day, he is so aw - he is so, I haven't talked to him in like a couple months, but um, as far as he can, as far as he knows, he's, well, I don't know how to, I'm sorry. [stutters] So many things are going through my head right now and I'm just getting a little tongue-tied. Um. If I called him today he would give me as much money as I asked him for, he doesn't know that I hate the way I do. I kept that connection. I figured he used me, I'd be able to use him. Um, I hate to say that but I figured if I wanted to use him I could.\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43 DETECTIVE: Okay.
