Remember when you were crying on the bus and you used my jacket sleeve as a tissue? Remember when Kurt pulled my chair from beneath me and I didn't notice till my ass was on the floor? Remember when things weren't so difficult, when not everything had an ulterior motive, when you didn't need to put time aside just to relax? This is making me feel old. Hi . Here's to good, bad and ugly times and more to come. the tragic tale of you and me Mar 8, 2005 7:19 PM That reflector should have been attached to the ground. And you say you're cursed, any other reflector would have been stuck there for another hundred years, but you pulled up to the one that wasn't. The sky was beautiful that night, and so were you. Virginia Mar 8, 2005 7:18 PM wait wait wait...remember when you used to want a mustang?? lol and then we continually called out colors whenever we saw one and i convinced you that YOU were not like everyone else, why should you drive a car that everyone else owned... the tragic tale of Mar 8, 2005 7:08 PM",
