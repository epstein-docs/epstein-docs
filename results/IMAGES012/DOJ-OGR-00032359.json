After the massage, Epstein ordered his houseman at the time to drive the girls home. The employee was to drop off the girls at their house and watch them go inside their house.\n[REDACTED] could not remember who the houseman was. She stated Epstein and his assistant Sarah would call her at her father's house to arrange for her to come and \"work.\" She advised each time she returned to the house, Epstein would do the same thing. [REDACTED] stated it was a routine with Epstein. She would rub his feet and calves. He would then turn over and begin to touch her on her vagina area. The only difference was that it was done without panties. Epstein's fingers would stroke her vagina area as he would masturbate and finally climax and the massage would be over. She was paid $200.00 each time she went. Each time she went she was reminded not to speak of what happened at the house and that she would be contacted again. She began to purposely miss the calls when either Sarah or Epstein would call her. She once brought a friend, \"Brandy\" unknown last name, to work for Epstein. She was paid $200.00 for bringing Brandy. [REDACTED] stated she no longer returned to work for Epstein. She also stated that she wanted to notify the police of what happened at the house. [REDACTED] stated she was scared of what could have happened to her or her family if she notified authorities.\nOn January 10, 2006, I received the results from the subpoena from BellSouth Telecommunications for telephone number [REDACTED]. The number is assigned to [REDACTED] father in Palm Beach Gardens. I also received the results from Western Union which confirmed the money order sent to [REDACTED] from Jeffrey Epstein in New York City. The \"wire\" was sent by Jeffrey Epstein of 457 Madison Ave in New York City on December 23, 2004 at 12:05 pm. The amount of $222.00 was charged to Epstein's credit card so that [REDACTED] could receive $200.00 in [REDACTED]. The twenty-two dollars was for processing and local fees to send the money via Western Union. A copy of the check presented to [REDACTED] was also attached to the receipt of the wire. This confirmed what [REDACTED] was also advised she received as a Christmas bonus from Epstein.\nInvestigation continues.\n****************** NARRATIVE # 35 ******************\nReported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 1/10/06\nEntered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 1/10/06\nI received and reviewed the Cingular Wireless results from the subpoena requests for subscriber information for telephone numbers 561-818-8361, 561-389-6874 and 561-309-0079.
