Please note New Albany Country Club is not included until 1/1/2005 All Cash Flows are used to pay NACO Interest and any excess is applied as a NACO Capital Account reduction. (2) The Annual Interest rate is 6.5%. Interest is calculated on the previous Year's Ending Capital Account Balance. Interest Payments and Capital Additions /(Reductions) are applied at the end of Calendar Year. (3) Positive Cash flow from Managed Properties is applied in the following order: (i) Interest Expense for NACO if any, and the balance applied to reduce the NACO Capital Account until be Zero. If the Cash Flow is insufficient to pay the current interest expense then the unpaid portion of the interest will be added to the Capital Balance. Interest on Georgetown's Capital accrues and is added to the Capital Account. Interest for 2004 is based on 124 days and a 366 day year. (4) Capital Account Balance as of January 1, 2002 is $83,000,000. NACO is allocated $75,000,000 or 88.24% and Georgetown is allocated $10,000,000 or 11.76%. Thereafter, the Capital Account Balance is the sum of the Capital as of January 1, 2002 plus Additions and less any Reductions. The Capital Account Balance is as of the end of each Calendar Year.
