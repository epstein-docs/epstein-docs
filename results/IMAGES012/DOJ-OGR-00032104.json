National magazines have described him as a \"mysterious billionaire\" who lives in a 45,000-square-foot New York City mansion.\n\nHe has been in trouble before. In 1993, he and two other defendants were charged in federal court with three counts of postal larceny and theft and one count of property theft. Epstein plead guilty to a single charge of conspiring to steal U.S. Treasury checks from residential mailboxes and received 5 years' probation. The remaining charges were dropped.\n\nSince then, Epstein's name has turned up in New York City's tabloids. The New York Post noted he flew President Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his private Boeing 727. In 2003, the paper dubbed him one of the Big Apple's \"top studs.\"\n\nIn 2004, Epstein bid against Trump for a 43,000-square foot Palm Beach estate once owned by healthcare magnate Abe Gosman. Trump topped Epstein with a $41.35 million bid.\n\nStaff Researcher Angelica Cortez contributed to this story.\n\nnicole_janok@pbpost.com\n\n07/26/17 Page 65 of 151 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032104",
