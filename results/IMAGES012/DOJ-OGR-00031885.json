Robson advised the victim was the youngest as she was fourteen when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when they arrived. They were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked her if the victim was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew the victim wanted to make money. She approached the victim and explained about going to work for Jeff. The victim agreed and arrangements were made to bring the victim to Epstein's house on a weekend. Robson stated that she and (Later identified as ) picked up the victim at the victim's house. They traveled to Epstein's House and entered through the kitchen door. They met with the house chef and Epstein's assistant Sarah, the blond woman referred by the victim. The victim was introduced to Epstein while they were in the kitchen area. Sarah led the victim upstairs and Epstein went upstairs. When the massage was over, the victim returned to the kitchen area. Robson stated she was paid $200.00 for bringing the victim to Epstein's house. Robson stated the victim told her she was paid $300.00 for the massage.\n\nRobson stated the victim was the last person she brought to Epstein's house. She further stated that she had changed her cellular number to avoid being contacted by Sarah. Robson stated Sarah (Later identified as Sarah Kellen) is Epstein's personal assistant.
