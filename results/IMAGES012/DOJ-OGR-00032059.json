  "full_text": "Jeffrey Epstein\nhe is winning. Whether in conversations or negotiations, he always stands back and lets the other person determine the style and manner of the conversation or negotiation. And then he responds in their style. Jeffrey sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick a fight, but if there is a fight, he will let you choose your weapon.\"\nOne case is rather more serious. Currently, Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on loans from his private-banking arm for $20 million. Epstein claims that Citibank \"fraudulently induced\" him into borrowing the money for investments. Citibank disputes this charge.\nThe legal papers for another case offer a rare window into Epstein's finances. In 1995, Epstein stopped paying rent to his landlord, the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his office in the Villard House. He claimed that they were breaking the terms of the lease by not letting his staff in at night. The case was eventually settled. However, one of the papers filed in this dispute is Epstein's financial statement for 1988, in which he claimed to be worth $20 million. He listed that he owned $7 million in securities, $1 million in cash, zero in residential property (although he told sources that he had already bought the home in Palm Beach), and $11 million in other assets, including his investment in Riddell. A co-investor in Riddell says: \"The company had been bought with a huge amount of debt, and it wasn't public, so it was meaningless to attach a figure like that to it ... the price it cost was about $1.2 million.\" The co-investors bought out Epstein's share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately $3 million. At that time, when Epstein was asked, as a routine matter, to sign a paper guaranteeing he had access to a few million dollars in case of any subsequent disputes over the sale price, Wexner signed for him. Epstein has explained that this was because the co-investors wanted an indemnity against being sued by Wexner. One of the investors calls this \"bullshit.\"\nEpstein's appointment to the board of New York's Rockefeller University in 2000 brought him into greater social prominence. Boasting such social names as Nancy Kissinger, Brooke Astor, and Robert Bass, the board also includes such pre-eminent scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph Goldstein. \"Epstein was thrilled to be elected,\" says someone who knows him.\nAfter one term Epstein resigned. According to New York magazine, this was because he didn't like to wear a suit to the Rockefeller board meetings. A \"board member recalls that he was \"arrogant\" and \"not a good fit.\" The spokesperson admits that it is \"infrequent\" for board members not to be renominated after only one term.\nStill, the recent spate of publicity Epstein has inspired does not seem to have fazed him. In November he was spotted in the front row of the Victoria's Secret fashion show at New York's Lexington Avenue Ar-mory; around the same time the usual coterie of friends and beautiful women were whisked off to Little St. James (which he tells people has been renamed Little St. Jeff) for a long weekend.\nThanks to Epstein's introductions, says Martin Nowak, the biologist finds himself moving from Princeton to Harvard, where he is assuming the joint position of professor of mathematics and professor of biology. Epstein has pledged at least $25 million to Harvard to create the Epstein Program for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office at the university. The program will be dedicated to searching for nature's algorithms, a pursuit that is a specialty of Nowak's. For Epstein this must be the summit of everything he has worked toward; he has been seen proudly displaying Harvard president Larry Summers's letter of commitment as if he can't quite believe it is real. He says he was reluctant to have his name attached to the program, but Summers persuaded him. He rang his mentor Wexner about it, and Wexner told him it was all right.\nAn insatiable, restless soul, always on the move. Epstein builds a tremendous amount of downtime into his hectic work schedule. Yet there is something almost programmed about his relaxation: it's as if even pleasure has to be measured in terms of self-improvement. Nowak says that, when he goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean, they'll get up at six and, as the sun rises, have three-hour conversations about theoretical physics. \"Then he'll go off and do some work, re-appear, and we'll talk some more.\"\nAnother person who went to the island with Epstein, Maxwell, and several beautiful women remembers that the women \"sat around one night teasing him about the kinds of grasping women who might want to date him. He was amused by the idea. ... He's like a king in his own world.\"\nMany people comment there is something innocent, almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein. They see this as refreshing, given the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan Dershowitz says that, as he was getting to know Epstein, his wife asked him if he would still be close to him if Epstein suddenly filed for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied, \"Absolutely. It would be a lot more interesting in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his it...\nCREDITS\nFASHION\nCover: Ben Affleck's Double RL T-shirt from Double RL, NYC, and L.A., or go to www.polo.com; for Levi's jeans, call 800-USA-LEVI; Deborah Wakin for Art Mix (the Agency).\nPage 96: Chrome Hearts shirt from Chrome Hearts, NYC, or call 212-327-0707; for Ray-Ban sunglasses, call 888-LUXOTTICA.\nPage 123: Peter Cincotti's Emporio Armani shirt from Emporio Armani boutiques nationwide; Ralph Lauren suspenders from selected Polo Ralph Lauren stores; Kim Meehan for Walter Schupfer Management\nPage 140: Peter Cincotti's shirt by Thomas Pink; suit by Giorgio Armani; tie by DKNY; Brioni coat by special order from selected Brioni stores.\nPage 151: Lev Glazman and Alina Roytberg styled by Jane Hershios.\nPage 160: Styled by Angela Groff at Ennis, Inc.\nPage 214: for June Havoc's Gina Simonelli Designs scarf, available by special order, call 978-499-2915.\nPage 220: Bernadette Peters's Donna Karan New York dress from Donna Karan New York stores nationwide and Bergdorf Goodman, NYC.; Paul Smith Women coat from Henri Bendel, NYC, and Traffic, L.A.; Chanel jewelry and gloves from Chanel boutiques nationwide, or call 800-551-0005; Narciso Rodriguez shoes from Jill Kim, Santa Monica, Calif., and Capital Cherie N.C.\nPage 223: Agnes Bruckner's Tom Ford for Yves Saint Laurent Rouge earrings from Yves Saint Laurent Rouge boutiques, NYC, and Hourtan.\nPage 226: Dyan Cannon styled by Linda Medvene; top and pants by Dolce & Gabbana, from Dolce & Gabbana, Beverly Hills; jewelry by Wendy Walker, from Wendy Walker, L.A.; shoes by Jimmy Choo, from Jimmy Choo, Beverly Hills.\nPages 276-77: Ben Affleck's Guess shirt from Guess stores nationwide, or go to www.guess.com; Versace boots from Versace boutiques worldwide, or go to www.versace.com, or call 888-3VERSACE\nPages 278-79: Double RL T-shirts from Double RL, NYC, and L.A., or go to www.polo.com; Chrome Hearts long sleeved shirt from Chrome Hearts, NYC, or call 212-327-0707; for Ray-Ban sunglasses, call 888-LUXOTTICA.\nPage 281: Tommy Hilfiger jacket from Tommy Hilfiger stores worldwide, or call 800-TOMMY4U; Double RL T-shirt from Double RL, NYC, and L.A., or go to www.polo.com; for Levi's jeans, call 800-USA-LEVI\nPublic Records Request No.: 17-295\nDOJ-OGR-00032059",
