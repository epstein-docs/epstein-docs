Sometimes he just asked me to take off my clothes and like, he would have to do work, and he'd be sitting at his desk or something and I'd just be naked there watching television or reading a book but I'd be naked. Or, um, sometimes he wanted to just watch TV or read and he'd lay in his bed and he'd ask me to just take my clothes off and lay with him. And that's it, not touch him or anything and I'd get paid three hundred dollars for that for twenty minutes. Um, sometimes he'd just invite me over for breakfast or dinner, or just to use the swimming pool, and I'd get paid for that too.\nOkay.\n[sigh] I'd get paid just to hang out with him. That's it. And if, if the money wasn't there, I'd not been there, I wouldn't have ever been in that house.\nOkay. Um. When he started to touch you, um.\nI have a question.\nYeah.\nBefore I say anything else. Um, is there a possibility that I'm gonna have to go to court or anything? Like, that's a possibility, right?\nWell, here's the thing. When this is all said and done, we're gonna sit down we're gonna discuss this. I mean, what he did to you is a crime. I'm not going to lie to you. You are a victim.\n//Will you consider rape? Like, will you consider that to be rape, what he did?\nWhen he put himself inside you, without permission, forcibly //I didn't say yes or anything, he just, like I was standing up, and the table is about like my hip length, he just pushed me down.\n//That, that, that is a crime.\nOkay.",
