  "full_text": "personality Donald Trump-sometimes seem not all that clear as to what he actually does to earn his millions. Certainly, you won't find Epstein's transactions written about on Bloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms. \"The trading desks don't seem to know him. It's unusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow,\" says a high-level investment manager. Unlike such fund managers as George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose client lists and stock maneuverings act as their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret, bar one client: billionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chairman of Limited Brands. Epstein insists that ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he has managed money only for billionaires-who depend on him for discretion. \"I was the only person crazy enough, or arrogant enough, or misplaced enough, to make my limit a billion dollars or more,\" he tells people freely. According to him, the flat fees he receives from his clients, combined with his skill at playing the currency markets \"with very large sums of money,\" have afforded him the lifestyle he enjoys today. Why do billionaires choose him as their trustee? Because the problems of the mega-rich, he tells people, are different from yours and mine, and his unique philosophy is central to understanding those problems: \"Very few people need any more money when they have a billion dollars. The key is not to have it do harm more than anything else.... You don't want to lose your money.\" e has likened his job to that of an architect-more specifically, one who specializes in remodeling: \"I always describe [a billionaire] as someone who started out in a small home and as he became wealthier had additions. He added on another addition, he built a room over the garage ... until you have a house that is usually a mess.... It's a large house that has been put together over time where no one could foretell the financial future and their accompanying needs.\" He makes it sound as though his job combines the roles of real-estate agent, accountant, lawyer, money manager, trustee, and confidant. But, as with Jay Gatsby, myths and rumor swirl around Epstein. Here are some of the hard facts about Epstein-ones that he doesn't mind people knowing: He grew up middle-class in Brooklyn. His father worked for the city's parks department. His parents viewed education as \"the way out\" for him and his younger brother. Mark, now working in real estate. Jeffrey started to play the piano-for which he maintains a passion-at five, and he went to Brooklyn's Lafayette High School. He was good at mathematics, and in his early 20s he got a job teaching physics and math at Dalton, the elite Manhattan private school. While there he began tutoring the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace Greenberg and was friendly with a daughter of Greenberg's. Soon he went to Bear Stearns, where, under the mentorship of both Greenberg and current Bear Stearns C.E.O. James Cayne, he did well enough to become a limited partner-a rung beneath full partner. He abruptly departed in 1981 because, he has said, he wanted to run his own business. Thereafter the details recede into shadow. A few of the handful of current friends who have known him since the early 1980s recall that he used to tell them he was a \"You think you know him and then you peel off another ring of the onion.\" UNREAL ESTATE From top: the \"leather room\" in Epstein's house, where \"tea\" is served to guests; Epstein at his Zorro ranch in 1991 with his \"best friend,\" Ghislaine Maxwell; Epstein in 1979. \"bounty hunter,\" recovering lost or stolen money for the government or for very rich people.

Since Leslie Wexner appeared in his life-Epstein has said this was in 1986: others say it was in 1989, at the earliest-he has gradually, in a way that has not generally made headlines, come to be accepted by the Establishment.
