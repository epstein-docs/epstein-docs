I'm at. I love it here. My dorm is so big and nice, compared to most of the other dorms on campus. I've been going to class now for three weeks and I love it. As a matter of fact, I'm doing quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in love with the weather, most of the time is perfect. It's beautiful up here. This weekend Will is visiting and I am so excited. I'm goin'na show him all over. We're going to have the best time! Hopefully, everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this pace I'll have a descent chance at the dean's list. OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss everyone!

I've been so busy; all I want to do is sleep. I moved into my dorm yesterday but I still have alot of stuff to buy to make it comfortable. My room is a suite, which is awesome. There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky enough to get one. I only have one roomate to deal with and the room is a decent size so I can have privacy too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement, however, I am sad also. I don't know what's going on,..... I miss Will,.....I guess he misses me, but who knows,..... ::sigh:: I'm not used to falling asleep by myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked women on his wall. Everything's different.
