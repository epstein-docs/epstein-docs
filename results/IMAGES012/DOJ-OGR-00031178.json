During a sworn taped statement     stated she met Jeffrey Epstein through Haley Robson. Robson would approach females who wished to work for him.     stated she was offered to work for him but declined.     explained that \"work\" means give massages. She was asked about any formal training in providing massages which she said no.     said she accompanied Robson and other females who taken to Epstein's house to provide massages. She further stated she had been to the house approximately 4 or 5 times in the past year. Each time any girl was taken to Epsteins house, they were previously told they would have to provide a massage, possibly naked. It was also told that should Epstein require them to do anything extra, and they were not comfortable with the request, just to tell him and he would stop.     stated Robson received $200.00 for each girl she brought over to massage Jeffrey Epstein. When I asked which girl appeared to be the youngest, she replied, the victim,     stated she looked really young, fifteen years old at the most.     further stated she did not know the victim personally.     stated she only went to the house to accompany Robson.\n\nAs Robson knowing the age of the victim, solicited the victim to commit a lewd a lascivious act and based on the above facts, I have sufficient probable cause to arrest Haley Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Acts to a victim under the age of 16.\n\nThe foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed before me this 20 day of September, 2005 by Det.
