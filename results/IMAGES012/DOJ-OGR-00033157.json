GOLDBERGER\nJASON S.WEISS\nBoard Certified Criminal Trial Attorney\nMember of New Jersey & Florida Bars\nDecember 3, 2009\nBarbara Burns, Esquire\nState Attorney's Office\n401 North Dixie Highway\nWest Palm Beach, Florida 33401\nRE: State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein\nCase No. 2008CF009381A\nDear Barbara,\nPursuant to our telephone conversation of November 30, 2009 and your subsequent email to me, I am providing the following information to you concerning Jeffrey Epstein's air travel from May 1, 2009 through November 30, 2009.\nAs you know, Mr. Epstein was in the custody of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office until July 22, 2009. I have confirmed that since Mr. Epstein's release from custody, he has traveled twice by air. The first trip was on September 14, 2009 when he traveled by helicopter to Miami to meet with counsel. He returned that day from Miami to Palm Beach County by automobile. Larry Visoski was the pilot and Nadia Marcinkova was the only other passenger. Both the trip and the mode of transportation were pre-approved by probation. On August 27, 2009 Mr. Epstein flew on a single engine Cessna aircraft to Sikorsky Helicopters in northern Palm Beach County. Larry Visoski and Nadia Marcinkova accompanied Mr. Epstein on this short flight. Once again the trip and the method of transportation were pre-approved by probation. There have been no other aircraft flights taken by Mr. Epstein during the time period. I am told there are not flight logs kept for the helicopter but I am enclosing the fuel receipt for the Miami helicopter trip as well as another document confirming the September 14, 2009 Palm Beach - Miami helicopter flight. I am also enclosing documents for the August 27, 2009 Cessna flight to Sikorsky Helicopters.\nOn another note, there appears to be false information being presented to either the State Attorney's Office or the Probation Office about Mr. Epstein allegedly violating the terms of his probation. None of this is true and in fact Mr. Epstein has an unblemished record with probation without any violations since his being placed on supervision. I note that many of the false allegations against Mr. Epstein have been brought by the Scott Rothstein law\nOne Clearlake Centre, Suite 1400 | 250 Australian Avenue South | West Palm Beach, FL 33401\np 561.659.8300 f 561.835.8691 www.agwpa.com Public Records Request No. 19-372\nDOJ-OGR-00033157",
