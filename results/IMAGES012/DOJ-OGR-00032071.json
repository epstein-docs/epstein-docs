  "full_text": "O\nn Manhattan's\nUpper East Side, home to some of the most expensive real estate on earth, exists the crown jewel of the city's residential town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door, huge arched windows, and nine floors, it sits on-or, rather, commands-the block of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of proportion with its four- and five-story neighbors, it seems more like an institution than a house. This is perhaps not surprising-until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private school. Now it is said to be Manhattan's largest private residence.\nInside, amid the flurry of menservants attired in sober black suits and pristine white gloves, you feel you have stumbled into someone's private Xanadu. This is no mere rich person's home, but a high-walled, eclectic, imperious fantasy that seems to have no boundaries.\nThe entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed eyeballs: these, the owner tells people with relish, were imported from England, where they were made for injured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, which does have a painting, in the manner of Jean Dubuffet... but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any case, guests are like pygmies next to the nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior.\nDespite its eccentricity the house is curiously impersonal, the statement of someone who wants to be known for the scale of his possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey Epstein, 50, admits to friends that he likes it when people think of him this way. A good-looking man, resembling Ralph Lauren, with thick gray-white hair and a weathered face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit shirts, and loafers. He tells people he bought the house because he knew he \"could never live anywhere bigger.\" He thinks 51,000 square feet is an appropriately large space for someone like himself, who deals mostly in large concepts-especially large sums of money.\nGuests are invited to lunch or dinner at the town house-Epstein usually refers to the former as \"tea,\" since he likes to eat bite-size morsels and drink copious quantities of Earl Grey. (He does not touch alcohol or tobacco.) Tea is served in the \"leather room,\" so called because of the cordovan-colored fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered in a leopard print, and on the wall hangs a huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding an opium pipe and caressing a snarling lionskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and guests by the menservants in white gloves.\nOutstairs, to the right of a spiral staircase, is the \"office,\" an enormous gallery spanning the width of the house. Strangely, it holds no computer. Computers belong in the \"computer room\" (a smaller room at the back of the house). Epstein has been known to say. The office features a gilded desk (which Epstein tells people belonged to banker J. P. Morgan). 18th-century black lacquered Portuguese cabinets. and a nine-foot ebony Steinway \"D\" grand. On the desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de Sade's The Misfortunes of Virtue was recently spotted. Covering the floor, Epstein has explained, \"is the largest Persian rug you'll ever see in a private home-so big, it must have come from a mosque.\" Amid such splendor, much of which reflects the work of the French decorator Alberto Pinto, who has worked for Jacques Chirac and the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, there is one particularly startling oddity: a stuffed black poodle, standing atop the grand piano. \"No decorator would ever tell you to do that,\" Epstein brags to visitors. \"But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog.\" People can't help but feel it's Epstein's way of saying that he always has the last word.\nIn addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling in New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named \"Zorro.\" \"It makes the town house look like a shack,\" Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, a 70-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being renovated by Edward Tuttle, a designer of the Amanresorts. There is also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on which Epstein recently flew President Clinton, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman's grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few others, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS and economic development in Africa.\nEpstein is charming, but he doesn't let the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely and calculating, giving some hint at the steady whir of machinery running behind them. \"Let's play chess,\" he said to me, after refusing to give an interview for this article. \"You be white. You get the first move.\" It was an appropriate metaphor for a man who seems to feel he can win no matter what the advantage of the other side. His advantage is that no one really seems to know him or his history completely or what his arsenal actually consists of. He has carefully engineered it so that he remains one of the few truly baffling mysteries among New York's moneyed world. People know snippets, but few know the whole.\n\"He's very enigmatic,\" says Rosa Monckton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in the U.K. and a close friend since the early 1980s. \"You think you know him and then you peel off another ring of the onion skin and there's something else extraordinary underneath. He never reveals his hand.... He's a classic iceberg. What you see is not what you get.\"\nEven acquaintances sense a curious dichotomy: Yes, he lives like a \"modern maharaja,\" as Leah Kleman, one of his art dealers, puts it. Yet he is fastidiously, almost obsessively private-he lists himself in the phone book under a pseudonym. He rarely attends society gatherings or weddings or funerals; he considers eating in restaurants like \"eating on the subway\"-i.e., something he'd never do. There are many women in his life, mostly young, but there is no one of them to whom he has been able to commit. He describes his most public companion of the last decade, Ghislaine Maxwell, 41, the daughter of the late, disgraced media baron Robert Maxwell, as simply his \"best friend.\" He says she is not on his payroll, but she seems to organize much of his life-recently she was making telephone inquiries to find a California-based yoga instructor for him.\n(Epstein is still close to his two other long-term girlfriends, Paula Heil Fisher, a former associate of his at the brokerage firm Bear Stearns and now an opera producer, and Eva Andersson Dubin, a doctor and onetime model. He tells people that when a relationship is over the girlfriend \"moves up, not down,\" to friendship status.)\nSome of the businessmen who dine with him at his home-they include newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman, banker Louis Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, real-estate tycoon Leon Black, former Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels), and real-estate\n302 VANITY FAIR 07/26/17 Page 32 of 151 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 MARCH 2003 DOJ-OGR-00032071",
