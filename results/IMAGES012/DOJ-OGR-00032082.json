His department disseminated \"a distorted view of the case\" and behaved in a \"childish\" manner when the grand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges, it sought, another Epstein lawyer complained.\nTo hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the sheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce.\nReiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, Jill, last year, after 24 years of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go to mediation Wednesday. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is particularly ugly.\nReiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney.\nSee REITER, 7B\n07/26/17\nPage 43 of 151\nPublic Records Request No.: 17-295\nDOJ-OGR-00032082",
