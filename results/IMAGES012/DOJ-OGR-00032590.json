The Police Report and Probable Cause Affidavits detail information purportedly obtained by Detective Recarey from Juan Alessi, a former Epstein house manager. The statement was recorded by a stenographer. A comparison of the transcript and the Police Report and Probable Cause Affidavits reveal significant differences. Detective Recarey reports that \"Alessi stated that towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger\". (Police Report at 57). Alessi actually stated that for the most part the masseuses did not appear young. (Transcript at 9). Alessi further declared that only \"one\" girl was young and in his judgment she looked \"16 or 17\". (Id.).\n\nDetective Recarey also notes (Police Report at 57) that Alessi claimed \"the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage\". This statement is directly contradicted by other witness statements, which are devoid of any accusation by any woman that any activity ever occurred on the bed. Indeed, Alessi himself actually stated that on a \"few\" occasions the bed was unmade after a massage, suggesting Epstein may have taken a nap. (Transcript at 11-12). Alessi further explained that even in the absence of a massage he could be called upon to make Epstein's bed three or four times a day, (id), thus providing an innocent explanation for the frequent bed making. It was in fact Detective Recarey who suggested that \"something else occurred\", and even then, Alessi insisted he did not know of \"something else\": \"... or something else, I cannot [say]\". (Id.).\n\nThere is also no mention of Alessi's burglary of the Epstein residence; his theft of cash and possible theft of a gun; or of Alessi's suicidal ideations, all of which made him an unreliable witness.\n\n07/26/17 Page 2277 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032590",
