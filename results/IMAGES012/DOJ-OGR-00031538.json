Because your co-counsel refused to provide copies of the documents and photographs used in his direct examination of  yesterday to the State Attorney or me, which is the professional and customary thing to do, and the fact that he refused to even allow the court reporter to mark the documents as exhibits I am quite fearful we may never see the exhibits again.\n\nTherefore I am compelled to write this letter to confirm that you have agreed that you will provide the State Attorney and me copies of all the exhibits, properly identified, that were used during the direct examination.\n\nVery truly yours,\nTHEODORE J.
