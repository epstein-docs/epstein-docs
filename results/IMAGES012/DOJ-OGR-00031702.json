Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was soooooooooo cool! There was 400 bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I donated a football and a Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to. Bye! 4:18 PM - 0 Comments - 0 Kudos - Add Comment Tuesday, November 15, 2005 BUMMER MAN Current mood: crushed Category: School, College, Greek I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for n Jan. 5. I'm packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal with it. 5:02 PM - 1 Comments - 2 Kudos - Add Comment http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendID=20425696&Myto... 12/21/2005 Page 85 of 104 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 07/26/17 DOJ-OGR-00031702",
