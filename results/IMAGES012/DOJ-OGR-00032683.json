Cause he, he cares a lot about me and stuff, and I stopped working but then I lied to, I lied to Will a couple times and I worked, but then Will found out. And that's when, like he, he broke up with me, and then that once he broke up with me that was what I needed to really snap me into reality and quit. But there was like a few, like a, like I'd say a three month, like three and a half months like during that time, DETECTIVE: This year? Well this year was only like, maybe six weeks that I didn't work, but since the New Year, since the beginning of this New Year, from January 1st to like April, in between then was probably six weeks where I didn't work. Um, and then I don't remember when my other hiatus was, like I don't really remember but that was towards like the beginning. DETECTIVE: What, what did you do with all the money that you made? Do I have to tell you? Cause I don't think it's any of your business [laughs]. DETECTIVE: Okay, you don't have to. I'm sorry. I'm not like involved in drugs or anything like that, but, I really just don't wanna tell you. DETECTIVE: That's fine. Cause I don't have anything to show for any of it. I spent it all. I spent it all. DETECTIVE 2: Okay, okay. I get paid, I spend my money too. //[laughs] DETECTIVE 2: So I mean it happens, right? Yeah. As a matter of fact, I just told you on, on the New Year I was in New York on his dime. So, yeah. DETECTIVE: Were you there on his plane? No, not on his plane. He was using his plane, I think he had to do something. He has, owns an island in the Caribbean, you guys all know that, I'm sure. But um, I think he was flying to his island",
