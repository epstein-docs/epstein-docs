He's shopping around \"Killer Grandpa,\" his investigation into a lynching that his grandfather led in 1935. \"My grandfather was a sheriff in Fort Lauderdale, and he lynched a black man that allegedly raped a white woman,\" James told us. \"About 100 people gathered to watch, and they passed a gun around and everyone took a shot at the body. It became this big town secret, and I write about what really happened.\" Everyone in Alig's inner circle, is played by Seth Green in \"Party Monster,\" the movie adaptation of \"Disco Bloodbath.\" But James said he was \"shocked\" when he watched a few scenes of Green mincing it up with Macaulay Culkin, who plays Alig. \"I didn't know I was so gay! I thought I was more like Steve McQueen, but Seth is flouncing around the whole time. Seth is much cuter than me, actually, and looks better in drag.\" Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction or distribution is prohibited without permission.
