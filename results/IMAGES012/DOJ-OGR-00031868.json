  "full_text": "Probable Cause Affidavit\nPalm Beach Police Department\nAgency ORI# FLO 500600\n\nWe explained the ongoing investigation and asked to speak with [redacted] as we had information that she had \"worked\" for Jeff. Mrs. [redacted] introduced us to her husband and allowed us entry into the home. We sat in the dining room and met with [redacted] Date of Birth [redacted]. As she was under the age of eighteen, Mrs. [redacted] was advised we would be speaking with her. She expressed if her daughter had information, she wanted to assist. We interviewed [redacted] who denied having any inappropriate encounters with Jeff (Epstein). She stated she had gone to Jeff's House with Haley Robson approximately eight months ago, and sat in the kitchen with the house chef, but nothing happened. As the parents were present during the interview, we felt that [redacted] was withholding information from us. She made several comments as to putting the entire incident behind her. I left my telephone number and advised should she wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. [redacted] for her time and left the area. She stated she would ask [redacted] again after we left as to what happened at Epstein's house. I informed her that [redacted] had my telephone number and hopefully she would call.\n\nOn October 4, 2005, Det Dawson and I drove to the [redacted] home and met with [redacted] and [redacted]. During a sworn taped statement, [redacted] stated approximately a year ago, she was taken to house by Haley Robson. She was told she could make money working for Jeff. She was told she would have to provide a massage to Jeff. [redacted] stated upon her arrival to the house she was brought to the kitchen area by Robson. They met with the house chef who was already in the kitchen area. [redacted] stated Haley Robson would wait for her in the kitchen.\n\n[redacted] was introduced to Sarah, Jeff's assistant, who brought her upstairs to the master bedroom. Sarah prepared the room and massage table for a massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and she provided a massage [redacted] stated she kept her clothes on during the massage.\n\nShe advised sometime during the massage, Epstein grabbed her buttocks and pulled her close to him. [redacted] said she was uncomfortable by the incident involving Jeff. At the conclusion of the massage, she was paid $200.00 for the massage. I asked [redacted] if she has any formal training in massages to which she replied no. I asked her if Robson received any monies for taking her to perform the massage.\n\n[redacted] stated Robson also received money for taking her there but was unsure in the amount of monies Robson received for bringing her to Epstein. [redacted] stated she returned to Epstein's house on another occasion with Robson and another girl. [redacted] stated she waited in the kitchen with Robson, while [redacted] was taken upstairs by Sarah. [redacted] stated she only did the massage once as she was uncomfortable with the whole experience.\n\nThe foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed before me this 23 day of November, 2005 by Det Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.\n\nState of Florida\nCounty of Palm Beach\n\nSignature/Arresting Officer\n\nDate: 11/23/2005\n\nSignature of Police Officer (F.S.S. 117.10)\n\n07/26/17 Page 2 of 7\nPublic Records Request No.: 17-295\nDOJ-OGR-00031868",
