  "full_text": "Investor facing felony sex charge\nBy WILLIAM KELLY\nDaily News Staff Writer\nThursday, July 27, 2006\nA billionaire investor and part-time Palm Beach resident has been indicted on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution after police say he had sex with underage girls whom he paid for massage sessions at his El Brillo Way home.\nA Palm Beach County grand jury found that Jeffrey E. Epstein, 53, \"did solicit, induce, entice or procure\" prostitution with girls, who were between 14 and 16 years old, on at least three occasions between Aug. 1, 2004, and Oct. 31, 2005.\nEpstein surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail Sunday and was released on a $3,000 bond. His attorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third-degree felony indictment is based on false accusations and that Epstein wasn't aware the girls were minors.\nThe next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date will be set, but an arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Upon conviction, a third-degree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.\nA resident of New York, Epstein has owned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot waterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since 1990.\nThe indictment followed an 11-month sexual battery investigation that began in March 2005 after a woman told police that her 14-year-old stepdaughter may have been molested by a man in Palm Beach.\nThe investigation also focused on Epstein's assistant, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York City, and on Haley Robson, 20, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by Epstein to help facilitate the massages and sex. Robson found and transported the girls to Epstein's house for the massages in an upstairs bedroom, police said. Neither Kellen nor Robson has been indicted or arrested on any charge.\nPolice took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses concerning the massages and alleged unlawful sexual activity.\nDuring their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone numbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according to police. Epstein would then pay the girls $200 or $300, police said.\n07/26/17 Page 66 of 151 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032105",
