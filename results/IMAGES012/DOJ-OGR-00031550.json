  "full_text": "assertion in the Motion For Protective Order that Mr. Leopold and the undersigned agreed that Mr. Leopold would accept service on behalf of Jane Doe No. 1, and that the undersigned had agreed not to take the disposition on February 6, 2008, the matter has been rendered moot. 3. Prior to filing of a Motion For Protective Order, Mr. Leopold and the undersigned conferred and agreed in writing with the consent of the State Attorney's Office to the taking of Jane Doe No.1's deposition on February 20, 2008. The parties have also agreed that Mr. Leopold will accept service for Jane Doe's No. 1's appearance on that date eliminating the need to use a process server to serve Jane Doe No.1. See Exhibit \"A\" attached. (Jane Doe No. 1's real name has been redacted from the exhibit.) WHEREFORE, given the fact that the parties have agreed to a procedure for the taking of Jane Doe's No.1's deposition, it is respectfully requested that this Court deny Jane Doe No.1's Motion for Protective Order as moot. I HEREBY CERTIFY that a copy of the foregoing has been furnished by mail to Lanna Belohlavek, Esquire, The Office of the State Attorney, 401 North Dixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida 33401, Theodore J.
