Ms Bean identified herself as Victoria Bean and resides in Wellington, Florida. She advised approximately a year ago she was brought to Epstein's house to provide a massage for money. Bean stated she needed to make money and felt it was a quick way to make some money. Bean stated she was brought to the house by Harrison and was introduced to Epstein and his assistant. She was brought to his main bathroom and provided a massage. I asked her if she provided the massage naked. Bean stated she did. She rubbed Epstein's legs, back and chest. I asked Bean if Epstein touched her during the massage. She advised he did not, however he did masturbate as she rubbed his chest. Once he climaxed the massage was over. She was paid her money and left the area. Bean advised it occurred one time and she never returned to Epstein's house. The interview was concluded and Bean was escorted to the lobby. I located a telephone number for Courtney Wild and attempted to contact her on several occasions. I called 561-856-2617 and spoke with Ms. Wild who advised she would speak with me in Deerfield Beach where she resides. Due to a scheduling conflict, we were unable to meet. I informed her I would contact her to schedule another appointment to speak with her about this investigation. I have attempted to meet with her and make telephone contact with negative results. On February 13, 2006, I met with David Rodgers at 7318 Heathley Drive in Lake Worth. Rodgers was identified as Epstein's pilot. I spoke with Rodgers who advised he has been employed with Epstein since 1991. He flies both planes for Epstein depending where he wants to fly to. Rodgers was asked about passengers in the plane he flies. Rodgers stated unless Epstein flew to his island off of St. Thomas, there would be no way of knowing who the passengers were. I mentioned a recent flight to Ohio, where Rodgers flew to pick up Dana Burns. Rodgers stated he recalled flying on several occasions and did remember Burns. Rodgers stated once he is in the cockpit, he does not know who the passengers are. When he prepares the passenger manifests, he lists Epstein and his assistants he knows by name, Sarah and Adrianna. Rodgers stated he would list either female or male passengers on the manifests only to keep a count on the passengers. Mrs. Rodgers came into the living room and recommended that her husband consult with an attorney. Mr. Rodgers agreed he would speak with the family attorney to inform him of this questioning. I explained to Mr. Rodgers that he was not the suspect in this investigation and ceased all questions. Based on the fact Rodgers could not advise who passengers were in the plane, I then left the area. I attempted to locate Britany Beale at 8358 Xanthus Lane in Wellington. I left my business card for her to return my call. On February 14, 2006, at 12:06 pm, I received a call back from Ms. Beale 07/26/17 Page 2604 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032917",
