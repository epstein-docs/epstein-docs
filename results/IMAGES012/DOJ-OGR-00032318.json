I collected mail correspondences addressed to Jeffrey Epstein as well as notepaper (Important Message) with names and telephone numbers. The following are items collected from Epstein s trash. Joanne G. (714-0546) blank piece of white paper (561-881-8118) black paper (655-7626) black paper (917-783-4113) David (772-546-6952) MSN Hotmail web page with email address (adrianamucinska@hotmail.com) The following items were documented for Detective Pagan s investigation for evidentiary purposes. On April 06, 08, 11, 12, 13, 15, 2005, at approximately 9:30 a.m, I met with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employees. I observed the employee enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo Way and collect the trash from Epstein s property. I followed the employee to a predetermined area at which time I collected the trash bags from the sanitation truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation department, where I sifted through its contents. All of the documents collected from Epstein s trash during my assistance were turned over to Detective Pagan for evidentiary purposes. On June 14, 2005, Detective Michelle Pagan contacted me and advised that the airplane belonging to Jeffrey Epstein of 358 El Brillo Way was parked at the Palm Beach International Airport. Detective Pagan requested that I begin trash pulls for the purpose of gathering evidence and intelligence. I made contact with Town of Palm Beach Sanitation Office Supervisor Tony Higgins and requested trash pulls for 358 El Brillo Way to begin on June 15, 2005. On June 15, 2005, I met with a sanitation employee. I observed the employee enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo Way and collect the trash from Epstein s property. I followed the employee to a predetermined area at which time I collected the trash bags from the sanitation truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation department, where I sifted through its contents. The trash yielded negative results and no evidence was collected. No further trash was collected throughout the week due to the fact that Epstein s security gates remained closed throughout the week; therefore, the sanitation employees were unable to gain access onto the property for collection of the trash. 07/26/17 Page 2005 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032318",
