Enclosed please find background information on [REDACTED] and her family.\n\nYou will find the enclosed information presents Ms. [REDACTED] as someone who is untruthful, sexually active, smokes marijuana, drinks alcohol, and shoplifts regularly. Additionally, the information reveals the motive behind the false allegations.\n\nBased on Ms. [REDACTED]'s lack of credibility, we request that you reconsider your decision to present this matter to the Grand Jury. In support of this request, it is important to acknowledge that Mr. Epstein does not use drugs or alcohol and has an unequivocal reputation for being truthful; a strict contrast to Ms. [REDACTED]'s reputation.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you after you have had a chance to review this information.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nGuy P.
