Invest. Cont. ************************* NARRATIVE #5 ************************* GREENE Reported By: GUDGER, ELMER C. 10/15/03 Entered By: GREENE, LINDA C. 10/15/03 On Monday, 10/13/03, at 2:00 p.m., Mr. Jeffrey Epstein came into the police department and informed me that earlier today he met with his former houseman Juan Alessi at Green's Pharmacy in Palm Beach. Epstein stated that he presented Alessi with a photograph obtained off the video surveillance system, whereby Alessi admitted to breaking into the house and taking the money. Alessi told Epstein that he broke into the house to take a gun that Epstein usually keeps behind his desk. He could not find the gun so he took the money. Alessi said he and his wife are having problems and they no longer live together. He wanted the gun because he was contemplating suicide. Epstein stated that Alessi has already returned $2,000. of the stolen money and that he will be making arrangements with Alessi to pay off the remaining funds. I asked Epstein if he knew of Alessi's current address or phone number and Epstein said that Alessi was going to call him at 5:00 p.m. today and he would make arrangements for Alessi to come into the police station to be interviewed. Epstein stated he no longer wants to prosecute Alessi but is concerned over the fact that the gun Alessi said he broke into the house to steal is still missing, yet Alessi said he does not have it. ATTN POLICE CLERKS: As Alessi has returned $2,000. to Epstein and arrangements have been made for the return of the rest of the money, please show a full recovery of the $2700. cash. ************************* NARRATIVE #6 ************************* GREENE Reported By: PAGAN, MICHELE D. 10/15/03 Entered By: GREENE, LINDA C. 10/15/03 On Monday, 10/13/03, Det.
