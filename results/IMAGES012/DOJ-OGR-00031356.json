I recognized him and went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I donated a football and a Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to. Bye! 4:18 PM - 0 Comments - 0 Kudos - Add Comment Tuesday, November 15, 2005 BUMMER MAN Current mood: crushed Category: School, College, Greek I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for on Jan. 5. I'm packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal with it. 5:02 PM - 1 Comments - 2 Kudos - Add Comment Monday, November 07, 2005 GGRRRRRR,................!!!!!!! Current mood: pissed off I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me of \"causing losses to their company.\" -Which by the way is bullshit! I was 'by the book' on EVERYTHING!!!!!! I got so red up in that office that I handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN! I already have another job if I want it, and it's so much more money$$$$$. I'm going to be making more money than my old bosses at VS. Success is definately the sweetest revenge.
