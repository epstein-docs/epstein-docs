  "full_text": "Date: 4/20/06 Time: 13:02:26 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 32 Incident Report Program: CMS301L Case No. : 1-05-000368 (Continued) On March 31, 2005, Sgt. Daniel Szarszewski requested that I set up a surveillance vehicle on El Brillo Way and conduct video surveillance of the front exterior of Epstein's residence. At 3:00 p.m., I set up a surveillance vehicle equipped with a video monitoring device. The surveillance vehicle was parked on El Brillo Way approximately fifty feet east of Epstein's driveway. The purpose of the video surveillance was to gather investigative intelligence by monitoring and recording all vehicle and pedestrian traffic entering and leaving Epstein's property. The video surveillance tapes were changed daily with a new Maxell T-160 VHS tape. Video surveillance was established for Epstein's from March 31, 2005 through April 05, 2005. On April 05, 2005, video surveillance was concluded. I reviewed the video tapes and advised Detective Pagan the surveillance videos yielded no evidentiary value. On April 01, 2005 at 9:30 a.m., I responded to the area of 358 El Brillo Way to meet with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employee, Jessie Jones. While parked in the area of 358 El Brillo Way waiting to collect Epstein's trash, I observed a white female, who I recognized as Nada Marcinkova from her Florida driver's license photograph. I made no contact with Marcinkova. While parked in the area, I also observed Epstein's GMC Yukon truck leave the property as well as other vehicles arrive and park across the street from the property. The occupants of these vehicles appeared to be housekeepers, maintenance men, and gardeners. At 9:38 a.m., I met with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employee, Jessie Jones. I observed Jones enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo Way and collect the trash from Epstein's property. I followed Jessie to a predetermined area at which time I collected the trash bags from the sanitation truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation department, where I sifted through its contents. I collected mail correspondences addressed to Jeffrey Epstein, automotive records and personal documents for Janusz Banasiak and Beata Banasiak as well as Jeffrey Epstein notepaper with the names and appointment times for [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. No last names or other personal information was written on the notepaper. While sifting through Epstein's trash, I also collected a three-inch purple finger size object, which had a broken end. The object appeared to be a broken piece from a sexual toy similar to a (Cyclone Vibrator) possibly used for rectal gratification. The sexual object was photographed for Detective Pagan, packaged in a biohazard evidence bag (possible body fluids) and secured as investigative evidence. All items collected from Epstein's trash were turned over to Detective Pagan for evidentiary purposes. On April 05, 2005 at 9:18 a.m., I met with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employee, Jessie Jones. I observed Jones enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo Way and collect the trash from Epstein's property.
