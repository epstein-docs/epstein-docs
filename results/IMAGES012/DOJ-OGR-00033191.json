  "full_text": "Dear Lanna Belohlavek,\n\nI am at a lost f... words, and trying to hold the tears back, after reading about the sickening details of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's case. I have to say in this instance, your office along with the entire judicial system, failed the people miserably, by not adequately punishing a chronic child molester and rapist. This man of wealth and prestige preyed on innocent, poor, GIRLS and systematically raped them at his will. He lived his life and continues to live his life, above the law, and once again has proven the corrupt nature of our system. If this happened to Tyrone from Dade County, he would be facing the death penalty. How can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of girls, receive this joke of a jail sentence, and now be a free man?! How?! Because he is rich? Just the thought of him being in his million dollar mansion, sexually raping these girls makes me sick. Now, I understand the pressure of taking on a powerful person with unlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any conviction is better than none can be appropriate, this was not that time. You did NOT need his cooperation nor did you need to strike a deal. Even without his testimony, and just the victims, your office could have put this monster away for at least 20 years, if not life.\n\nI'm sure you have read Conchitta Sarnoff's piece on the Daily Beast detailing this monsters actions. If your office has not read the piece, you should by all means use it as a cautionary tale on how not to prosecute a rich child abuser and human trafficker. Now, I do not know the side story- your investigation, legal technicalities, how much hush money was paid out, ect ect. But I do know that after people such as Jeffery Epstein have raped the entire country of their retirement savings, he shouldn't be allowed to do the same thing to young children. I do sincerely hope, you, and your office did ALL you legally could have to put this man in prison. However after researching the case, it seems you failed to come down with any authority or justice. I only hope, the Palm Beach DA's office and the US DA can find further evidence, to re try him and put him away for good! It would do our society much good, and set a standard that no one person is above the justice system, especially child molesters. I would hope that as a lawyer, that is suppose to defend the public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that was your little sister or daughter, and do ALL you can to bring this to a full trial with no deals. The American people deserve better, and so do the children that were abused. I hope you understand the anger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you and the whole DA's office need to know this- that monster doesn't deserve freedom!\n\n-A Concerned Patriot\n\np.s. I eagerly await ANY type of response at-\njohngoes15@yahoo.com\n\nPublic Records Request No. 19-372\nDOJ-OGR-00033191",
