Dawson and I met with and her friend at in support. During a sworn taped statement, she explained how everything began. She said she was brought through the kitchen area where she met Sara for the first time. She was led to the master bedroom, Epstein's room. She explained that as she was walking up the stairs she observed several photographs of naked women along the walls and tables of the house. She further explained that she was brought into the bedroom, where Sara prepared the room by setting up the massage table and provided the oils for her to rub on Epstein. She explained she remembered the steam room area, which contained two large showers. Epstein entered the room from the steam room area and introduced himself. Epstein lay on the table and told her to get comfortable. She removed her skirt and kept her shirt on. She could not remember if he was naked or if he entered the room with a towel. Epstein then instructed her to remove her shirt. She removed her shirt and remembered she was not wearing a bra. She stated she provided the massage wearing only her panties. She continued rubbing his legs, thighs and feet. She advised he turned over onto his back. She continued to rub his legs and began to masturbate. Epstein touched her breasts and began to masturbate. Epstein ejaculated which meant the massage was over. At the conclusion of the massage, she was paid $200.00. They walked together downstairs where Sara and were waiting. She stated she received an unknown amount of money for taking her to Epstein. Epstein instructed her to leave her cellular telephone number so that he could contact her when he is in town.
