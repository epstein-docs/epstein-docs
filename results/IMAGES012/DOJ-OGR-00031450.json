Case Narrative: This investigation was initiated on 10/24/05 upon receipt of a call from Stacey Taylor, Co-Manager who stated that an incident occurred on Friday October 21st 2005. involving [REDACTED], CSL came to work at 1:30pm on 10/21/05, dressed in her work attire carrying her purse and a Journeys plastic bag containing what looked like a box of shoes, and then stated that she was going in to return a pair of shoes and she would return for her scheduled shift at 2pm. At approximately 2:45 pm, [REDACTED] was at the store, speaking on the phone and she was wearing a new pair of shoes. She sounded frustrated when she finished with her call; she continued to explain that she had called Journeys customer service line because during her visit to the shoe store two men working there had harassed her and their service towards her was very poor. She had made indirect comments stating that \"stealing was bad\" and that their service towards her was very poor. According to her, after finishing the return, one of the men followed her after leaving the store as she made her way back to work. At approximately 3:10pm, a man came to the front of the store and called out her name. The man never came in the store, but stood directly in front without ever crossing the carpeted area. They talked for a few minutes and he showed her a piece of paper that looked like a receipt. A few minutes later she walked back started, saying that the man who had came in the store was the manager at Journeys; and that he had accused her of stealing the shoes that had returned; claiming that the shoes belonged to someone else. Soon after she came back on the sales floor and a woman in her mid to late 20's came in and requested to speak to [REDACTED] in the front of the store and spoke to the woman, who then became rather upset. It stated that the woman claims she stole her shoes was at the store and the lady was screaming at [REDACTED]. The woman began to explain to Stacey Taylor that a week ago she lost a pair of shoes in the mall (Doc Martin shows for men size 11 1/2), and that she had called the stores she visited that day, including VSS, and was told that no one had found them. She accused [REDACTED] of stealing the shoes and returning them for something suitable for herself, with the original receipt.
