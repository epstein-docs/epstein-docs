Jeffrey Epstein case Comes to turning point. We soon will find out whether big money can buy from the criminal justice system what everyone assumes that big money can buy. The penalty news reports say part-time Palm Beach resident Jeffrey Epstein is expected to face something more than one felony count for solicitation of prostitution. A Palm Beach County grand jury indicted the Manhattan money manager on that charge in July 2006. But a guilty plea that does not recognize the age of the girls whom police say the billionaire paid for sex would be a disservice to the investigators, who pressed the case and, for good measure, a general outrage. Palm Beach police have said that Jeffrey Epstein, 54, paid underage girls, one as young as 14, to come to his 7,200-square-foot waterfront home for \"massage\" sessions. Police said interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses under oath, phone messages, a high school transcript and other items they found in Mr. Epstein's trash and home show that he knew how young the girls were. But after Mr. Epstein's attorneys told prosecutors about the girls' MySpace pages, which mentioned marijuana and alcohol use, State Attorney Barry Krischer sent the case to a grand jury, instead of filing charges himself. Blaming these victims, however, does not make them any more deserving of what happened. And Mr. Krischer's unnecessary handoff to a grand jury, after an 11-month police investigation, more than reinforced Public Records Request No.: 17-295 Please place in Jeffrey Epstein file.
