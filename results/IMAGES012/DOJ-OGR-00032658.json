But then there's another bathroom with a steam shower, and like, I don't know. There's two bathrooms in there, I'll just make it easy. There's two bathrooms. I was brought into the one bathroom, the massage bathroom with the steam shower, and ... was with me, and Sarah was like 'Oh, just wait here, yadda yadda.' So ... and me were waiting on the couch in the bathroom, and, um, Jeffrey comes up and he's like 'Hey, I'm, I'm Jeffrey.' He just introduced himself and, he hands ..., I remember this cause I was pissed off that she got paid to bring me. Like I was pissed off. He hands her a wad of hundred dollar bills and says 'Thank you' and she says 'I'll wait for you downstairs' and I was like 'All right, I'll see you in a little while.'

And he's like, 'Come on, you're not showing' - he talked me into it basically, he's like 'Oh, you're not showing anything,' or did something, I don't even know. So I ended up taking off my skirt, and then he goes, well I think he just started touching, you know, the top of me. So and then he asked me\n\nDETECTIVE 2: When you're saying the top of you, you mean your breasts?\n\nYeah. And then he asked me to take off my shirt. So I took off my shirt but I kept my underwear on. And I wouldn't take my underwear off, I told him no. And he still paid me the same amount. And that was that, I went home.\n\nDETECTIVE: Okay.
