The guesthouse section had open doors and no forced entry was made. I made contact with Banasiak, Date of Birth 04-07-1953, Fl DL and informed him of the search warrant for the premises. The members of the Police Department entered the residence and announced we had a search warrant. A safety search was done and members exited the home. I read the search warrant to Banasiak as Mgr Parkinson videotaped the search warrant execution. Several interior decorators were located on the property. I spoke with Mark Zeff, of 515 W 20th Street in New York. Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for Mr. Epstein's homes. He advised he was contacted in March of 2005 to do a complete overhaul on the house. He advised he was on the phone with Mr. Epstein when officers announced the search warrant. Mr. Epstein was then made aware of the search warrant. Mr. Zeff advised, his contact with Epstein is strictly business and he has never witnessed Epstein with any girls except for his assistants, Sara or Nada. I then interviewed Daniel Estes, of 315 East 14th Street in New York. Mr. Estes stated he has worked for Zeff for seven years. He advised he personally worked on the New York and Palm Beach home for Mr. Epstein. He has previously met with Sara and Adriana, Epstein's assistants in New York and in Florida. Estes stated they travel with Epstein everywhere he goes. I interviewed Zara Bailey of 35 Riverside Jersey City, New Jersey. Bailey stated she just arrived from Scotland and has worked with Zeff for only one month. She stated she has never met Epstein and has not seen him. The interview was then concluded. I then spoke with Douglas Schoettle of 243 Riverside Dr in New York City. Schoettle stated he has been Epstein's Architect for seven years. He further stated he deals with Epstein's assistants and speaks with Epstein on the phone. Schoettle stated he mainly speaks with Sara Kellen, Epstein's main assistant, who travels with Epstein. Schoettle stated he only has contact with Epstein when his services are needed. At approximately 10:30 am, I was informed that the videotaping was concluded. I entered the residence and located two covert (hidden) cameras. The first camera was a covert wall clock in the garage area. I traced the wire behind the clock and removed the RCA wire and unplugged the camera. The other covert camera was located within a desk clock beside Epstein's desk. I traced the wire behind the clock and unplugged the RCA wire. I could not locate another camera. I then began with the search of the residence for the specified evidence. My search consisted of the second floor. Det. Kraul and I began in the master bedroom area where several items were located.
