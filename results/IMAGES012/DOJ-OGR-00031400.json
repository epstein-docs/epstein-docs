  "full_text": "Please place this letter in the Jeffrey Epstein file\n\nTHE PALM BEACH POST\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 25, 2006\n11A\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nEpstein ought to shut up, be happy with 'justice'\nI think that Jeffrey Epstein's \"camp\" should be happy that money and power does buy justice in this county (\"Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case,\" Aug. 14).\nThe exception: the Rush Limbaugh case. But that was at a time when Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer was running for reelection and was not sure he would run uncontested. He received thousands of e-mails asking him to press charges against Mr. Limbaugh. It was a good political move to do so.\nThe Epstein camp should stop attacking the victims' reputation in the media. Let's not forget - they are children. A child's reputation is sacred. Also, according to the law, lack of knowledge of the age of the victim is no defense for statutory rape or any sexual crime committed against a child.\nIf his camp feels that Jeffrey Epstein has been libeled, his high-powered attorneys, Jack Goldberger and Alan Dershowitz, can file a libel suit against the appropriate parties. According to the law, the truth is an absolute defense against libel.\nOther than that, the Epstein camp should be silent and content with the justice obtained from the state attorney. Past cases indicate that children's rights, victim's rights and women's rights are meaningless, and often the victim is re-victimized.\nAILEEN JOSEPHS\nWest Palm Beach\n\nLet commissioners visit Westgate, see good works\nI read with interest a recent article in The Palm Beach Post regarding the Westgate Tabernacle in West Palm Beach (\"Church helps homeless fulfill college dreams,\" Aug. 18).\nI was unaware of the existence of this church or of the problems it reportedly has had with Palm Beach County over code violations. Out of curiosity, I attended a service one morning. I found it a humbling experience. The work this small church is doing to provide real help to the needy, the homeless and other unfortunate citizens is inspiring.\nRegardless of whatever problems the church has, I urge all the county commissioners to attend at least one service at this church just to see for themselves the good works it is doing. I think the commissioners will be impressed and gain a new understanding of this organization. It should be encouraged and assisted, not impeded.\nMARK L. WINANS\nLake Worth\n\nPension guarantee good, but 401(k) provision not\nWhile I'm glad to see that any company with a pension plan in place now will have to guarantee those benefits, it worries me that companies will be allowed to automatically enroll workers in 401(k) programs (\"President signs bill requiring employers to shore up pensions,\" Aug. 18).\nI don't believe employees should be forced to take part in any program in which they would be gambling their money\n\nParker's off: Lieberman was too close to the GOP\n07/26/17 Kathleen Parker's ploy to...
