That was another Jeffrey Epstein, not the one indicted here on a prostitution solicitation charge. Jeffrey Epstein of Palm Beach has never been charged with postal larceny and theft of U.S. Treasury checks, has never pleaded guilty and has never been on probation. The story also incorrectly said that Epstein was arrested Sunday at his Palm Beach home. He surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail, according to his attorney, Jack Goldberger. Goldberger's name also was misspelled in the article. The story appeared on the front page of the Local section. 07/26/17 Page 6 of 151 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032045",
