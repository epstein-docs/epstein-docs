The time frame was within thirteen minutes apart. It should be noted that Robson s residence was in close proximity to the victim's. The next call occurred at 5:50 pm when the victim telephoned Robson s residence. Several calls were made after the above mentioned calls both incoming and outgoing to Robson. Further analysis showed no telephone calls to either Robson s cellular telephone or Robson's residence were registered prior to February 6, 2005. Additionally, I also conducted an analysis on the telephone calls from 305-710-5165. The subscriber information confirmed that the number is registered to Paul A Lavery from Hialeah, Florida. The address was crossed referenced to the Office of Kiraly and Riley Private Investigators. I researched the web page www.rileykiraly.com which also showed various cases in which they assisted. I also located another web site under www.coralspringssparklandrotary.org in which Mr. Riley attended a Miami Rotary meeting and confirmed Atty. Roy Black is among his clientele. The telephone calls revealed Lavery had telephone contact with , and , either just after I attempted to interview them, or just prior. A background was conducted on Lavery which revealed he holds a current Private Investigator License. A criminal arrest record revealed he had been previously arrested for possession of cocaine and solicitation of prostitution. I also researched the girls using www.myspace.com. This web site is a new social networking service that allows members to create unique personal profiles online in order to find and communicate with old and new friends. The site allows one to establish your own myspace.com page and decorate the page any way one wishes. I found the following people have myspace sites: Haley Robson, , YL, , and MD.
