Recarey directed me to a second detached structure located on the South East corner of the property. This area of this structure was assigned with single letters to identify a particular part of the room. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a powered on Dell Dimension 2350, attached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The screen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with URL address of http://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. The power cord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the cable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU, marked with Serial Number 6WTVN21, was secured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt. I also located several media related items within Room B, which were recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence Custodians. I then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a white in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on. The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software, warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. I removed the power cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdown all other media. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was secured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt. I also located several media related items within Room F, which were recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence Custodians. This concluded my participation in the search of the residence. ************************* NARRATIVE # 28 ************************* Reported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 12/21/05 Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 12/21/05 On December 20, 2005, I contacted ASA Daliah Weiss in an attempt to subpoena the Epstein former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who resides in Miami, had eluded the process servers previously and was not served the investigative subpoena. (A telephone message was left as she is not available during the week of 12/19/2005.) I made contact with State Attorney Inv Theresa Wyatt and requested the same via telephone message. I then researched the victim's cellular telephone subpoena data which had been received from a previous subpoena request. I analyzed the records which depict several calls from Haley Robson. The telephone calls start on February 6, 2005 at 12:49 pm.; the same day which the victim and the victim's father stated the incident occurred at Epstein s house. The first incoming call was from Robson's residence at 561 333-0180. The second incoming call from Robson's 07/26/17 Page 2407 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032720",
