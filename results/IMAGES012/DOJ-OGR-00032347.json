I then accompanied CSEU tech Pavlik while she photographed the exterior of the house. Once this was complete I was assigned to search certain areas of the house with Det. Dawson as part of the search warrant.\nWe began in the garage, searching three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a Harley Davidson motorcycle and adjacent closets in the garage. Nothing of evidentiary value was located.\nWe then searched two closets off the kitchen area on the east side. These can best be described as pantry or storage closets. Nothing of evidentiary value was obtained.\nA small office with adjoining bath was then searched. In the bath area I located a phone message book with recent messages. This item was seized as evidence. Please note this bath and shower area are not used as designed but are storage areas containing a variety of items to include a gun safe in the shower and assorted household items.\nWe then searched a bath area and closet at the base of the main stairs in the foyer. Inside the closet two massage tables were located as well as partial nude female photographs. These items were later seized as evidence. Nothing of evidentiary value was noted in the bathroom.\nWe then searched two bedrooms upstairs on the east side of the residence. Located in the bath room of the south bedroom was penis shaped soap. Located in the bedroom of the northern bedroom was penis and vagina shaped soap as well as an adult sex toy. These items were seized as evidence.\nWe then searched the pool cabana located in the south west corner of the property. Several photographs of nude females were seized as evidence.\nI was then assigned to stand by with a person I believe was Douglas Schoettle. Mr. Schoettle was in the residence at the beginning of the search warrant. He was present during the warrant service and subsequent search. I stood by with him until the search was completed and I departed the residence. I had no conversation with him regarding the reason for our presence.\nRegarding seized evidence, all items were photographed in place and then collected by CSEU personnel.\nThis concludes my involvement in this case.\n07/26/17 Page 2034 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032347",
