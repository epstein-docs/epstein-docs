Um, and definitely wasn't a Friday. So it next Saturday night after that. She set it up, and I picked her up from the her apartment, and we drove to the island and I worked, um, and he paid her three or four hundred dollars to bring me.\n8 DETECTIVE: Okay.\n9 And that was it.\n10 \n12 DETECTIVE: All right. Um, and this was a year and a half ago, correct?\n14 Maybe two, I'm not sure, I didn't really keep track\n16 DETECTIVE: //Okay. How old were you when you first, uh, went over there?\n18 If it was two years ago I was sixteen, if it was a year and a half, I would have been sixteen or seventeen, I don't know.\n21 DETECTIVE: Okay.\n22 \n23 Like, I really don't know.\n24 DETECTIVE: Okay. When you first went to give a massage, um, you were explained that, it was just a massage?\n28 Just a massage.\n30 DETECTIVE: Okay. Did she explain, um, how you would have to be dressed to give a massage?\n33 She said that he wanted cute girls, so I looked cute, did my best, I didn't - I didn't think that it was what it was. I wasn't naïve enough to think that he was gonna pay me two hundred dollars just for nothing, [stutters] I, I don't know, like I don't know what was going through my head. I absolutely don't know. And I - the back of my mind I was thinking, oh, well, it could be legitimate, but I was also thinking, you know, at the same time, is she fucking crazy? Like, this guy's not gonna pay you money for not doing anything, not letting him cop a feel or nothing. You know? So I didn't know what to think, I was like oh, I'll just go and I'll feel it out and if I don't like it, I'll leave. Like, in the middle of it, like I don't care. If he does something that I have a problem with then I'll leave.\nDefense Transcript 07/26/17 Page 2343 October 11, 2005 PBPD & Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032656",
