Um, we went shopping at this like sex place on\n43 Okeechobee [ph], and um we bought a bunch of stuff and then we\n44 just went at it in front of him. And, I don't know. It's not like I\n45 was enjoying it either, like in my mind I'm like 'Oh god, when this\n46 is over, you're getting so much money.'
