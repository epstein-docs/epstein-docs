  "full_text": "Probable Cause Affidavit\nPalm Beach Police Department\nAgency ORI# FLO 500600\n\nEach time the girls were taken over, they were previously told they would have to provide a massage, possibly naked. They were also told that should Epstein require them to do anything extra, and they were not comfortable just to tell him and he would stop. [REDACTED] stated Robson received $200.00 for each girl she brought over to massage Jeffrey Epstein. When I asked which girl appeared to be the youngest, she replied, the victim, as she stated the victim was really young, fifteen years old at the most. [REDACTED] further stated each time she went to the house, she sat in the kitchen and waited with Robson until the massage was over. She further stated that the cook would make lunch or a snack for them as they waited. I asked her if there was anything that caught her attention within the home. [REDACTED] stated there were a lot of naked girls in photographs throughout the house.\n\nOn November 8, 2005, at approximately 2:00pm, I met with [REDACTED] at the Palm Beach Police Department. During a sworn taped statement, [REDACTED] stated she had met Epstein approximately two years ago. She was first approached to work for Jeff Epstein by Haley Robson. Robson approached her about working for Epstein and providing a massage to him for $200.00. Robson had made the arrangements however was unable to take her the day the arrangements were made. Robson had [REDACTED] also attended Royal Palm Beach High School and was familiar with Epstein. [REDACTED] recalled she was brought there and entered through the back kitchen door. She had met with an assistant Sarah and another assistant Adrianna. Sarah brought her upstairs as she observed several photographs of naked females throughout the house. [REDACTED] stated Epstein came in the room, wearing only a towel, and laid on the table. [REDACTED] stated he picked out the oils he wanted her to use and requested she remove her clothing to provide the massage. [REDACTED] stated that for the first massage she provided she did not remove her clothing. [REDACTED] stated she had returned several times after that. Each time she returned it was more than a massage. Epstein would walk into the master bedroom/bathroom area wearing only a towel. He would masturbate as she provided a massage. [REDACTED] stated she was unsure if he climaxed as he masturbated under the towel. Additionally she never looked below his waist. She claimed that Epstein would convince her to remove her clothes. She eventually removed her clothes and stayed in her thong panties. On occasion, Epstein would use a massager/vibrator, which she described as white in color and a large head. Epstein would rub the vibrator/massager on her vagina area as he would masturbate. [REDACTED] stated she had been to house numerous times. [REDACTED] added she has no formal training in providing a massage. [REDACTED] stated she brought two females during her visits to provide massages. [REDACTED] stated she brought a girl named \"[REDACTED]\" and [REDACTED] from Royal Palm Beach High School. [REDACTED] stated she received $200.00 for each girl she brought.\n\nOn November 8, 2005, I met with [REDACTED] at the Palm Beach Police Department.
