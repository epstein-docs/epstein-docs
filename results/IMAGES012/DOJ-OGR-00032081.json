  "full_text": "One power player who doesn't find Epstein to be all that hard to figure is Donald Trump.\n\n\"I've known Jeffrey for 15 years,\" The Donald tells the magazine. \"Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\"\n\nAnother thing Epstein - who's said to pocket at least $75 million a year in fees - and Trump have in common is a taste for extravagant living. Epstein lives in a 45,000-square-foot, eight-story mansion on East 71st Street.\n\nLeslie Wexner, founder and chair of the Limited clothing-store chain, bought the place in 1989 for $15,000. Epstein's mentor and one of his clients, Wexner is rumored to have sold the palatial digs to him for just $1. Epstein quickly spent $10 million to gut the place and completely redo the interior.\n\n\"I don't want to live in another person's house,\" Epstein told New York.\n\nBlind dater\n\nCHRIS Noth wasn't lonely on a recent trip to London. The \"Law & Order\" hunk was set up on a blind date with Rose Keegan, an actress and the daughter of historian Sir John Keegan. The two spent much of the evening at the Century Club, and they were chaperoned by Kyle MacLachlan, who is pals with Noth from their days on the set of \"Sex and the City.\" MacLachlan is in London co-starring in a play with hemp-happy Woody Harrelson.\n\n'Rockets' soars\n\n\"ROCKETS Redglare!\" - a posthumous tribute to the late East Village actor and downtown icon - won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. Directed by Luis Fernandez De La Reguera, it features interviews with Rockets' pals Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Jim Jarmusch, Steve Buscemi and Julian Schnabel. Rockets, the beloved 350-pound former bodyguard of punk legend Sid Vicious who appeared in several of Buscemi's and Jarmusch's movies, died last year after years of drug abuse.\n\nBizarre union\n\nBOB Crane was a sex addict, but his second wife, Pat Crane, didn't care. \"He treated women like the rest of the world treats toilet paper. Who's going to be jealous of toilet paper?\" she told \"20/20\" contributing correspondent Chris Connelly. Despite Crane's penchant for seducing other women and documenting his trysts on film and videotape, Pat insists: \"We had a wonderful sex life. We had a wonderful marriage.\" Crane was bludgeoned to death in 1978 with a camera tripod.\n\nPlot device\n\nGAY writers love PAGE SIX. Everyone's favorite gossip column is prominently featured in the new novel \"The Night We Met,\" a romantically swishy comedy by Rob Byrnes about a guy and his mafioso boyfriend. After making references to this page and The Post throughout the book, Byrnes even attempts to replicate one of our items in the climax. Byrnes' fictional item may lack the flawless prose of a real PAGE SIX scoop, but he does have us outsmarting yet another mendacious mouthpiece.\n\nChange partners\n\nSOCIALITE Samantha Boardman ditched her beau, Conde Nast editorial director James Truman, last year for man-about-town Todd Meister. According to our spies, Boardman ditched Meister after she caught him in flagrante with a 19-year-old coed. But don't feel too bad for her. Women's Wear Daily reports Boardman has a new man - Vanity Fair's Graydon Carter. Truman must not be too pleased. When Boardman dumped him, he needed to recuperate at a Buddhist retreat upstate. Editorial meetings at Conde Nast must be a hoot these days.\n\nWell protected\n\nhttp://pqash.pqarchiver.com/nypost/222493931.html?MAC=90db373aedcb1c36a203f8bd... 11/30/2005 Page 42 of 151 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032081",
