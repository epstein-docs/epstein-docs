This room had all white cabinets with a dark grey and black counter top. We did not find anything in this room. We searched the yellow and blue room that is west next to the pantry room. This room had a very large statue of man with a bow. Taken into evidence from this room were nine photographs in frames of various women. We searched the main entrance foyer that is to the north of the yellow and blue room. This room contained two bamboo chairs and ottomans with cushions. It also contained a round table with numerous books. We searched another blue room that is west of the foyer. This room had a stereo system and book shelves that were from the floor to the ceiling. Taken into evidence from this room were eight photographs in frames of various women and/or Epstein, the owner of the residence. We searched the room to the west of the blue room that has sliding glass doors that lead out to the pool. In this room in a dresser were two DVD's and two VCR tapes. These items were taken into evidence. We searched a 2004 black Chevy Suburban bearing Florida tag X99-EGL, registered to Jeffrey Epstein DOB 01/20/53, which was located on the east side of the driveway facing south. I found a Thrifty rental agreement between the passenger seat and the middle console. The name on the rental agreement was [redacted] from [redacted], Florida [redacted]. The phone number on the rental agreement was (561) [redacted]. The vehicle rented was a white 2005 Chrysler Sebring bearing Florida tag W99-FUN. The vehicle was rented on 9/25/05 at 17:58 hours and was returned on 9/26/05 at 16:52 hours. The last four numbers of the credit card used are 9821. Detective Melnichok found a piece of paper in the middle console that said I used the cash in here to fill up the tank and was signed by Johanna. I searched the 2005 black Cadillac Escalade ESV bearing Florida tag Q29-9GT, registered to Jeffrey Epstein dob 01/20/53, which was located on the west side of the driveway facing south. I did not find anything in this vehicle. All of the items that were taken into evidence were photographed in the place they were located and then turned over to crime scene. *************************NARRATIVE # 21************************* Reported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 11/17/05 Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 11/17/05 07/26/17 Page 2575 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032888",
