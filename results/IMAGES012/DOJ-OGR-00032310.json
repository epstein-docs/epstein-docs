The items collected were placed into evidence. It became evident that some of the recordings were recorded with background noise and some interference. The calls most affected were the control phone calls from the victim to the suspect Haley Robson. I obtained the graphic equalizer and discovered that the calls are able to be legible with the use of the equalizer by lowering the background noise and increasing voice gain. I also learned that a tape was broken during the coping of the tape. I returned the copy of the tape marked Property Number 05-243 to have it recopied to have an original in evidence and a working copy with the file. Upon researching the file, it was discovered that the suspect, Haley Robson's cellular calls were subpoenaed incorrectly. The suspect telephone number was 561-308-0282 and the original request was for 561-908-0282. I requested the information through Cingular Cellular Service from February 2005 through the present. The purpose was to have a record of Robson making calls to victim, Jeffrey Epstein and the frequency of calls. The request was submitted to the State Attorney's Office. Investigation Continues.... *************************NARRATIVE # 6************************* Reported By: KRAUEL, CURTIS D. 10/06/05 Entered By: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 10/06/05 On or about September 23, 2005 at approximately 0915 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo and met with PB Sanitation worker Jeff Williams. Williams had been previously notified to assist in trash pulls at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo, Palm Beach, Florida. I observed Williams enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo and remove several plastic bags of trash and place the contents into the back of an empty sanitation truck. I then followed Williams to a predetermined location and seized the trash from the truck. The trash was transported to the Palm Beach Police Department where I began sifting through its contents. There was a total of 4 white in color plastic bags and each contained documentation and correspondence for 358 El Brillo and Jeffrey Epstein. All documents of evidentiary value were removed and turned over to Det. Recarey for follow-up. On or about September 26, 2005 at approximately 0900 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo and met with PB Sanitation worker Jessie Jones. Jones had been previously notified to assist in trash pulls at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo, Palm Beach, Florida. I observed Jones enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo, where no trash was located within the receptacles. I left the area without incident and notified Det. Recarey to that affect. 07/26/17 Page 1997 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032310",
