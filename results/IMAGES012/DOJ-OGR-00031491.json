I arrived and made contact with the caller/mother of the missing juvenile female. She stated her juvenile daughter left yesterday for school, and had not returned. She told me she had spoken with her daughter around 1900 and she was going to the high school basketball game. Later on that night, some of the juveniles's friends called the mother and informed her they had not seen the juvenile at the game. When the juvenile didn't return this morning, she said she became worried and started to contact some of her daughter's friends. They told her they heard she was handing hanging around with Mr. Byron Elrod in an area known as \"The Cut\" which is located off Old Donaldson and Highway 140. \"The Cut\" is a known drug area in the county. I completed a missing person's checklist and obtained a recent picture of the juvenile. I called Detective Allen and informed her of the situation. The mother did not want a juvenile complaint filed. I issued a case card and asked her to call if she found any more information regarding her daughter. D/S Ballard and I left the residence and returned to service. After patrolling Old Donaldson Rd and the Crissler Street area, we were unable to locate any additional information as to the whereabouts of the female. Around 1200, I received a telephone call from stating that she had found her daughter, and she was located at Gregory Lane Apartments off Bells Ferry Rd. The mother told me a friend of the family was going to pick the female up, and escort her back to the parents house. I told to call 911 when her daughter returned and a deputy would be sent out to check on the well being of the juvenile. When the juvenile returned Sgt Thompson met with the juvenile and parents at the house. The Juvenile stated she had been drinking and had done some drugs last night, and that she had been scared to call her parents. She then went to a friends house located at Gregory Lane Apartments and spent the night.
