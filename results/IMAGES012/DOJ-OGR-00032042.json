  "full_text": "4B THE PALM BEACH POST TUESDAY, JULY 25, 2006 Indictment: Billionaire solicited 3 times Palm Beach police will report today about their prostitution probe of the money manager. By LARRY KELLER Palm Beach Post Staff Writer Billionaire money manager and Palm Beach part-time resident Jeffrey Epstein solicited or procured prostitutes three or more times between Aug. 1 and Oct. 31 of last year, according to an indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. Epstein, 53, was booked at the Palm Beach County jail at 1:45 a.m. Sunday. He was released on $3,000 bond. Epstein's case is unusual in that suspected prostitution johns are usually charged with a misdemeanor, and even a felony charge is typically made in criminal information - an alternative to an indictment charging a person with the commission of a crime. His attorney, Jack Goldberger, declined to discuss the charge. State attorney's office spokesman Mike Edmondson also had little to say. \"Generally speaking, there is a case that has a number of different aspects to it,\" Edmondson said of a prostitution-related charge being submitted to a grand jury. \"We first became aware of the case months ago by Palm Beach police.\" Prosecutors and police worked together to bring the case to the grand jury, he said. Palm Beach police confirmed that and said the department will release a report today regarding their investigation. Epstein has owned a five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath, 7,234-square-foot home with a pool and a boat dock on the Intracoastal Waterway since 1990, according to property records. A man answering the door there Monday said that Epstein wasn't home. A Cadillac Escalade registered to him was parked in the driveway, which is flanked by two massive gargoyles. Epstein sued Property Appraiser Gary Nikolits in 2001, contending that the assessment of his home exceeded its fair market value. He dismissed his lawsuit in December 2002. A profile of Epstein in Vanity Fair magazine said he owns what are believed to be the largest private homes in Manhattan - 51,000 square feet - and in New Mexico - a 7,500-acre ranch. Those are in addition to his 70-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands and fleet of aircraft. Epstein's friends and admirers, according to the magazine, include prominent businessmen, academics and scientists and famed Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. 1/25/06 larry_keller@pbpost.com 07/26/17 Page 3 of 151 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032042",
