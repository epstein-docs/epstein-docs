I was born in Ft. Lauderdale, Fl on December 30th, 1986. I eventually moved to Cooper City, Fl, 30 miles north of Ft. Lauderdale. In ninth grade I moved to Palm Beach with my grandparents. (I love them.) After graduation (GO CLASS OF 2005!) I moved to It's in northern Fl, near Jacksonville. I just moved to Tallahassee to attend FSU. My major is International Affairs. Class started three weeks ago. I love it! I listen to all types of music. Everything sounds awesome to me.
