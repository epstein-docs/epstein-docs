  "full_text": "Colleagues cite chief's professionalism, integrity REITER from 1B REITER from 1B\nColleagues cite chief's professionalism, integrity\nREITER from 1B\nW S C THE PALM BEACH POST MON\nColleagues cite chief's professionalism, integrity\nNEY's office for two reasons. First, he pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of sexual activity with minors. Second, he slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt language seldom used by one law enforcement official concerning another because of what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case.\nIn a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case \"highly unusual.\" He added, \"I must urge you to consider, if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases.\"\nIn short, Reiter told the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. \"It looks like a departure from professionalism,\" Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said of Reiter's letter.\nFollowing Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether the super-rich, super-connected defendant had violated any federal laws.\nReiter won't discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one word to describe the chief: professional.\n\"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership,\" said Rick Lincoln, chief of the Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 years.\n\"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all consider Mike to be our peer and a man of integrity.\"\nReiter: Town Manager Peter Elwell says the police chief's well worth his $144,000 salary.\nJuno Beach Police Chief H.C. Clark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on countywide law enforcement issues. \"I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen anything but a professional demeanor from him.\"\nReiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol job at the University of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job evaluations.\nPosh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a resident confined to his home with a sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. Another resident thanked Reiter for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have been at fault.\nReiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. And he's no novice at investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the lead detective probing the drug overdose death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was one of the officers who worked the investigation of William Kennedy Smith, who was charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy family compound in Palm Beach.\nReiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University, also has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and management courses at Harvard. He's been active in countywide interagency law enforcement organizations and has a \"top secret\" national security clearance.\n\"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town,\" said Town Manager Peter Elwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes more than $144,000 as the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it.\n\"He's very businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the work,\" Elwell said. \"I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus years.\"\n© larry_keller@pbpost.com\n07/26/17 Page 44 of 151 Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032083",
