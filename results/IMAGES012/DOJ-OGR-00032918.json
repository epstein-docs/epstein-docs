Det Caristo and I responded to 806 Old Dixie Hwy in Lake Park to meet with Brittany Beale. Upon my arrival, I met with Beale in the parking lot directly behind MAACO Auto Painting. She was advised it was there to speak with her about an ongoing investigation that concerned Jeffrey Epstein in Palm Beach. Beale stated she knows Epstein very well and did not want to speak with me about Mr. Epstein. She was very fond of Epstein and did not want to speak with me about anything concerning Jeffrey Epstein. I explained to her that she was seen at the house and I would like to speak with her. She stated she knew there was an investigation and that I had spoken with other people and therefore I should know what happened at Epstein's house. Beale ended the conversation and walked back into her boyfriends business, Blanton Automotive. Det Caristo and I left the area and returned to the police station.\n\nInvestigation continues.\n************************************ N A R R A T I V E # 41 ************************************\nReported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 4/10/06\nEntered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 4/10/06\n\nA Grand Jury Session was requested during the month of February 2006, in which all the girls that had been interviewed would have been called to testify before the Grand Jury to seek an indictment against Jeffrey Epstein. Due to subsequent meetings with the State Attorney's Office and Defense Attorney Alan Dershowitz the Grand Jury was postponed until a later time. Dershowitz had provided a package of material on the main victims in this case in which they appear on myspace.com and speak about alcohol use and some marijuana use. The State Attorney's Office wanted time to review the material.\n\nI requested additional subpoenas from the State Attorney's Office in which I requested information from Dollar Rent a Car and Jet Aviation. The information requested from Dollar Rent a Car was for the rented vehicle by Alfredo Rodriguez while under the employ of Epstein for one of the victims.
