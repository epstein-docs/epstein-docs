Also in the room, was the dresser /armoire where we located a bottle of peach flavored Joy Jelly (Sexual Lubricant). Additionally, there were several photographs of young naked teenage girls within the closet, which was consistent with what the witnesses said. The massage table was also located within the master bedroom. Video tapes were located beside the television, which were also collected. An itemized list of the property and locations was prepared on the property receipts. At approximately 2:55 pm, the house was secured; the exit of the residence was videotaped. Upon our exit of the property, I encountered Atty. Guy Fronstein who advised he was representing Mr. Epstein. He provided a business card and provided his assistance with the investigation. Due to Hurricane Wilma, which struck the southeast of South Florida causing massive power outages, the courthouse was closed due to the lack of power. I was previously told that the Chief Judge had extended the filing deadlines due to the hurricane and the Courthouse being closed. On October 27, and 28, 2005 the courthouse was closed and I could not file the search warrant and inventory at the clerk's office. On October 31, 2005, I responded to the courthouse and filed the paperwork along with an order to seal, signed by Judge Johnson, to deny any release of any paperwork on this case.

I designated Evidence Specialist Annette Badger to handle the inventory return, the documentation of the property receipts and the collection and bagging of the evidence at the scene. I further instructed CSI Kim Pavlik, ID # 8807, to accompany us and perform the role of photographing the scene and the items that may be taken into custody by the affiant, Detective Joseph Recarey, ID # 7915. My responsibility was to go through from the reading of the warrant to the final exit from the residence and perform a video recording of the reading of the warrant, the initial walk through of the residence showing the current condition and then finally a walk through of the residence at the time of the police exit.
