Man, the underwear I'm wearing right now, he gave me, like I'd, I'd go over there and there'd be a bag of Victoria's Secret underwear like waiting for me like, talking like fifteen hundred dollars worth of stuff. I got a plane ticket from him once, I got a car, I got Christmas bonuses, I got movie tickets, like he'd buy me movie tickets, like he'd say 'Hey, have you gone to the movies lately?' I'd be like I dunno, no, not really, he goes 'Do you want to go?' He'd give me like eight movie tickets. I got show tickets, I went and saw like David Copperfield I had like VIP like tickets or something like that. Um.\n13 DETECTIVE 2:\n14\nThe car, was that under your name or was it under his name?\n15\nNo, it was under his, like I didn't really care though, he'd let me drive it around as much as I wanted. You know, I, I just got the keys to it. And everything else was his business. He said if I ever got pulled over, just to say that it was his car and whatever, that's it.\n21 DETECTIVE:\n22 Okay. Let's talk about the, um, the time that he forced himself on you. Um, take me through that one.\n23\nWe were really, I think it, it was the - Nadia was in the room. And um.\n27 DETECTIVE:\n28 Was she naked?\n29\nI don't know, probably. Like it was, I don't remember if UI. I don't remember at the time, whether or not she was - it was towards the end of my session or whatever you want to call it, so she was probably either getting dressed or was still naked, I don't really know. She was, I think she was still naked though. Um\n35 DETECTIVE:\n36 Was it normal for her by this time to be upstairs with you?\n37\nIf I went there, if I saw her up there I would not be surprised. I wouldn't get surprised when I saw her in the room. Um, sometimes she would just, like, she liked me. Like, she would hang out with me and we, like I would go to the house and we'd eat breakfast together. Or like hang out by the pool or something, it's not like I just went there and did my thing with her in front of him. I don't know. But um. Sorry, go ahead.\n45 DETECTIVE:\n46 Okay. So, you went upstairs and Nada was getting dressed.\nDefense Transcript 07/26/17 28 Page 2367 October 11, 2005 PBPD & Public Records Request No.: 17-295 DOJ-OGR-00032680",
