At approximately 2:45 pm, she was at the store, speaking on the phone and was wearing a new pair of shoes. She sounded frustrated so when she finished with her call, she continued to explain that she had called Journeys customer service line because during her visit to the shoe store two men working there had harassed her and made indirect comments stating that \"stealing was bad\" and that their service was very poor. According to her, after finishing the return, one of the men followed her after leaving the store as she made her way back to work. At approximately 3:10 pm, a man came to the front of the store and called out a name. The man never came in the store, but stood directly in front without ever crossing the carpeted area. They talked for a few minutes and he showed her a piece of paper that looked like a receipt. A few minutes later she walked back started, saying that the man who had came in the store was the manager at Journeys, and that he had accused her of stealing the shoes she had returned, claiming that the shoes belonged to someone else. Soon after she came back on the sales floor and a woman in her mid 20's came in and requested to speak to who claims she stole her shoes was at the store and the lady was screaming at her. The woman began to explain to Stacey Taylor that a week ago she lost a pair of shoes in the mall (Doc Martin shoes for men size 10-12) and that she had called the stores she visited that day, including VSS, and was told that no one had found them. She accused... of stealing the shoes and returning them for something suitable for herself, with the original receipt.
