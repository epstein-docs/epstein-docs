The victim identified Robson's boss as a white male named \"Jeff who lived in Palm Beach (Later positively identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up). During the beginning of February 2005, the victim explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Jeff's house. The victim stated Robson said that she would pick her up at the victims house on Sunday. The victim was not sure of the exact dates but knew it was a Sunday. According to the victim, Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified as picked her up at her father's house. The victim told her father that they were going shopping. It was later confirmed by the victim's father that Robson picked his daughter up on February 6, 2005. According to the victim's father, Robson drove a pick up truck. Robson drove the victim to Palm Beach. Sometime on the way there, a conversation occurred between Robson and the victim whereas Robson reportedly told the victim that if Jeff asked her (the victim) age, she should say she was eighteen. The victim recalled that Jeff's house was on a dead end street. The victim described Jeff's house as a two story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the driveway. The girls walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. In fact, the victim recalled a male approaching them asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Jeff. The male allowed them to continue walking up to the house. The victim stated the man told them that Jeff was not there but was expected back. He allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. Shortly after, Jeff and a woman, described as white with blond hair entered the kitchen. The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed before me this 23 day of November, 2005 by Det Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.
