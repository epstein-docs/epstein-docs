She told them she was going in the mail to return a pair of shoes and was to return for her scheduled shift at 2pm. At approximately 2:45 pm, Hall was at the store, speaking on the phone and she was wearing a new pair of shoes. She sounded frustrated so when she finished with her call, she continued to explain that she had made indirect comments stating that \"stealing was bad\" and that her service towards her had \"nursed\" her and according to her, after finishing the return, one of the men followed her after leaving the store as she made her way back to work. At approximately 3:10pm, a man came to the front of the store and called out \"a name\" as she never came in the store, but stood directly in front without ever crossing the carpeted area. They talked for a few minutes and he showed her a piece of paper that looked like a receipt. A few moments later she walked back startled, saying that the man who had come in the store was the manager at Journey's, and that he had accused her of stealing the shoes she had returned, claiming that the shoes belonged to someone else. Soon after she came back on the sales floor and a woman in her mid to late 20's came in and requested to speak to Alex. Hall went in the front of the store and became rather upset. The woman who claims she stole her shoes was at the store and the lady was accompanying her. Stacey Taylor stated that a week ago she lost a pair of shoes in the mall (Doc #11 11/23) and that she had called the stores she visited that day, including VSS and was told that no one had found them. She accused of stealing the shoes and returning them for something suitable for herself, with the original receipt.\n07/26/17\nPage 81 of 104\nPublic Records Request No.: 17-295\nDOJ-OGR-00031698",
