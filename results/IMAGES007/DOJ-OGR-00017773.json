MENNINGER: Do you have any basis to believe -- any reason to believe that your cooperation would help with this case, would help you with your civil case, that's one question. 5 The other is do you have any reason -- 6 THE COURT: I'm sorry. I don't think that clarifies -- I think it's unclarifying on two points that Ms. Moe has raised. 9 MS. MENNINGER: Okay. 10 THE COURT: One, cooperating in this case, meaning by testifying or more broadly. And two, since she no longer has a pending civil case, I think she'd probably be left wondering what you're referring to. 14 Can you clarify the question -- I think what you're asking is at any point during your -- at any point in your cooperation with the government -- \"cooperation\" is loaded because it's not like there's a cooperation agreement or something. But for lack of a better term, cooperating with the government with respect to this criminal case, did you ever have an understanding that it might benefit you in what was then a pending civil litigation? 22 Ms. Moe, is that getting at what you're suggesting? 23 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. I just wanted to make sure it was clear for the witness. 25 THE COURT: Okay. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017773",
