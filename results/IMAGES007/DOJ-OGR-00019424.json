Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1068 n.4 (7th Cir. 2009); see Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798 (recognizing that protective orders in criminal cases \"[i]n rare instances . . . might raise issues available for review via a petition for writ of mandamus\").\n\nA writ of mandamus issued under the All Writs Act \"confine[s] the court against which mandamus is sought to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction.\" In re City of N.Y., 607 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotations omitted).
