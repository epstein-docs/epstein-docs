When seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of flight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure her presence in court. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007).\n\n24. Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including offenses involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory presumption arises \"that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . .\" 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E). In such a case, the defendant \"bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.\" United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n25. Where the Government seeks detention based on flight risk, the court must consider: (1) \"the nature and circumstances of the offense charged\"; (2)",
