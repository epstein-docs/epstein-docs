And the judge has never had an evidentiary hearing about the conditions.\nIn its most recent letter, the Government contends that Ms. Maxwell's allegation of abuse by the prison guards is unfounded because the Bureau of Prisons has reviewed a video of the incident and has concluded that there is no abuse. This self-serving proclamation is no substitute for evidence. The prosecutors who filed the letter do not even claim to have watched the video. The Government should produce it for the court and defense to review. The court should conduct a hearing to determine what actually happened. The Government professes to believe women, but only when those women are on their side, despite their inconsistent and self-contradictory statements about old, uncorroborated allegations. When it is Ms. Maxwell who has been abused, the Government wants to believe only the abusers who say they did no such thing and without watching the actual video. It seems like the only rule is to get Ms. Maxwell at all costs. And it seems that a conviction is not even enough for the Government - it wants to go so far as to humiliate Ms. Maxwell with false statements about the cleanliness of her cell.
