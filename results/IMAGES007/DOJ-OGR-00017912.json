Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of grooming in a little more detail. Can you please explain the first stage for the jury. A. So we know from the literature -- literature both with victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children, vulnerable populations. We also know this because there are certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for being sexually abused. Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming for the jury. A. So the second stage involves perpetrators putting themselves in situations where they are likely to have access to children, but also where they're being around children is not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym, certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations where their involvement and relationship and access to children are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to isolate that child, the one that they've selected for victimization, in order to have time alone with the child. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
