Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the government urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by the Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring funds held in and disbursed from financial accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of the Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court and are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and approve disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been appointed by courts to oversee financial matters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same hourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb).\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell's London home will be restrained and monitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the proceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the financial account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court's attention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell's lack of candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful restraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse. As previously stated, despite being questioned by Pretrial Services following a period of solitary confinement, suicide watch, sleep\n\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-00020178",
