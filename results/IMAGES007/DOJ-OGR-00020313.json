Even if the case were tried on the previous indictment on July 12th, carving off any time required for trial preparation is unwarranted and unfair.\n\nA continuance is justified based on the second superseding indictment. The new charges up the ante and double Ms. Maxwell's sentencing exposure. To deny her a continuance undercuts her constitutional right to a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel. A continuance - the need for which is caused solely by the government - is reasonable and necessary in defense of Ms. Maxwell. The denial of a continuance risks a miscarriage of justice.\n\nDespite Its Necessity, A Continuance Further Prejudices Ms. Maxwell\n\nA delay of the July 12th trial - especially one that accommodates counsel's other trial schedules - has a direct and deleterious impact on Ms. Maxwell as a result of her continued detention, the details of which are well known to the Court. In addition to her prolonged detention, she is the victim on ongoing hostile media reporting which impacts the ability to seat fair and impartial jurors.\n\nOn April 26th, Second Circuit will hear oral argument on Ms. Maxwell's bail appeal and may moot any need for a further bail application. Nonetheless, Ms. Maxwell reserves her right to seek a bail hearing depending on the Circuit's decision.",
