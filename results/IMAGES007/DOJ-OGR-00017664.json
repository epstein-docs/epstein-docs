THE COURT: Your theory is everything that she -- when you ask her, \"What did you say on this date to the government,\" she says, \"I don't remember.\" MS. MENNINGER: Her story has changed like a hundred thousand times, and that is exactly what the problem is here, your Honor. THE COURT: Well, here's the problem: There is a way you can get in her story has changed, but what you're doing and what -- I don't know what the limits to this would be. You're asking her very specific questions about multiple instances of reporting, and when she said \"I don't remember what I said in that moment,\" you're then introducing the statements of what she said. MS. MENNINGER: I can say, isn't it true that you said this? That's the other way to phrase it. THE COURT: You could say \"do you recall saying this to the government\"?
