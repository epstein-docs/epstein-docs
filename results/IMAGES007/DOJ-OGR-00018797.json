If there were, for example, a paragraph that said these are some of the facts of what occurred, but not all of them, would your omission theory work to get everything in? MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes. THE COURT: If there is a few discrepancies? MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes. THE COURT: Do you have a case for that proposition? I mean, it's really a factual question whether there is a reasonable inference available from which the jury could conclude that there is an inconsistency by testifying to one thing to inclusion of facts now that were not included previously.
