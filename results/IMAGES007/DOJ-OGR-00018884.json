We have a birth certificate of Ms. Roberts that shows her father's name is Sky Roberts. So the relevance, as I understand it, is that the employment of Mr. Roberts at Mar-a-Lago at the timeframe is relevant, is probative of the family's connection to Mar-a-Lago at the timeframe testified to by Mr. Alessi.\nDo I have the theory of relevance?\nMR. ROHRBACH: That's right, your Honor, as well as the conditional relevance theory that the phone number in Government Exhibit 823 appears in Government Exhibit 52 as Virginia's parents. If that exhibit were to come in, this record would become relevant for that additional reason.\nTHE COURT: What case do you have in mind for the adaptive business record?\nMR. ROHRBACH: We'd be happy to provide the case name and cite after the break. I don't want to butcher the name of the case and leave the Court astray. We'll be happy to provide it to the Court's law clerk, as well. I do have a particular case in mind.\nTHE COURT: You have a case in mind, but you're not\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
