  "full_text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nUnited States Attorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J. Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nAugust 21, 2020\n\nVIA ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\n\nRe:    United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant's letter of August 17, 2020 (the \"Defense Letter\"), requesting that the Court enter an order permitting the defendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the \"Civil Cases\") discovery materials produced by the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other discovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should be denied.1\n\nAs an initial matter, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce, substantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include materials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative methods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more than 165,000 pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense Letter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated civil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated \"Confidential\" thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government's designation is entirely appropriate given that the materials--court orders and applications--have been kept under seal by the issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n1 The Government has drafted this letter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed materials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to seal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Letter repeatedly references, and attaches as exhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if filed publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate letter, under seal, proposing redactions to the Defense Letter and requesting that the attachments to the Defense Letter be filed under seal.\n\nApp.090\nDOJ-OGR-00019549",
