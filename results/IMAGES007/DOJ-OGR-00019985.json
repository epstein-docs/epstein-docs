This is a bail hearing. It is not the place to litigate complex legal questions that we will be presenting to your Honor. It's very soon on the motion schedule, and we thank the court for agreeing to the schedule. But there are a few things that are worth pointing out.\n\n18 We believe there are very significant motions here that will affect whether this indictment survives at all or the shape of this indictment and, given the government's representation that it is not planning to supersede, will affect the shape of the entire case, or any case at all that proceeds before the court at trial, if there is a trial. That is exactly what we submit the court can consider, again, in exercising its discretion as to the weight of the evidence.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00019985",
