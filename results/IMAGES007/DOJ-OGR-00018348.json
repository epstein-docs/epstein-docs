With those photos redacted from the photos, I do conclude the probative value of the photos of the massage room is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice. As indicated, the photos corroborate Jane's description of the massage room and would assist the jury in understanding the, quote, layout, size, location, and composition, end quote, of the space. Causey 748 F.3d at 316. I see little risk of prejudice. The exhibits show features of the massage room to which Jane has testified and the jury has heard because the jury will know the length of time that's passed between Jane's experience as she testified to and the photos. It can determine the photos' probative weight. See Certified Environmental Services, 753 F.3d at 90. The third set of photos that the government seeks to admit, photos 918 and 921, depict several back massagers and a bathroom drawer. The government argues that these photos corroborate Jane's testimony that Epstein used vibrators and back massagers of different sizes in abusing her. The Court will exclude these photos. First, these items are highly moveable, such that a photo taken decades later is not probative of the items that Epstein owned at the time that Jane testified she was abused. Second, the government has not presented any testimony that the massagers in the photos match or are similar to the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018348",
