The level of press coverage spiked again in November 2019 when the British tabloid The Sun ran an advertisement offering a £10,000 bounty for information about Ms. Maxwell's whereabouts and it continued at a heightened level over the next several months.\n\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL MEDIA MENTIONS: 2015-2020\n\nThis graph depicts in stark visual terms the sea change in media attention that upended Ms. Maxwell's life at the time of Epstein's arrest. But it was not only harassment from the press that Ms. Maxwell suddenly encountered at this time. She also faced a deluge of threatening messages on social media in the days immediately following Epstein's arrest and death. (See Ex. Q). The hatred directed towards Ms. Maxwell in these posts is palpable and unsetting. Despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell was not charged—indeed, not even mentioned—in the Epstein indictment, and had not been charged with any crimes, the authors referred to her as a \"crazy, pedophile, pimp, bitch\" and a \"subhuman c*nt,\" and called for her to \"rot in jail.\" These people also encouraged all manner of violent acts",
