The next aircraft was a Gulfstream G2B. After that we had a smaller aircraft, a twin engine, light twin Cessna 421. Then we purchased the Boeing 727. Q. Is that it for that period, '91 to 2004? A. Yes, that's it for that period. Q. On the Gulfstream G2B, what, if any, divider was there between the pilot and the passengers? A. As you walked up the airstairs and made a right to go back to the passenger cabin, you passed through a door that contained a passenger cabin. So that door was always closed from the cockpit or from the flight deck. Q. But during the flights that you piloted on that plane, were you able to observe what the passengers were doing? A. No. Q. And how about on the Boeing, what divider, if any, was there between the pilots and the passengers during flight? A. We had two there. As you walked up the airstairs, if you looked left to the flight deck, the door was closed -- there was a door there that was always closed. And then as you made a right to go back to the forward lounge area, there was another door that you would pass through. So there were literally two doors on that one. Q. Were you able to observe what the passengers were doing on SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018975",
