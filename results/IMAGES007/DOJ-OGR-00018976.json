During your time working as a pilot for Mr. Epstein, what, if any, records did you keep about the flights that you piloted? A. We kept a passenger manifest which we filled out after every flight. And then at the end of the day, we had an aircraft log that we put down flight times that we flew on that particular day. And then I also kept a personal logbook. Q. Walking through each of those, starting with the flight log for the plane, what information went into that log? A. Okay. On the passenger manifest you'd have the date, you would have the trip number, you would have the departure, the destination. We had who the passengers were on there, the flight time, I think we also had the amount of fuel we would purchase on there. And then on the aircraft log, it was really for maintenance procedures. It had about engine times, aircraft landings, APU times, stuff like that. Q. What happened to the passenger manifests that you filled out for Jeffrey Epstein's planes? A. Those -- I had those and turned those over to an attorney of Jeffrey's. Q. One of Jeffrey Epstein's attorneys? A. Yes. Q. Did you keep a copy? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
