In the -- probably the late '90s, possibly 2000. Q. Could you describe that townhouse for us please. A. I believe it was a brown, five stories tall. It had a courtyard in the back of it. It was -- it was a pretty big place, probably. I'm guessing -- well, I'm not guessing. Approximately 6,500 square feet, maybe seven. Q. All of these homes you've described, in what borough were they located? A. Manhattan. Q. Based on your observations of and interactions with Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein, what was your understanding of the nature of their relationship between 1991 and 2004? A. Early on they were romantically involved. And somewhere in between that time period they weren't romantically involved. Q. When Ms. Maxwell was the person to let you know about an upcoming flight on one of Mr. Epstein's planes, how would she contact you to convey that information? A. It could have been by beeper. And then after we got rid of the beepers, it would have been by cell phone. Q. About how far ahead of time did you typically receive notice of an upcoming flight for one of Mr. Epstein's planes? A. It would vary. Usually 24 hours. And it could be even two or three days. Q. To your knowledge, did Mr. Epstein fly exclusively by SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018973",
