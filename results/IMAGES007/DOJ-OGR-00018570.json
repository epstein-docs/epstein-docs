So you didn't take the photographs until after the search began at 6:15 p.m.; right? 2 A. We take, yes, the entry photographs and then we proceed with the search after that. So at 6:15, that would be the 3 labeling of the room, the photographs taken upon initial entry 4 and walk-through, and then we would start the search after 5 that. 6 Q. So fair to say that the photographs you took that were 7 taken and that we saw were taken at night; right? 8 A. I believe it was summertime, so they might have been taken 9 around dusk and then proceeding on through the nighttime hours. 10 Q. And the search did last all the way through the night; 11 right? 12 A. Yes, it did. 13 Q. So, I think many of these photographs we saw were taken 14 with a flash; right? 15 A. Yes, sir. 16 Q. And so that wasn't natural lighting conditions, that's what 17 they looked like with a flash photo taken? 18 A. I believe a flash was used in some circumstances in dimly 19 lit areas and I believe other times it was not because the room 20 was sufficiently lit. 21 Q. I want to ask you about a few specific items that you 22 recovered from the residence. 23 You testified about certain items that were in the 24 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
