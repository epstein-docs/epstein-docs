  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 753 Filed 08/10/22 Page 209 of 264 1650 LC7VMAX7 Carolyn - cross 1 inconsistency. I'm not sure where the disconnect is here on 2 the factual inconsistency where there is specific claim of 3 fondling breasts and buttocks. At the conclusion of the 4 massage, Jeffrey Epstein masturbated himself in C presence, 5 paid C in excess of $200 for this encounter, which is also 6 inconsistent with the testimony, which she's claiming 300, up 7 to 600 an encounter. So it's inconsistent. 8 THE COURT: All right. I'm going to overrule on 39 9 and I think Ms. Comey's points are fully available for cross -- 10 sorry, for redirect on this one. 11 The time frame pace is a little difficult to match up 12 exactly given that there is some -- a little bit of a shift -- 13 well, it's hard to know what time frame this is referring to, 14 but I think in light of the witness's testimony, there's an 15 inference available that paragraph 39 falls within the time 16 frame that she talked about, penetrative acts, and that's not 17 included. So I'll allow 39. 18 Next. 19 MR. PAGLIUCA: The same argument for 45, your Honor. 20 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would just like to clarify 21 that the witness only described one penetrative act on one 22 occasion once. So it cannot be that she's inconsistent if she 23 doesn't mention it in 50 different allegations on 50 different 24 dates. 25 THE COURT: Was that the testimony, that there was SOUTERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
