  "full_text": "6. The Public Interest\n\nPlaintiff argues that the public interest is best served by allowing her claims to proceed.\n(8/27/20 Glassman Ltr., at 5.) Specifically, she contends that the public benefits from civil litigation when that litigation furnishes the public with information on the torts and crimes of a wrongdoer. (Id.) Plaintiff further contends that, as her lawsuit is the only civil case currently being litigated against Maxwell (as any others have been stayed or dismissed), \"the continuation of this last remaining civil avenue can furnish the public with critical information as to defendant Maxwell's well known criminal enterprise, how it was operated and all those involved.\" (Id.) It is a mischaracterization of this action, however, to call it the \"last remaining civil avenue\" for addressing Maxwell's alleged misconduct, as, to the extent other civil litigation against Maxwell has been stayed, it has not been terminated - just as this action, if stayed, would not be ended.\nMoreover, as the Government argues, the public interest is also served by protecting the integrity of criminal proceedings. (See generally 9/4/20 Gov't Ltr.) Should civil discovery proceed, there is a risk that the criminal prosecution could be impaired by the premature disclosure of the testimony of various witnesses or could otherwise be prejudiced. (See id., at 3 (citing Johnson, 2003 WL 21664882, at *2).) On balance, this Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of granting a stay.\n\nAccordingly, taking all of the relevant factors into account, this Court finds that Maxwell has met her burden to show that a stay of this action is warranted.\n\nC. The Case Should Be Stayed in Its Entirety.\n\nThe Co-Executors, Government, and Plaintiff all agree that, should this Court grant Maxwell's request for a stay, the stay should apply to the case in its entirety. Indeed, the Co-Executors take pains to argue that a partial stay as to only Plaintiff's claims against Maxwell",
