I received a letter briefing over the weekend regarding the government's request for a limiting instruction with respect to the next anticipated witness. The witness will testify under the pseudonym Kate.\n\nAs the government has indicated, because Kate was over the age of consent in all relevant jurisdictions at the time that she alleges sexual conduct with Epstein took place, she's not a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment. On this basis the defense moved pretrial to exclude her testimony as irrelevant and prejudicial. I denied that request. I concluded based on the government's proffer that she has relevant testimony that is direct evidence of the Mann Act counts and evidence that is otherwise admissible under 404(b).\n\nTo avoid jury confusion and prejudice, however, I concluded that her testimony should be limited in the description of details of the sexual conduct that does not form a basis of the charged counts and that a limiting instruction was required.\n\nOver the weekend, the government asked for me to include in the limiting instruction a statement that I instructed the parties not to ask about details of the sexual conduct that the witness will testify occurred with Mr. Epstein. In part, the government justifies this request based on the defense's opening statement that calls into question the credibility of witnesses based on their inability\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
