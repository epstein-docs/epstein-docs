Among the bases for the Court's initial order denying bail were its findings that:\n- Ms. Maxwell's lack of \"significant family ties\" in the United States suggested \"that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her\" (Tr. 84);\n- the Court lacked \"a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her\" that would allow it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87);\n- \"[c]ircumstances of her arrest . . . may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government\" (Tr. 85);\n- Ms. Maxwell \"is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens\" (Tr. 83); and\n- the government had proffered that its \"witness testimony will be corroborated by significant contemporaneous documentary evidence\" (Tr. 82).\nThe additional evidence submitted herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have significant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and reasonable bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never attempted to hide from the government; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would be extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government's case against her is not supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at the initial hearing.\nThe evidence submitted herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have reasonably been obtained, assembled, and submitted in the 12 days between Ms. Maxwell's arrest and her initial detention hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether reasonable bail conditions can be set, and it shows that the proposed set of conditions will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance in court.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-00020029",
