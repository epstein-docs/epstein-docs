To the extent Maxwell complains that unsealing filings in a civil case may result in unfair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, such a concern is not an issue that is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Indeed, that very issue has been reviewed by this Court in multiple cases on post-judgment appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 215, 232-34 (2d Cir. 2010) (evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased the venire); United States v. Elfgeeh, 515 F.3d 100, 128-31 (2d Cir. 2008) (evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased trial jurors). Should the Court determine that the jury at Maxwell's trial was biased based on disclosure of material in a civil case, and that such material would not have been unsealed had Judge Nathan permitted modification of the Protective Order, then vacatur of the defendant's conviction - if warranted - will adequately vindicate the defendant's\n\n15\n\nDOJ-OGR-00019358",
