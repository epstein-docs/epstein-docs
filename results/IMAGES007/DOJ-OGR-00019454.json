  "full_text": "5. The Interests of the Court\n\nAs for the interest of the Court, it appears that staying discovery in the civil case could conserve judicial resources. Where a criminal case can potentially streamline the related civil case, this factor supports a stay. Sec. & Exch. Comm'n v. Abraaj Inv. Mgmt. Ltd., No. 19cv3244 (AJN), 2019 WL 6498282, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2019). As observed by the Government, the pending criminal case against Maxwell may resolve issues of fact common to the two actions, and may therefore reduce the number of issues to be decided in subsequent proceedings in this case. (See 9/4/20 Gov't Ltr., at 2.)\n\nFurther, although it should not be the decisive factor, this Court also notes that it has some interest in coordinating discovery, where appropriate, among the many civil cases that have been brought in this District against the Epstein estate, and that none of those other cases are currently going forward. This Court additionally notes that tighter restrictions on discovery may be imposed in the context of a criminal prosecution than in a civil litigation, and that, if this civil case were to move forward, restrictions that have already been placed on Maxwell's access to information in her criminal case could have a limiting effect on this Court's ability to supervise discovery here. (See 9/4/20 Gov't Ltr., at 3-4 (noting that “Maxwell's access to information about the criminal matter is under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, who has entered a protective order and has issued several rulings regarding the scope of discovery that Maxwell is entitled to and the manner in which she may or may not use that information”); see also 8/27/20 Moskowitz Ltr., at 3 (noting that Maxwell had indicated, in her initial disclosures, that, due to the terms of a protective order entered in the criminal case, she would be prohibited from disclosing certain information in the civil case).)\n\nThus, at least to some extent, the Court's interest weighs in favor of a stay.",
