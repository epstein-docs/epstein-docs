In the absence of any evidence that the MDC's protocols interfered with Maxwell's trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well within her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\n\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell's conditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation for trial.  This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused her substantial discretion when denying Maxwell's prior applications for bail or temporary release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell now raises new complaints about conditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the District Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan.  In any event, as was the case with her concerns about nighttime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to support her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from preparing for trial.  There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare assertions of counsel that MDC's water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides inadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflows\n\n20\nDOJ-OGR-00020378",
