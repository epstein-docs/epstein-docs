ROHRBACH: Your Honor, all of those -- those may or may not be lines of cross depending on exactly how the question is phrased, but the government is not objecting to them in advance now. The government's objection is to the specific identification of the particular counsel, which we don't think is relevant. And I'd note that I think this counsel's name was used in cross examination of other witnesses already, so the government is trying to, in part, prevent a suggestion that this lawyer is involved in some kind of broader conspiracy for which there is no evidence. So that's a level of prejudice. THE COURT: You can ask if she represented, you can ask what her counsel's name is, I don't see a relevance, you can ask if your attorney is in the courtroom, a spectacle of pointing him out. MS. STERNHEIM: I don't need to do that, Judge. I'm not trying to make a spectacle of this. I'm just trying to have the record covered. THE COURT: I'll allow that. Counsel, any reason for sealing this? MS. STERNHEIM: I don't think so. MR. ROHRBACH: I don't think that's necessary. We didn't use any names. THE COURT: Okay. Not sealed. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
