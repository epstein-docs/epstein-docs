One\n11  victim's views are expressed in the government's reply\n12  memorandum; one victim has submitted a statement to the\n13  government and asked that the government read it during today's\n14  proceedings; and one victim has asked to be heard directly, and\n15  the government anticipates that she will make a statement at\n16  any time during this proceeding as necessitated by the court.\n17\n18  THE COURT: All right.
