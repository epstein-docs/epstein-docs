And at the time the\n3 registration number was N404CB.\n4 Q. Now, in this row there are just two marks.\n5 A. Yes. That's just a copy -- it's a ditto of what's above\n6 it. And what's above it, you'll see where it turns into\n7 HS125-700 and N404CB.\n8 Q. Now, let's go to the \"from\" and \"to\" columns. Can you walk\n9 us through those, please, for flight number one?\n10 A. Yes, flight number one, we departed Wilmington, Delaware.\n11 And our destination was Teterboro, New Jersey.\n12 Q. So what does \"TEB\" stand for?\n13 A. Teterboro, New Jersey.\n14 Q. How far is Teterboro, New Jersey from Manhattan?\n15 A. It's about 16 miles.\n16 Q. And when you flew into Teterboro, New Jersey, what was your\n17 understanding of where Jeffrey Epstein was staying?\n18 A. When we first started working for him, he lived in an\n19 apartment in Manhattan.\n20 Q. And now let's move over to the remarks procedures,\n21 maneuvers, and endorsements part of this row. Can you tell us\n22 what this means.\n23 A. Yes. Like, for instance, on flight number one, I think it\n24 just says repositioning to Teterboro after closing on the\n25 airplane. This is the first flight that we actually own that\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00018982",
