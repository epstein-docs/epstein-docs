Most of those close to her have received them. They have received death threats. They have been injured in their jobs, in their work opportunities, in their reputations, simply for knowing my client.

The facts of all the steps the court had to go through just to make the public access available to this proceeding is also a reality.\n4\n5 There is a real thing out there having a very significant impact on our client. There are folks who would normally come forward as part of a bail package who your Honor is aware of from the Pretrial Services report who can't now, at least at this point, because of the safety and confidentiality concerns. Since last week our firm alone and my colleagues at Haddon Morgan have been besieged with e-mails and posts, some of them threatening. This is all very real.
