Judge Nathan's Order\n\nOn September 2, 2020, Judge Nathan issued the Order denying Maxwell's motion. (A. 99-103). In that Order, Judge Nathan noted that despite \"fourteen-single spaced pages of heated rhetoric,\" Maxwell had offered \"no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions\" regarding why the criminal discovery materials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil cases. (A. 101). Judge Nathan concluded that absent any \"coherent explanation\" of how the criminal discovery materials related to any argument Maxwell intended to make in civil litigation, Maxwell had \"plainly\" failed to establish good cause to modify the Protective Order. (A. 101). Further, Judge Nathan noted that the basic facts Maxwell sought to introduce in civil litigation were already made public through the Government's letter in opposition to her motion. (A. 101-02). Accordingly, even though Judge Nathan \"remained\" in the dark as to why this information will be relevant\" to the courts adjudicating the civil cases, Judge Nathan expressly permitted Maxwell to inform the tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of the basic factual background regarding the confidential criminal discovery materials at issue. (A. 101-02).\n\nE. Maxwell's Appeal of the Order\n\nOn September 4, 2020, Maxwell filed a notice of appeal from the Order. (A. 121-23).
