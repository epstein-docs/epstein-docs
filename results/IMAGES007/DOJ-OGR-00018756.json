There's no additional record that would lead to exclusion, and so we'll do what we need to do. A hearing, an order, only to prepare further for what's going to happen is likely not necessarily. I don't see any law that supports that. But we'll get the full factual record and you'll brief it. So I would like -- if this witness is going to testify tomorrow, I think the government needs to provide the defense the results of a full factual investigation by 6 p.m. And then, Ms. Menninger, when would you like to brief the issue? MS. MENNINGER: By 9 p.m., your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. By 9 p.m. And then let's say -- Mr. Rohrbach? MR. ROHRBACH: I apologize. By 9 p.m. By midnight. I know that's late for the Court. That would be three hours for each side to write a brief. THE COURT: Okay. MR. ROHRBACH: Thank you, your Honor. Just one other point on this witness, your Honor. We understand that this witness is also a subject of a defense subpoena. And so the government would just like to know whether, in light of the defense's motion to preclude his testimony for this reason, he's still under defense subpoena. THE COURT: I suppose they might want to know the result of that motion first. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018756",
