STERNHEIM: Judge, I would just say that it is not being offered for the truth; it's offered for the fact that she maintained contact with him at a time later than the matters in issue and, therefore, it has relevance.\n2 THE COURT: That's the truth, what you just said.\n3 It's being offered for the truth that she had contact.\n4 MS. STERNHEIM: Well, that part is not hearsay. The content is hearsay. The fact of the contact itself is something else. That's my understanding of it.\n5 THE COURT: Well, okay. She said she emailed with him. If you want to redact the content and show that there were emails, I suppose that's another question. But if you're not -- you want the content, which is consistent with what she testified to.\n6 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I want the dates.\n7 THE COURT: Okay.\n8 MS. STERNHEIM: And that is not hearsay.\n9 THE COURT: All right. So the dates then I would permit -- I'll hear the government's response to this, but with the content redacted.\n10 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I'd like to check the transcript, because I thought she had agreed to the dates. And so --\n11 THE COURT: She did.\n12 MS.
