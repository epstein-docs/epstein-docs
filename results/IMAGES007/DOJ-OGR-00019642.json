In the absence of any explanation of Maxwell's need to use criminal discovery materials to litigate a civil case, Judge Nathan was well within her discretion when determining that Maxwell's arguments “plainly fail to establish good cause.” (A. 101). Judge Nathan's Order falls comfortably within the range of permissible decisions on a motion to modify a protective order, and so she did not abuse her discretion in so ruling.\nthe criminal trial would likely have been subject to deposition. That concern, among others, raised a significant risk that proceeding with the civil matter would adversely affect the ongoing criminal prosecution against Maxwell. Moreover, the interests of judicial economy and the public interest in enforcement of the criminal law were served by a stay in the Doe case because the outcome of the criminal case could resolve disputed issues in the Doe case. Such concerns are not present in Giuffre v. Maxwell.\nDOJ-OGR-00019642",
