So the instruction is, you'll hear testimony from the next witness about interactions that she says she had with the defendant and Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the witness -- I instruct you that because -- sorry. Let me start over. You'll hear testimony from the next witness about interactions that she said she had with the defendant and Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the witness was over the relevant age of consent at the relevant time period, any sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not, quote, illegal sexual activity, end quote, as the government has charged in the indictment. For that reason, I have directed the government not to ask this witness the details of any sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that this witness is not a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment. To the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to the issues before you, you may consider it. However, you may not convict the defendant on the basis of the testimony regarding the sexual conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein, nor may you consider this testimony as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein's or Ms. Maxwell character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the indictment.
