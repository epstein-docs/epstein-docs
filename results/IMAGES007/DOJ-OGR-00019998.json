What is the government's position\n7 with respect to the relevance of the alleged victim statements\n8 in the 3142 analysis?\n9 MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government has not proffered\n10 victim's testimony or information in an effort to support its\n11 motion. To the contrary, the victims have appeared consistent\n12 with their rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act. Of\n13 course, as we noted in our reply brief, it is very important to\n14 the government that the victims receive justice in this case\n15 and that there be a trial so that that could happen. That is\n16 very important to the government, and we respectfully submit\n17 that the court should take that into account. However, again,\n18 the victims' participation in this proceeding is pursuant to\n19 their rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act. It is not\n20 part of the government's presentation in this case.\n21 THE COURT: Okay. So I should not consider it --\n22 should not consider the substance of the statements in the\n23 overall bail analysis.\n24 MS.
