Maxwell has filed two separate appeals challenging two different orders by two different district judges. But Maxwell's consolidation motion makes plain that her goal — in both appeals — is to ask this Court to rule on an entirely different question: the lawfulness of the Government's applications to modify certain protective orders in other judicial proceedings. Maxwell's strategy is procedurally improper, for at least two reasons. First, none of the applications or orders with which Maxwell takes issue are before this Court for review — the civil appeal concerns Judge Preska's unsealing order, and this criminal appeal concerns Judge Nathan's Order denying Maxwell's request to modify the Protective Order. Maxwell's motion to consolidate offers no coherent explanation of the connection between the legality of the Government's prior applications and those two appeals. Indeed, as Judge Nathan found, Maxwell has failed to explain, despite a high volume of \"heated rhetoric,\" how those applications could have any possible impact on Judge Preska's decision to unseal filings in the civil litigation.
