To be clear, would you give that money back if it meant that you weren't abused as a kid?\n2\n3 MS. MENNINGER: Objection. Leading, your Honor.\n4 THE COURT: Sustained.\n5 Q. Jane, in your own words, can you tell the jury what that money meant to you?\n6\n7 A. Sorry.\n8 Q. It's all right. Take your time.\n9 A. I mean, it -- oh, I wish I would have never received that money in the first place because of what happened. You know, when you're seeking some sort of closure, and I guess in, you know, laws in this country, compensation is the only thing you can get to try to move on with your life and for the, you know, pain and abuse and suffering that I received, and all the out-of-pocket money I paid to try to make this go away and to try to fix myself.\n10\n11 MS.
