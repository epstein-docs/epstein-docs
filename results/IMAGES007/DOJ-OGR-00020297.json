The Government does not dispute that the media placed a bounty on Ms. Maxwell or that she was being stalked by them before her arrest.

The Government admits that it knew where she was. It had such confidence that it could arrest her whenever it chose that it orchestrated her arrest to coincide with a press conference replete with incendiary demonstrative aids.
