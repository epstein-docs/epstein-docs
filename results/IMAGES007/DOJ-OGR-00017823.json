And so I think unless it's a leading question, I just want to front that in order to avoid creating an issue there. 5 THE COURT: Yes. Well, lead, and that way I don't have to strike the testimony as not a prior consistent statement. 8 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. If the Court authorizes us to lead, I think we can navigate through this area. 10 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, okay if she leads through this portion? 12 MS. STERNHEIM: I have no problem with that, Judge, but if the witness on his own sua sponte says girls, I will be objecting to that. I cannot rely on what they are going to do or not do in closing. 16 THE COURT: I agree with that. That's why I said -- 17 MS. STERNHEIM: That's fine. 18 THE COURT: -- I will let Ms. Moe lead so I don't have to strike that testimony. I think we are in agreement that if he were to testify that she told her that there were girls, the implication would be underage; that implication wouldn't be a prior consistent statement, and so I wouldn't allow that implication to stay with the jury. 24 MS. STERNHEIM: I understand, and I thank you for that. But the other part would be there was no testimony on SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017823",
