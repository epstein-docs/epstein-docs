Mr. McHugh, I want to ask you now about that 2007 purchase 3 of the helicopter we were looking at before. All right? 4 A. Okay. 5 Q. All right. So if we can pull up Government Exhibit 502. 6 Now, before we look at the exhibit, based on what we 7 saw before, it seemed like there was some money that went into 8 this account held by Ghislaine Maxwell that then went out of 9 that account to the account held by Air Ghislaine, and then a 10 similar amount of money going to Sikorsky to pay for the 11 helicopter. 12 Is that an accurate summary of these exhibits we 13 looked at? 14 A. Quite honestly, I didn't map it, but I'm happy to walk 15 through it. 16 Q. Why don't we take a look at Government Exhibit 2 at page 2. 17 502, sorry, at page 2. We looked at those transactions on June 18 15th and June 18th in the middle of the page; right? 19 A. 15th and 18th, yes. 20 Q. And you see that on the 15th, you said that there was 21 money, it appeared coming in from an account held by or 22 associated with Jeffrey Epstein, $7.4 million coming into this 23 account, which appears to be in the name of Ghislaine Maxwell; 24 correct? 25 A. Yes. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018516",
