And can you just flip through the rest of the pages and tell us if you recognize any of the handwriting in the rest. Just look at them silently and tell me, yes or no, whether you recognize any of the handwriting in the rest of the book? A. No. Q. Now, the portions of handwriting that you do recognize, Mr. Alessi -- A. Yes. Q. -- are those messages that you took using the same process you just described for us? A. Yes, I did. Q. So at the same time that you were taking information from a phone call for Mr. Epstein -- A. Yes. Q. -- you were writing it down simultaneously? A. Right. Q. And was that part of your job for Mr. Epstein? A. Yes, it was. Q. Was that a part of the practice of running Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach residence? A. Yes, it was. Q. Okay.
