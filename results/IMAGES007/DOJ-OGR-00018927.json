What is it?\n4 A. It's a picture of Ghislaine Maxwell.\n5 MS. MOE: Thank you, Ms. Drescher. We can take that down.\n6\n7 Q. Mrs. Hesse, can you tell us, what do you remember about what the house in Palm Beach looked like?\n8 A. It's a big home and I believe it to be white. The hedges are all manicured. And large kitchen with an island. It's a two-story home. I remember the stairwell going up. It was on the water. It was like a pool and a patio area. And a guest home off to the left.\n14 Q. When you worked there, who gave you directions about what to do at the house?\n15 A. Ghislaine Maxwell.\n16 Q. What were your job responsibilities?\n17 A. Basically, if anything was broken in the house, like if the air conditioner didn't work, I would call the AC guy and things like that, just any maintenance. And I was there when the housekeeper was there, I would open the door for her and let her in and stuff.\n21 Q. When you worked for Epstein and Maxwell in Palm Beach, did you receive any instructions about what to do if someone called the house?\n24\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
