  "full_text": "Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page21 of 24\n\ninto Maxwell's unit.4 Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as corroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding described in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the \"MCC\"), not the MDC. (See United States v. Days, 19 Cr. 619 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2021), Sentencing Tr. at 13-16 (describing incidents Tiffany Days experienced while at the MCC, including flooding of sewage, before being transferred to the MDC)). There is no evidence in the record from the Days case or this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC during Maxwell's incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any such issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should seek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell's new complaints about her ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge Nathan.5\n\n4 Although Maxwell complains that she has been \"in solitary confinement\" (Mot. at 3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general population. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general population. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that she is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has access to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during which she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a telephone, a television, and a shower. (See Dkt. 196 at 2).\n\n5 As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC have gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources",
