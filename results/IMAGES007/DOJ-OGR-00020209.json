Doc. 274. The government filed a response in opposition [Doc. 282] and Mr. Robertson filed a reply [Doc. 284].\nThe United States Probation Office (USPO) also filed two memorandums addressing Mr. Robertson's release. Docs. 277 and 287. The Court then discussed the motion at length with the parties and the USPO at the February 4, 2021 pretrial conference in this case. Doc. 297 at 4–6.\nAfter carefully considering the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, his history and characteristics, and the potential danger to the community posed by his release, the Court found that a combination of extremely strict conditions could reasonably assure Mr. Robertson's appearance in court and the safety of the community, as required by 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f). Id. The Court also found that Mr. Robertson's release was necessary to allow him to effectively prepare for his upcoming trial under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i) because the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly hampered his ability to meet or communicate with his attorneys. Id. The Court accordingly ordered Mr. Robertson to be released under strict conditions to La Pasada Halfway House on February 5, 2021. See Docs. 300 and 301.\nDOJ-OGR-0000209",
