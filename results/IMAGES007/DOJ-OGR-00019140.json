I think my thinking is if the government rests today or tomorrow, which sounds like what we anticipate, I'll use the remainder of tomorrow, one, to hear the defense motions; and two, for me to work on the charge on my own, having already received your drafts.\n\nAnd then I'll send it to you at some point in advance of a charging conference, which we'll do next week. And again, I'm open to you telling me whether you want to do it in the evenings after testimony or on Saturday. I think really the analysis there depends on what the defense now anticipates as the length of its case.\n\nSo are you in a position to give any additional estimate as to that?\n\nMR. PAGLIUCA: We don't, your Honor.\n\nI think we're hoping to take this evening and tomorrow to put those pieces together, and then provide the Court and the government with that analysis.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. Ms. Sternheim.\n\nMS. STERNHEIM: May I just say, I think it is our thinking at the moment that if we are going to be using the trial days, that our preference would be to Saturday for a charge conference. It seems that it would just be a more focused time.\n\nTHE COURT: I think really the only reason not to do SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00019140",
