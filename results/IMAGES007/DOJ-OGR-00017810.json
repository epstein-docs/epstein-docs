Just to be clear, nowhere in this application did you say you weren't having any difficulties at home, right? 3 A. No. 4 Q. Were you having difficulties at home during this time? 5 A. Absolutely, yes. 6 Q. You were asked some questions about the recommendation letters in your applications to Interlochen. Do you remember those questions? 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. And you were asked about whether your recommenders talked about your family in a favorable light. Do you remember those questions? 9 A. Yes. 10 Q. The people who you asked to recommend you for Interlochen, did they know what was going on in your house at home? 11 A. No. 12 Q. Why was that? 13 A. Because we were very good at hiding what was going on at home, and these recommendation letters are basically just from our school teachers. 14 Q. I want to ask you one last question about this application. If you could turn back to the first page of Defendant's Exhibit J-3. And I want to focus your attention at the top section with applicant information. You see a few lines down, there's SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017810",
