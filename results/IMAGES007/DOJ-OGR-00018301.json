But there is no way for the videos or the photographs we saw to show that they were there any day prior to October 20th, 2005; isn't that right? 2 A. I just don't know how to answer that. 3 Q. Okay. 4 A. That's one of the best questions I've had in 55 years. If I do find out, I'll let you know. 5 Q. Then I'll ask a few more hopefully smart questions. 6 The same thing with the artwork that we saw in the videos and the photographs.

But it would have no way of showing what artwork was there on any day prior to October 20th, 2005? 9 A. I don't see how that would be possible. 10 Q.
