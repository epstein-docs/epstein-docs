But of course that's not what happens. All we do is we offer law enforcement agents who seized these items and can authenticate them, and if defense wants to make arguments to their relevance or otherwise, that goes to their weight and not their admissibility, and those arguments are for the jury. MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, in many criminal cases, there are lots of context over what photographs are admissible and for what purpose. For example, if it was a photograph that was taken inside of a store when there was a robbery that purported to take place in the store, there would be a witness to say that this photograph was taken in or near the events and that we have reason to believe that nothing inside the store has changed. Just showing photographs that are undated, they may be from 1975 for all I know, and showed the two of them together and there is no one to say that it hasn't been altered in the meantime, even the low bar of showing that the photograph is a photograph and without a witness to say it is what it purported to be, I don't think that that is true with respect to what is admissible for a photograph. It's a low bar, but there is not even a single person that can say that this photograph or the ones behind it are what they purport to be. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
