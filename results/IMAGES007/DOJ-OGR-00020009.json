After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n10   Ms. Maxwell retreated from view.  She moved to New England,\n11   changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\n12   made anonymous transactions both big and small.  The defense\n13   said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\n14   but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n15   scrutiny.  Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\n16   from the press and public,  an assumption that the court does\n17   not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n18   conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n19   detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n20   acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n21   Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n22   electronic monitoring and home security guards would be\n23   insufficient.  Were she to flee, the defendant could simply\n24   remove the monitoring bracelet and, as other courts have\n25   observed, home detention with electronic monitoring does not\n26   prevent flight.
