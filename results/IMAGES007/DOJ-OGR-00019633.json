Court for Dist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004). This Court has made clear that it \"issue[s] a writ of mandamus only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion.\" In re City of N.Y., 607 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2010).\n\n\"Pretrial discovery orders . . . generally are not reviewable on direct appeal, and we have expressed reluctance to circumvent this salutary rule by use of mandamus.\" In re S.E.C. ex rel.
