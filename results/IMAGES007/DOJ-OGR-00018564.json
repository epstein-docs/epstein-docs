All right, so I've just handed you what's been marked for identification as Government Exhibit 54. Special Agent Maguire, do you recognize this? A. Yes, ma'am, I do. Q. What is Government Exhibit 54? A. This is a hard drive that was located in the previous exhibit, 935R. This was in one of the boxes that was located in the plastic bins in that office. Q. And have you examined Government Exhibit 54 in preparation for your testimony today? A. Yes, I have. Q. And how do you know that Government Exhibit 54 is one of the hard drives contained in the box that we're looking at here in Government Exhibit 935R? A. I examined this hard drive. I also recognized the New York CART lab bar code that's located on it. Q. So you just mentioned a New York CART bar code. Can you please explain to the jury what that is? A. Typically, when we seize digital evidence items, we then turn them over to a unit in the FBI called CART. It's the Computer Analysis Response Team. They're just more technically trained to extract and review the digital evidence. When they receive an evidence item, they put their own bar code on it. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
