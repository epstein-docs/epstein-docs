Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and training, how, if at all, common is it for a child to be sexually abused multiple times by the same perpetrator? A. Unfortunately, it's very common. Again, because it's occurring in a relationship, oftentimes the perpetrator has continued access and the abuse continues. Q. How long does it typically take to move through the stages of grooming that you've described for the jury? A. It can really depend. I mean, we call them stages, but sometimes they occur simultaneously, sometimes they occur, you know, more gradually. So we can be talking about a process of weeks, we can be talking about something that's happening over the course of months or abuse that can continue over the course of many years. Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you familiar with the term \"grooming the environment\"? A. I am. Q. What is grooming the environment? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
