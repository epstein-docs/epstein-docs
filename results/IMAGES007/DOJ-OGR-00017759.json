At this point what they've articulated is that they want the exact figure that was disbursed, which this witness has already testified to and -- THE COURT: It's just a document of that agreement. I'm going to overrule this objection. Anything else? MS. MOE: Your Honor, in our view, this sort of opens the door to a lot of legal issues related to the settlement funds that are not proper before the jury. It's cumulative of the testimony about this particular figure and would be confusing about its particular terms. THE COURT: Yes, that's what I just overruled. MS. MOE: Understood, your Honor. THE COURT: Anything else to take up? We'll break for lunch for 45 minutes. Thank you. And, Ms. Menninger, if you're going to pierce attorney-client privilege -- MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. Can we take that up right after lunch in a sidebar? I believe I have grounds. THE COURT: You have to speak into the microphone. It should have been briefed. I think that would be clear, but, yes, I'll meet with you in 40 minutes. You'll confer in advance. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017759",
