COHEN: Of course, your Honor. My point was a\nmore narrow point. My point is that the facts in those cases\nare different from our case in a meaningful way and the court\nwas doing a different evaluation. That was the point I was\nmaking on this case.\nSo in conclusion, we believe this is a compelling case\nfor bail. We believe that the government, which has the burden\nof persuasion that never shifts, has not made a showing as\nrequired, that our client is a risk of flight. When you\nconsider the risk, as Judge Raggi put it, in Sabhnani, the\nactual risk of flight, not fantasy and not speculation, when\nyou consider that the only factors they really point to are\nones that the cases have already addressed, such as\ninternational travel and passports.\nWe also submit that the government has not carried its\nburden of showing there is no condition or combination of\nconditions that secure release.\nSo we would ask the court to grant bail today.
