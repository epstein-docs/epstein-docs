It is possible to have Ms. Maxwell present\n2 and to make public access available on that weekend date. So\n3 you can consider if you'd like to do that or not, given where\n4 we are in the schedule. I'll leave it to counsel to consider\n5 it and confer. Alternatively, I suppose we could talk about\n6 the charging conference on the 16th after we finish with the\n7 jury. Any thoughts?\n8 MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government has no preference\n9 between those two dates and would be available for a December\n10 18th conference. I think the timing would just depend on the\n11 length and pace of the defense case. For example, if the\n12 defense case were to begin on Friday, depending on how long\n13 that defense case were to last, it may be that we might need to\n14 have that conference earlier, but we don't have a sense of the\n15 length of the defense case, and so it's hard for us to gauge\n16 the timing.\n17 MR. EVERDELL: May we confer, your Honor?\n18 THE COURT: You may. Let me ask, does the government\n19 anticipate -- I know it's a little hard to predict, but do you\n20 predict resting potentially by Thursday such that --\n21 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. It just depends on the\n22 length of cross of the remaining witnesses, but I think it is\n23 possible we will be resting on Thursday.\n24 THE COURT: Okay.\n25 MS. MOE: Thursday of this week.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00018855",
