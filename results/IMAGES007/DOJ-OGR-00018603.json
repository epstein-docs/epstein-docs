That would strike me as sort of consistent with being in a courtroom to see the testimony. And I'm not aware of that occurring in this case; we certainly haven't been providing trial witnesses with transcripts of testimony. I'm not aware of any attorney doing that either. I think what we're talking about is a conversation between two siblings in which one sibling shared that her experience in court was unpleasant. THE COURT: Pull up the mic please. MS. MODE: Apologies, your Honor. I think what we're talking about here, your Honor, is a conversation between two siblings in which one sibling said she had an unpleasant experience in court; and that she was shown a document on the stand that was -- I don't know all the details of this conversation, just what's been relayed to me. THE COURT: Can I back up and ask if the government gave any direction in advance about not discussing trial testimony with other witnesses, which I think probably would constitute best practices. MS. MODE: Yes, your Honor. Following Jane's testimony, I spoke with her attorney. I don't want to make a representation that's not accurate. My memory of that conversation is that I told him and reminded him SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018603",
