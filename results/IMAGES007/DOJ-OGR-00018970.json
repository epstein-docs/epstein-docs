EVERDELL: It seems evident to me that what the government wants to get into is the fact of Ms. Maxwell's father's death around that time. Because I think what they're going to try to do is argue that his death was somehow a motive for her because of their wealth or something connected to her father, and she had to move to a smaller apartment. 10 Now, this is something that is outside of the scope of the conspiracy and wasn't even -- our understanding, it wasn't even her apartment on 59th; she shared a room with somebody. 13 This is really getting totally outside the scope. It is three years before the conspiracy allegedly began and it is totally out of bounds here because they are trying to link it up to something that has no relevance to this case. 17 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think that what the witness will say is that -- I think the witness will say that her father died in between those two, that's all I plan to elicit. 20 And then she moved to a much smaller apartment. She then moved to a series of larger apartments, ending in a large townhouse. 22 There's evidence that Jeffrey Epstein bought that townhouse for her. This goes to Ms. Maxwell's motive to participate in these crimes with Mr. Epstein in terms of the finances that she received and the fact that she was not a particularly wealthy SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
