And I also would like to say with respect to 309, we litigated whether or not we could put in evidence photographs of this witness, and the government called us, I think it was slut shaming when I tried to argue that there were other photographs of this individual that were much like this that she had put out in newspapers, and now they want to put on a photo of her after she's gotten off the stand and not afforded us the opportunity to cross examine her about similar photographs that she has put out. MS. MODE: Your Honor, I'm surprised by all three of those arguments. THE COURT: Let's start with 332. Is the government's representation that the individual depicted in this photo is a minor at the time of the photo? MS. MODE: Your Honor, we made no representations about the metadata of the file of this photo. To be short, in direct, I don't know. There will be testimony at this trial and there has been testimony at this trial that this person was victimized as a minor. In terms of the particular date of this photograph, we're limited by the information we have in the metadata. I believe it's for this reason that the defense had noticed perhaps a metadata expert and the defense will be free to explore that issue. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
