PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, should I sit or stand?\n3 THE COURT: I don't mind. I just want to hear you.\n4 MR. PAGLIUCA: C4 was the state complaint, your Honor.\n5 And I'm not sure what the objection was.\n6 MS. COMEY: The objection was that it is not inconsistent with the witness's testimony, your Honor.
