To be clear, this appeal has nothing to do with the merits of the government's allegations against Ms. Maxwell, and it will not delay the criminal trial.\n\n5 As for Ms. Maxwell's alternative request that this Court exercise mandamus jurisdiction, the government's brief denies that Judge Nathan abused her discretion but doesn't otherwise contend that this Court may exercise mandamus jurisdiction.
