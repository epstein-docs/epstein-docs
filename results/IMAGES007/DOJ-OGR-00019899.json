The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than Adequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell's Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk and prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government has not carried its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. We respectfully submit that the proposed bail package represents the \"least restrictive\" set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms. Maxwell's presence in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell's siblings, relatives and friends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her despite the unrelenting media attacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered as a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an extremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is also to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.\n\nThe package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering all passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell, for personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release.\n\nUnder the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial Services.16\n\n16 In United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2019), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under which a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed security guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant \"is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a condition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.\" Id. (emphasis in original).
