Ms. Meder, you were mentioning some initials that you saw on the black binders. Could you tell us what you saw? MS. MENNINGER: Objection. It's hearsay, your Honor. The labels on the binders are hearsay. MS. COMEY: I'm just asking her about the initials that were elicited during cross examination. MS. MENNINGER: I did not elicit the hearsay, your Honor. I elicited that there were initials and not what they were, because she just testified she does not know whether those initials are accurate. THE COURT: Sustained. BY MS. COMEY: Q. You also mentioned that you saw dates on CDs. Could you tell us what dates you remember seeing on the CDs you reviewed? MS. MENNINGER: Same objection, your Honor. THE COURT: Sustained. MS. COMEY: No further questions. THE COURT: Thank you. Nothing further, correct, Ms. Menninger? MS. MENNINGER: Not for this witness. Thank you. THE COURT: Ms. Meder, you may step down. You are excused.
