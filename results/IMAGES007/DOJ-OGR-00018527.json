MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank you. 4 5 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, defense has one matter. 6 The next witness I believe is Kelly Maguire, who is going to go 7 and introduce the exhibits, the 900 series exhibits among other 8 things that we've already discussed. There are two photographs 9 in there, and we did discuss these, so I wasn't -- did not get 10 a chance to preview this for the government yet, but there are 11 two photographs, I believe it's 919 and 920, that show the 12 outfits, the schoolgirl outfits. 13 Now, the Court ruled before that those wouldn't be put 14 before the jury unless witness 3, or Kate, was able to link 15 them up. She did talk about wearing a schoolgirl outfit. 16 However, she was not shown those photographs in her direct. So 17 I think we have a similar problem to what we had with Kate -- 18 sorry. With Jane where she described a schoolgirl outfit, but 19 she didn't look at the actual photos that they want to 20 introduce and say those look like the schoolgirl outfits I was 21 wearing on the day I described. 22 So, at this point, because I don't think there is a 23 proper foundation for the same reasons as we had with Jane, I 24 would object to those photos being admitted. 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
