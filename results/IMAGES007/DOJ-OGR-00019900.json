She is not relying on them in connection with this bail application in an effort to safeguard their privacy and protect them and their families from harm.\n\nThe proposed bail conditions are consistent with those approved by courts in this Circuit in other high-profile cases, and should be approved here.

Supp. 3d 24, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (alleged leader of Genovese crime family who was charged with racketeering and extortion granted release subject to conditions), aff'd, 749 F.
