And I think we've agreed that before those topics are raised at a break or before the jury comes out, we're going to confer with the witness's counsel just to confirm what issues might be identifying as to those two particular issues. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to resolve any disagreement there, but we want to just work that out before that comes out before the jury. And I think there are one or two issues that we've agreed that won't be raised without a sidebar in advance to discuss them. THE COURT: Okay. Is there no way to do that now while we're waiting for our jurors or -- MS. MODE: Your Honor, I think defense counsel's preference was to do that at a sidebar. THE COURT: It's here. MS. MODE: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: I just meant I'm happy to do it at the sidebar, to the extent we're referencing the specific identifying information. I just meant as a time saver can we do it now. MS. MENNINGER: I think there are two of the three that we can do now; but the third one depends on what the witness says, your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. Let me just get a check on our juror numbers.
