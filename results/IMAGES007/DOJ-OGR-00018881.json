ROHRBACH: I think that's right, your Honor. If 824 could not come in with the content, we probably would not offer 824.\nI would like to just have this conversation with Ms. Gill, as she's been the head of HR for Mar-a-Lago for quite a long time. She's reviewed this particular employment file, which is much larger than this set of records. So I think she may have a great well more to say about these issues and we would like to be able to talk with her.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018881",
