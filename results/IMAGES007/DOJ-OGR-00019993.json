MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you very much.\n4 Your Honor, I want to begin by addressing head on the\n5 notion that the government's presentation in this case is\n6 somehow about spins or about throwing dirt or about the media.\n7 Your Honor, my colleagues and I are appearing today on behalf\n8 of the United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District\n9 of New York. Our presentation of the defendant's conduct is\n10 detailed in an indictment that was returned by a grand jury in\n11 this court. These are the facts. It is not dirt. It is not\n12 spin. That is the evidence and that is what we have proffered\n13 to the court.\n14 And the notion that anyone could read the indictment\n15 that has been returned in this case and now reach the\n16 conclusion that an adult woman, cultivating the traffic of\n17 underage girls, knowing that they will be sexually abused and\n18 exploited by an adult man, and conclude that that is chilling\n19 conduct, that is, on the face of the indictment, your Honor.\n20 Turning to the facts we have proffered to the court\n21 about the defendant's finances, and particularly about the\n22 defendant's conduct in hiding, it appears, your Honor, that it\n23 is undisputed that the defendant was living in hiding and took\n24 those actions. There cannot be any spin or characterization of\n25 this spin. Those are the facts that appear to be undisputed.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00019993",
