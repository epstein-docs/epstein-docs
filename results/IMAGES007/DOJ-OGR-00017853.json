Is there any relationship between the level of donation given and the person writing the letter to the donor? A. Yes. Yup. For example, our vice president of advancement or even our president would handle a higher-end donor that might be capable of donating half a million dollars or more, for example. And we would have major gift officers that would be below that vice president of advancement that would handle folks with capacity to give $100,000, $200,000, something like that. Q. When these letters are written to donors, does Interlochen put them in any sort of file? A. Yes, yup. We keep track of all correspondence with donors. Nowadays, it's all electronic within Salesforce, which is the software we use to track fundraising and donations. Historically, we have hard copy letters, for example. Prior to using Salesforce, we've got manila folders or files that we kept for each donor that includes all of the correspondence over time with that donor. Q. How long are those records kept? A. They are kept forever. Q. And are they kept by Interlochen in the ordinary course of business? A. Yes. MR. ROHRBACH: Ms. Drescher, would you please display SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
