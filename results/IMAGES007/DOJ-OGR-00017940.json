We know that the more they trusted the individual, then, of course, the more they feel betrayed, the more betrayal there's been. And to the extent that there's betrayal in the relationship, then the individuals are really struggling to a much, much greater degree, often trying to understand what happened, how it happened and why, and what its effect is certainly.\nMS. POMERANTZ: Nothing further, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: All right. Thank you.\nWe'll take our mid-morning break, members of the jury, about a 15-minute break. Thank you so much.\n(Jury not present)\nTHE COURT: You may be seated.\nMatters to take up?\nMS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I just wanted to note, the government understood that the Court's opinion excluded Dr. Rocchio's opinion regarding the presence of a third party.\nWe did check the transcript, your Honor. And on page 73, I had asked a question about whether there was anything about what you're testifying about here that says that grooming can only be done for the benefit of the person doing the grooming, to which Dr. Rocchio responded, No, there's not. And then your Honor had asked a series of questions relating to the presence of a third party, what the defense has been referring to as grooming by proxy, which is a different subject matter.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
