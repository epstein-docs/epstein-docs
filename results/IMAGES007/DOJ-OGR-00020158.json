Strauss-Kahn, a French citizen with no ties to the United States, was arrested on a Paris-bound flight at JFK minutes before takeoff and later charged with several counts of sexual assault, including felony charges punishable up to 25 years imprisonment, for sexual assault and attempted rape of a Manhattan hotel housekeeper on the day of his arrest. The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn's DNA on the accuser's uniform.
