And I think you touched on this, but just to be clear, who 3 hires you for forensic work? 4 A. The vast majority of the time I'm hired by an attorney. At 5 other times I might be hired by the state. For example, at one 6 point in my career the state of Rhode Island hired me to 7 perform forensic evaluations on children and adolescents who 8 had become involved with the juvenile justice department. But 9 at this point the vast majority of individuals who hire me are 10 attorneys. 11 Q. And are those attorneys on just the plaintiff's side or can 12 you explain that for the jury. 13 A. Sure. So when I'm working in a criminal arena, I might be 14 hired by the prosecution or I might be hired by the defense. 15 And if I'm working in a civil case, again, I might be hired by 16 the person who's working on behalf of the plaintiff or the 17 person who's working on behalf of the defense. 18 As a forensic psychologist, I'm coming in and 19 providing an independent evaluation. So I'll work for all 20 sides of -- all parties of a case. 21 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what licenses do you hold? 22 A. I hold a psychology license in the states of Rhode Island, 23 Massachusetts, and New York. 24 Q. In your career, for approximately how many years have you 25 treated and assessed patients?
