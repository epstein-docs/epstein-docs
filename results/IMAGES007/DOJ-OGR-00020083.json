The strong possibility that the defendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant's incentive to flee. Second, the defendant's behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her sophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying bail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87). Indeed, the defendant's time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even to the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut herself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home using a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing her assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card under other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones. The Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media frenzy that followed Epstein's death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). However, as the Court already recognized, regardless of the defendant's reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly establishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family and friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already demonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when purchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has indisputably taken all of those steps.
