Mr. Cohen, based on the government's description of both the quantity and quality of\n9    discovery, is that schedule that's been laid out sufficient from your perspective to do everything that you need to do?\n10\n11    MR. COHEN: Your Honor, just two points in that regard. I think counsel for the government did not mention in\n12    the e-mail we had sent to your Honor's law clerk that August 21 would be the deadline for production of search warrant\n13    applications and the subpoena returns. I think she just failed to mention it for the record. That would also be part of the\n14    schedule.\n15\n16    THE COURT: Thank you.\n17    Ms. Moe, do you agree?\n18\n19    MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. I apologize. We did include that in the e-mail to your Honor's chambers, and\n20    that is correct.\n21\n22    And thank you, counsel, for clarifying that.\n23\n24    MR.
