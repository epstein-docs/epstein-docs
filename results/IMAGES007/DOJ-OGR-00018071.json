A. Yes, sir. Q. And so that's different in what you're looking at in Exhibit 52; correct? A. Yes. Q. And as you sit here today, you can't tell us, for example, whether someone took a book from Mr. Epstein's house, took it to Kinko's, had it printed much smaller and shrunk down, took out pages, added pages, did whatever they did to it, and then rebound it. You can't -- you don't know whether that happened or not; correct? A. Correct. Q. You were not charged with -- you were not tasked or directed by anyone to maintain these books in Palm Beach?
