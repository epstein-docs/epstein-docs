So I'll overrule the objection and I'll admit the -- well, you're seeking admission of the full message books with the ones you indicated or just the ones you indicated? MS. MOE: We're just offering the subsets of the marked exhibits that I read into the record. If defense counsel would prefer that the books themselves be admitted along with it, we certainly would have no objection about that. We just tried to be more narrow. THE COURT: I would say part of my analysis depends on having reviewed the full set of books. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. I have no objection to offering Government Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, and I can do that when the jury returns. THE COURT: Okay. Anything else to bring up before the jury comes back? MS. MOE: Nothing from the government, your Honor. THE COURT: We can bring the witness back. Mrs. Hesse, you may take your seat. Thank you. (Continued on next page) SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
