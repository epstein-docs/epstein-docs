And I apologize for 3 asking for a sidebar, but I'm hoping this will streamline 4 things. The issue is at a number of times the witness has 5 testified that she doesn't recall, and instead of showing the 6 witness the document and asking if that refreshes her 7 recollection, which is the only thing that would be proper at 8 that juncture, I believe counsel is now just reading reports 9 into the record, which is not proper. 10 THE COURT: Well, the question was yesterday you 11 testified -- 12 (Pause) 13 THE COURT: So, yes, she said she didn't remember if 14 Epstein directed where they sat. 15 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, under 613, I'm not 16 obligated to show the witness a prior statement before I ask 17 her about it. I have to give her an opportunity -- 18 THE COURT: She said she didn't remember. What's the 19 inconsistency? 20 MS. MENNINGER: Well, your Honor, her not remembering 21 I don't have to refresh her recollection. Her memory is at 22 issue in this case. If she can't remember what she said a 23 month ago or two months ago or a year ago, that's relevant to 24 the jury's determination. Then we can put on evidence through 25 other witnesses that that is in fact what she said to the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017663",
