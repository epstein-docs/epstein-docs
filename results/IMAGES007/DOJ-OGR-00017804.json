Just to be clear, did those trips have anything to do with Maxwell and Epstein? A. No. Q. Without discussing any specifics about your family members, do you have some family members who live abroad? A. Yes, that's -- the country that we would travel to, that's where we were from, and any time those dates that were discussed earlier, that would be a family trip home. Q. Do you recall being asked on cross-examination questions about whether you had ever talked to a reporter? A. Yes. Q.
