THE COURT: All right. 823-R is admitted in its redacted form. (Government's Exhibit 823-R received in evidence) MR. ROHRBACH: Thank you, your Honor. Ms. Drescher, if you would pull up 823-R for the public. And members of the jury, if you would turn to Government Exhibit 823 in your binder. I believe there are two binders, and this is in the larger binder. Again, it's the larger binder of the two binders. THE COURT: Larger binder, GX-823. And we have 823-R published. BY MR. ROHRBACH: Q. Ms. Gill, whose personnel action notice is this? A. This is for Sky Roberts. Q. And what does it reflect about Sky Roberts? Or what -- let me turn your attention, I guess, to the top left corner of this. A. Okay. Q. Would you read for the jury the date of hire. A. Date of hire was April 11th of 2000. Q. Thank you. MR. ROHRBACH: And, your Honor, if I may just ask the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018893",
