We'll see you tomorrow.\n2 (Jury not present)\n3 THE COURT: Everyone may be seated.\n4 Okay. Matters to take up?\n5 MS. MOE: Your Honor, we just wanted to provide the\n6 Court with an update on timing. We anticipate that we may rest\n7 tomorrow or, if things run long, on Friday morning.\n8 THE COURT: Okay. Does the defense anticipate moving\n9 to a defense case after the close of the government's case?\n10 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we do have witnesses. I\n11 think we haven't had the chance to confer with the government\n12 yet, but I think it might make sense, especially if we finish\n13 on Thursday potentially, to have the charge conference on\n14 Friday so we can have time to fully address it.\n15 THE COURT: I'll need you to pull up the mic.\n16 MR. EVERDELL: We will likely have an application at\n17 the end of the government's case, as is typical for the\n18 defense. And we'd want the chance to be heard on that as well.\n19 THE COURT: So my thinking had been the charge\n20 conference either the evening of the 16th or, if the parties\n21 were interested in taking me up on Saturday the 18th. So I\n22 suppose it depends if you're saying there is -- you won't be --\n23 well, I would prefer, given just timing of when I'm going to be\n24 able to get you the charge, to not do it Friday, unless you\n25 don't have a case to put on on Friday.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00019117",
