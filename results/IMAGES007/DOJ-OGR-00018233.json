And you will direct the government -- do you have an extra copy of the binder so I can have it? 3 MR. EVERDELL: We've been relying on the screens for your Honor, but if you like, we can -- well, I don't have one right now but I can probably make one pretty quickly. 4 THE COURT: We'll do the screens. I prefer paper. 5 MR. EVERDELL: There are not that many for this witness, but why don't we give you a paper copy. 6 THE COURT: Fine. 7 Ms. Comey, you confirmed with courthouse staff that when you're showing the video, the screens in the overflow courtrooms will also not show the video, correct? 8 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. We checked and played the video in here, in this courtroom, and checked to see that it will not play in the overflow courtroom, and everything seemed to be working the way we want it to. 9 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. 10 I'll just make sure that, once the video is completed, that the screens are returned so that members of the public can see the published exhibits? 11 MS. COMEY: Absolutely, your Honor. I think that there may be a couple minutes' pause while we turn things back SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018233",
