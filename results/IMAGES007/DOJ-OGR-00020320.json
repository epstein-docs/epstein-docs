  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 03/07/21 Page 3 of 5\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIM\n\nThe Court's request for updates concerning Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement does little to improve her situation. Quite the contrary. The government's update letters are anything but helpful: They fuel media attention which resounds to Ms. Maxwell's detriment. The government's attempt to publicly embarrass and humiliate Ms. Maxwell in the hostile court of public opinion further erodes the likelihood that her case will be tried by a fair and impartial jury.\nThe government's review of the MDC may be Yelp-worthy, but it does not justify Ms. Maxwell's inappropriate detention. If the government wants to compare Ms. Maxwell to other defendants, it should do the right thing and consent to bail.\nIt is debatable whether the public has a \"right to know\" about Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement, but clearly, it does not extend to personal and medical information. The government safeguards personal information regarding its witnesses and is reluctant to release any unless mandated by statute or court order. Yet the government fails to accord Ms. Maxwell the same treatment.\nShould the Court request further updates from the government, we request that they be limited to changed circumstances and filed under seal or subject to appropriate redaction.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM\nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM\ncc: All counsel\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-00020320",
