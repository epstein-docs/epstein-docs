Obviously if the charging conference is Friday, I'll have to get you the charge before Friday, which is possible. It may not be a lot before Friday.\nMR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we're happy to accommodate the Court's schedule on the charge. If you'd prefer to do it Saturday, I just --\nTHE COURT: I don't have a preference. I just wanted to make that available to the parties because it can be difficult, I know, to review the charge as trial is proceeding. So I'm not sure I have a preference. Go ahead.\nMR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we're simply trying not to waste the Friday. But, to be honest, the charge is obviously very important and is going to require some careful review. So we'll defer to the Court on what makes the most sense. But we could do it on Friday if the Court wants to take advantage of the day, but I think it would probably make more sense to do it at a later day and we'll make ourselves available.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
