Your Honor, as the 2 Court will recall, earlier today a witness identified as Kate 3 testified that the defendant asked her to wear a schoolgirl 4 costume. Several schoolgirl outfits were recovered from 5 Jeffrey Epstein's residence in 2019. 6 Here, the fact that they were schoolgirl outfits is 7 obvious from looking at them. They are relevant because they 8 confirm that Epstein's practice was, in fact, to prefer girls 9 dressed as schoolgirls and to have people wear schoolgirl 10 outfits. So it is directly corroborative of Kate's testimony 11 on that score. 12 They're additionally relevant because they confirm an 13 issue, which defense has put it, in dispute in this case, that 14 Jeffrey Epstein did, in fact, have a sexual preference for 15 schoolgirls. That point has been vigorously disputed at trial. 16 These exhibits confirm that that in fact was the case and 17 corroborates the testimony of Kate that she was in fact asked 18 to wear such an outfit. 19 Similarly to the Court's ruling with respect to Jane's 20 testimony and the descriptions of the massage room, here, it's 21 not necessary for a witness to talk about the particular 22 details of a schoolgirl costume. The point is the same, one 23 witness was asked to wear a schoolgirl outfit and Epstein did 24 possess those schoolgirl outfits and had a preference for 25 people dressed that way and, in fact, forced schoolgirls.
