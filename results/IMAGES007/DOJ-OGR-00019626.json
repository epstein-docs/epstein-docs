The rights implicated by the Order—namely, the use of pretrial discovery materials—do not justify expanding the limited collateral order exception, which is “interpreted with the utmost strictness.” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799.\n\nMaxwell relies principally on three cases in seeking to overcome decades of Supreme Court precedent narrowly construing the exception to the requirement that appeals in criminal cases be from the final judgment of conviction.
