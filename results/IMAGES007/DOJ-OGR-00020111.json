(Gov. Mem. at 13). The government ignores that, since the initial bail hearing, Ms. Maxwell's spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submitted a detailed letter describing his committed relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years and the important role she has played, and continues to play,\n\nIt also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell's closest friends and family, many of whom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk, to support her bond with pledges of assets or letters of support. This information, which was not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell's strong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail.\n\nRather than address the merits, the government attempts to dismiss the significance of Ms. Maxwell's relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial Services that she was in the process of getting a divorce and that her spouse did not step forward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing.
