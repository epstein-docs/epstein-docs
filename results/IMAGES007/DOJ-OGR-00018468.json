ROHRBACH: One matter to take up, your Honor,\n2 before the jury comes in.\n3 After conferring with the defense we just wanted to\n4 make sure we fully understood the Court's ruling this morning\n5 about one piece of the testimony related to the New York\n6 search.\n7 The government's understanding of the Court's ruling\n8 is that the government is not going to offer exhibits that\n9 depict either images of celebrities or images of nude or\n10 semi-nude people inside the house; but it is going to elicit\n11 testimony from the witness that she observed those two\n12 categories of images. We just want to make sure that both of\n13 those were consistent with -- both of those pieces of testimony\n14 would be consistent with the Court's ruling.\n15 THE COURT: You can ask the witness testimony about\n16 what she saw at the relevant time period.\n17 On the celebrity piece, I understood you to say you\n18 weren't moving in that exhibit; that is a desk with photos of\n19 Epstein with celebrities. Was that a misunderstanding?\n20 MR. ROHRBACH: No, that is correct, your Honor.\n21 THE COURT: I didn't rule on that, but your question\n22 is may you ask the witness about photos she saw?\n23 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes. So my understanding is we're\n24 going to just ask at a relatively high level of generality, but\n25 both photos she saw and the nude artwork she observed.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
