EVERDELL: Those are for you, your Honor.\n18 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.\n19 MR. EVERDELL: It should be three, for the next three witnesses. Sorry I couldn't get one for your Honor's deputy.\n20\n21 THE COURT: All right. So we can bring the witness back and we can get the jury.\n22\n23 THE WITNESS: Good afternoon, your Honor.\n24 THE COURT: Good afternoon, Mr. Parkinson. You may take your seat.
