COMEY: Your Honor, we consent to the exclusion of the other photograph because we understand your Honor's ruling about the prejudice, especially when taken out of context, but here the probative value is extraordinary when it is taken in context, especially after Mr. Alessi's testimony about the fact that the defendant spent the majority of her nights in this bedroom with Mr. Epstein and the testimony that this is where many of the massages took place that are the subject of the charges here. It is extremely probative of the defendant's knowledge that, in order to walk into that room, you have to go by a sexually suggestive photograph of a young girl.\nWe have no intention of arguing that Mr. Epstein or that the defendant is alleged to have had any sort of sexual involvement with prepubescent minors, and we would consent to an instruction to that effect if that's what the defense would like, but I think the fact that there is a sexualized photograph of a clearly underage female in the entryway to that room is highly probative.\nIt also directly responds to the argument that the defense made in its opening and has been making through cross examination, that Mr. Epstein was some upstanding citizen who was surrounded by presidents and all sorts of important prominent people, and so he never could have possibly been\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
