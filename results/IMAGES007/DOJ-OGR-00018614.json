ROHRBACH: Understood, your Honor.\nIf I could confer with Ms. Pomerantz, she's putting it on; but I suspect it really is unlikely to come out on redirect at all.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\n(Counsel conferred)\nMR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, the government is not planning to talk with Mr. Flatley on direct about CDs. So it's hard to imagine what exactly would happen on cross that would make this an issue; but, of course, the government doesn't want to limit itself by promising under no circumstances will it elicit this information.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nSo if you're not going to ask about CDs on direct, if he's not crossed on CDs, that's the end of the matter.\nMR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Ms. Menninger, does that get us where we need?\nMS. MENNINGER: That's fine, your Honor. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Great. Thank you both.\nAll right.
