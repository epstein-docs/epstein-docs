STERNHEIM: Thank you.\n6 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, may I briefly address\n7 something?\n8 THE COURT: Sure.\n9 MS. MENNINGER: Government Exhibit 761 was offered, it\n10 was a Professional Children's School application for Jane. I\n11 elicited testimony from the offer award that he did not verify\n12 the information pertaining, for example, to the financial\n13 guarantor, and I objected to the admission of that for the same\n14 reasons your Honor is articulating for Lieberman.\n15 THE COURT: So I overruled that objection because,\n16 what seemed to me, the relevance was that the witness or her\n17 family was indicating that Mr. Epstein was providing financial\n18 assistance at the time, whether or not he was providing\n19 financial assistance at the time.\n20 MR. ROHRBACH: I would also note, your Honor, that in\n21 addition to the verification line of business records cases,\n22 there is another line of cases of adoptive business records\n23 which say that if a company receives a record created by an\n24 outsider and integrates it into their files and relies on it,\n25 it becomes a record of that business.
