I remember telling her that I had been raped and molested by my grandfather starting at the age of four. Q. What, if any, conversations did you have with Maxwell about travel? A. I couldn't travel because I couldn't get a passport because I was too young. And my mom, no matter how messed up she was, there was no way I would be able to leave the country. Q.
