  "full_text": "Case 1:17-cr-02949-MV Document 3061 Filed 02/16/21 Page 2 of 16\n\nIn this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court explains its release analysis under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3142. It also explains its decision to deny the government's Amended Emergency Motion for Reconsideration and Stay of Release Order. Doc. 298.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMr. Robertson is charged in a three-count superseding indictment with Obstruction of Justice by Retaliating Against a Witness, Victim, or Informant, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1513(a)(1)(B); Possessing and Discharging a Firearm in Furtherance of a Crime of Violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c); and Felon in Possession of a Firearm and Ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924. Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting an individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September 12, 2017 in retaliation for D.S.'s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier. See Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December 11, 2017 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2021, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention in this case for over three years. He was arrested on December 11, 2017 and was ordered detained the same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the community or his appearance in court. Doc. 12. Extensive pretrial litigation followed until the case was eventually ready and set for trial on March 23, 2020. Doc. 63. The Court held a pretrial conference on March 10, 2020 and testimonial writs were issued. Docs. 127 and 143. Just days later, however, the devastating extent of the global COVID-19 pandemic became clear and the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico suspended all civil and criminal jury trials set for the following month.
