Maxwell, Case No. 20-2413 (2d Cir.), and she is now appealing Judge Nathan's order denying the motion to modify the criminal protective order, United States v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-3061 (2d Cir).\n\n\n\n\nArgument\nThis Court should consolidate the appeal of Judge Preska's order unsealing the deposition material with the appeal of Judge Nathan's order denying the motion to modify the criminal protective order. Consolidation is necessary for a fair and efficient resolution of these appeals.\nFirst, unless this Court consolidates these appeals, it will find itself in the very same position as the two district courts - one panel of this Court will be privy\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-00019295",
