Just to frame the issue, I recognize we've been clarifying the record about time periods. Our view on authentication for this exhibit is this witness is not authenticating it as a document from a particular time period. I recognize we've been asking questions about that. The question before the Court is whether this witness can authenticate this exhibit as a document belonging to Maxwell and Epstein or a document that he recognizes based on his observations of the book. So we just wanted to frame the question in terms of our perspective. THE COURT: That's fine. I didn't ask the question if it was a later book. Ms. Comey did. There was an objection. We thought we were on foundation. That's where we are. I'm now ruling, sustaining that objection, telling the jury to disregard that testimony. Then it's the defense's turn to voir dire, you'll seek admission, I'll rule. I may admit it, I may not admit it, I may reserve until we hear the testimony of employee one. MS. MODE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you. (Continued on next page) SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018067",
