FILED 18/20=4 Page 4 of 4\n\nArticle 3 of the Bilateral Extradition Treaty signed on April 23, 1996 between the United States of America and France stipulates that \"The requested State is not bound to grant the extradition of any of its nationals, but the Executive Power of the United States has the right to do so at its discretion if it deems it appropriate.\"\n\nIn application of this Treaty and of the general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France systematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial authorities, while the American authorities regularly agree to extradite their nationals to France.\n\nIt should be noted that the principle of non-extradition of nationals applies not only to the United States but also to all other States except the Member States of the European Union under the terms of the Law of March 9, 2004 transposing the framework decision of June 13, 2002 on the European arrest warrant, which provides that the surrender of the requested person may not be refused on the sole ground of his French nationality.\n\nThis principle of non-extradition of nationals fits into the context of the construction of the European judicial area which itself is part of a very specific process of political integration between the Member States of the European Union. This high level of political integration existing between the Member States of the European Union goes hand in hand with a certain homogeneity within these States in terms of the scale of penalties as well as in terms of adjustment of penalty methods; the member states being bound by the same international obligations (in particular the obligations arising from the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights).\n\nIn any event, the principle of non-extradition of nationals is a principle of extradition law from which France has never deviated outside the framework of the European Union.\n\nOffice for the International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters\n\nPhilippe JAEGLE\n[signature]\n\nDOJ-OGR-00020102",
