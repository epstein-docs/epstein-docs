We want to confirm that the\n10 defense is not seeking to recall Jane regarding any prior\n11 consistent statements so that she can be released for recall.\n12 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we would like to just\n13 think about it tonight and can certainly let the Court know\n14 tomorrow.\n15 THE COURT: Okay.\n16 MS.
