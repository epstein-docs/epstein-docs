  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cv-00046-LJL-DCF Document 124 Filed 12/24/20 Page 12 of 13 would unduly prejudice their ability to mount their own defense. (See 8/27/20 Moskowitz Ltr., at 1-2.) Where one defendant is a central figure in an action, and where that individual's testimony is of key importance, a partial stay can lead to duplicative discovery efforts. Trustees of Plumbers and Pipefitters Nat. Pension Fund, 886 F. Supp. at 1141. This Court is persuaded that, as Maxwell is a central figure in this civil case, a stay of discovery that applies only to her would prejudice the Co-Executors by requiring them to conduct discovery without having the opportunity to depose Maxwell or collect documents in her possession. (See 8/27/20 Moskowitz Ltr., at 1-2.) Further, a partial stay could lead to duplicative depositions, as, once the partial stay is lifted, Maxwell would be entitled to question any witnesses (including Plaintiff) who may have already been deposed during the pendency of the partial stay, and, once evidence is obtained from Maxwell, other parties might also wish to re-depose witnesses. (See id. at 2.) CONCLUSION For all of the foregoing reasons, Maxwell's motion for a stay of this action, in its entirety, pending the completion of the criminal prosecution against her (Dkt. 69) is granted. If, however, the underlying circumstances change over time in a way that could affect this Court's balancing of the relevant factors, then the parties may bring the changed circumstances to this Court's attention, and it will then consider whether the stay should continue or be lifted. Absent any further application to this Court to review the stay, the parties are directed to provide this Court 12 DOJ-OGR-00019456",
