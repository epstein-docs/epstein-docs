I just wanted to alert the Court that we had run this issue down and disclosed that matter and wanted to promptly alert the Court about that. THE COURT: So Ms. Menninger, the suggestion is we all look at the copy of the notes, I think we resume in about 30 minutes to address the issue. MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. I received it right as testimony was beginning, so I have not studied them. If your Honor would like to take an additional 10 minutes, I can try to do some research, but if your Honor is just wanting to address the content of the note -- THE COURT: My suggestion is we all look at the contents of the notes, do some research, and resume in 30 minutes. How is that? MS. MENNINGER: I will do my best, your Honor. THE COURT: It's all we all can do. Do you want to give a 3500 stamp or -- MS. MOE: Your Honor, I would suggest that we hand up the printed copy now and, during the break, we can stamp it and send an email copy to chambers. THE COURT: That's fine. MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. THE COURT: So it's 12:55. We'll resume in 30 minutes to discuss this. Assuming we're going forward with this witness's testimony, we'll take up, at sidebar, the issue SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018750",
