The question was, is this -- do you know if this is the same book or a later book. I wanted to hear the answer to that. But looking at it, I don't know what his basis for knowledge is for saying that it's the later book. So you can inquire into that or I'll -- yes? 6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, I guess if he left in 2002 and the book is after 2002, I don't think there can be a basis for knowledge. 9 THE COURT: Well, I'll allow the question to be asked. And if there's not, then I will agree with you and I'll strike the testimony. 12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay. 13 MS. COMEY: Understood, your Honor. 14 THE COURT: So that's one. 15 And then two, I just want to make sure I understand, because the letter indicated this witness, sort of a new person to authenticate, as opposed to the original witness who you indicated would authenticate; correct? 19 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. That other witness we believe could also authenticate it, but -- 21 THE COURT: Right. So it seems to me when you're finished here and after the voir dire, I can sustain the objection, overrule the objection, or reserve until I hear additional. Any reason not to do it that way? 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018057",
