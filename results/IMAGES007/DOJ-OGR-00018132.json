She described, in fact, in striking detail what was it was like to be inside the house and what the artwork was like. I'd be happy to read that into the record. THE COURT: I'll take a look at it. We do have all of our jurors. I think I have your argument on this one. We're not going to get to this witness before lunch. I'll take a look at Jane's testimony and the 900 series of exhibits and I'll hear from you further at the break if I need to. MS. MODE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you. MR. EVERDELL: Thank you, your Honor. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, one logistical issue that Ms. Drescher reminded me of. Is there a way to confirm that when we play the video on the jurors' screens that it will not appear in the overflow rooms? My understanding from my conversation is when you play anything on the juror's screens, it automatically shows up on the public screen. I was going to turn off the public screen, but that won't work. THE COURT: We would have to have staffing to turn off all of the screens in the overflow rooms. Is this in the immediate? No, we have Mr. Alessi's cross. MS. COMEY: It's the next witness after Mr. Alessi. THE COURT: So Ms. Williams will check with the AV folks in the interim to see if there is any way to just show -- SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
