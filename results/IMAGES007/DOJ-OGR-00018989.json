In other instances, the last name would need to be redacted. MS. COMEY: So, your Honor, the thinking was that there's phone numbers for not only Carolyn, but also a number of third parties. THE COURT: We could do redactions of the last four, for example. Again, I understand it's labor, but do it now or do it later and, it seems to me, better to do it now. MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. May we have the long weekend coming up as well to complete those redactions please? THE COURT: Yes. MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor. MR. EVERDELL: One other choreography point just for purposes of cross, we do have folders for the jury. I could put it under their chairs now, as long as they are instructed not to look at them. MS. COMEY: No objection. THE COURT: Okay. Have you looked at the in limine instruction? MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, the government has no objection. MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, actually if we could take that up when we return from the lunch break. THE COURT: Okay. That's fine. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018989",
