PAGLIUCA: 5 Q. Mr. Alessi, do you recall in 2020, in this declaration, 6 saying, I was also instructed on one occasion by Mr. Epstein to 7 pick Ms. Jane up from what I presumed was her home address in 8 West Palm Beach, Florida and drive her to Mr. Epstein's home? 9 Do you recall that statement in your under-oath declaration? 10 A. First of all, I would like to know where this declaration 11 was taken place. I think this -- if I remember correctly, this 12 was sent to me by mail. By somebody. I don't recall making 13 this declaration with anybody. 14 Q. Well, Mr. Alessi, we've established that that's your 15 signature on July 9 -- 16 A. Yeah, it is my signature, but I don't recall being in a 17 place and declare this. 18 Q. Okay. Are you denying making the declaration? 19 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think there may be some 20 confusion about terminology here. 21 THE COURT: Yes. 22 I think the question is not, were you deposed, but, 23 did you sign this statement? 24 THE WITNESS: Yes. It definitely is my signature. 25 Q. And is that what you said, you were instructed by SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018163",
