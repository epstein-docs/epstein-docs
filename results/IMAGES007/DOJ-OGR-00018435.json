POMERANTZ: The government is concerned about this line of questioning. She's asking a series of questions about her romantic history. It seems unduly invasive.\n3 THE COURT: Just a moment. We had an earlier sidebar. I permitted her to ask questions based on the declaration regarding someone who said she planted drugs on the person that she's now asking a question about. So, how is the objection consistent with that ruling?\n4 MS. POMERANTZ: I understand that ruling, your Honor -- my understanding is I frankly didn't know that's where it was going, but it's also my concern is that it's been a series of questions that have just been basically a litany of questions --\n5 THE COURT: Counsel, when you have an objection, I rule on it. A series of questions objections doesn't fly. Please bear in mind my rulings, that that is why we do it at the sidebar, that's why the jury had a 45-minute break. I don't need a sidebar every time a question that I've approved is asked.\n6 (Continued on next page)\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00018435",
