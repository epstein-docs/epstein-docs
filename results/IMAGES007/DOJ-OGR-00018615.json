I'm sustaining that objection on\n3 401/403 grounds.\n4 What else do we need?\n5 MS. MENNINGER: Nothing else from the defense, your\n6 Honor.\n7 MS. MOE: Your Honor, may we briefly be heard at\n8 sidebar about an issue relating to potential cross-examination\n9 of Brian that implicates a privacy interest?\n10 THE COURT: Okay. So this will be sealed; correct?\n11 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n12 THE COURT: I do have a request for lengthy sealed\n13 proceedings that we do them in the robing room because of the\n14 physical taxing on the court reporter. So if you think it will\n15 be short, we can do it here; if it will be more than five\n16 minutes, we should do it in the robing room.\n17 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n18 I believe this will be brief.\n19 THE COURT: Okay. All right.\n20 (Pages 1440 to 1443 SEALED)\n21 (Continued on next page)\n22\n23\n24\n25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
