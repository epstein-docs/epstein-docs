I think you testified earlier you had approximately 10\n3 meetings with the government in preparation for your testimony\n4 here; correct?\n5 A. Yes.\n6 Q. And toward the end of those meetings, meaning not the end\n7 of each meeting, but meaning the meetings closest to today, the\n8 issue of your immigration status was raised, wasn't it?\n9 A. Yes.\n10 Q. And a request was made that the government look into\n11 helping you with a U visa?\n12 A. I asked that an inquiry be made.\n13 Q. And at some point, if not today, but at least prior to\n14 today, it was your interest in getting a U visa; correct?\n15 A. Yes.\n16 Q. Because at some point, your other visa will no longer\n17 survive; correct?\n18 A. No.\n19 Q. So the U visa would permit you to stay here; correct?\n20 A. No, I'm saying no to what you said. So that's not the\n21 case.\n22 Q. The exceptional visa just lasts forever?\n23 A. No, but it's renewable and I have existed and I have stayed\n24 here in status on those visas for the period of time that I've\n25 been here. It's not problematic to renew them.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00018455",
