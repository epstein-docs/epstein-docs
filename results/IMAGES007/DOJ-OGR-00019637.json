In her briefing before the District Court, Maxwell offered no coherent explanation of how the criminal discovery materials could have any conceivable impact on the issues pending in civil litigation. She cited no case law suggesting that, for example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery argument by the Government should foreclose unsealing in a civil case, or that unsealing analysis should be affected by a concern about pretrial publicity in a separate criminal case.

As far as the Government is aware, the only issue pending in the civil litigation in which Maxwell seeks to use those criminal discovery materials involves whether the First Amendment requires that certain filings in those cases be made available on the public docket.
