Q. You also mentioned parental factors. Can you explain that for the jury please. A. To the extent that there's conflict and particularly, to the extent that there's violence between the parents in the home, certainly to the extent that there are financial difficulties within the home, so children, families, parents who have less -- fewer resources, are at higher risk. To the extent that the parents themselves have experienced any form of abuse in their own backgrounds, that also places the child at higher risk. To the extent that the parents are abusive to the child, that puts the child at risk for being abused by others. And there's also research to show that the presence of a stepfather in the home or oftentimes a single parent can, under certain circumstances, put a child at higher risk. Q. You also mentioned family factors. Can you explain those please. A. Those factors refer to the family functioning in general. So children who have poor attachment, poor connection with other family members are at higher risk. Families where there are other children in the home who are being abused or have been abused are at higher risk. Families who are isolated, for example, those families that have moved six or more times in SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017929",
