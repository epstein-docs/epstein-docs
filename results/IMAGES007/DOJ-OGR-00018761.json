And had the government not asked those questions, it was not my intent to get into any of the child issues. But I think the jury is left with the impression that because of what Epstein did to her, she's now schizophrenic and has all these schizophrenic concerns about her children, when, for the last 19 years, these children have been repeatedly put in different places as a result of her problems. MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think if Mr. Pagliuca is going to go into detail, we should be having this at side bar under seal, if we're going to be discussing the details of her family. THE COURT: Yes. MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay. THE COURT: The court reporter requested, so she can sit, that we do it in the robing room. (Pages 1590 to 1601 SEALED) (Continued on next page) SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
