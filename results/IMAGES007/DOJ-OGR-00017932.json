Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the relationship of trust and attachment between a victim and a perpetrator affect whether a victim tells someone about the abuse? A. Yes. Q. Can you explain how? A. One of the things that we know when we look at when do victims of childhood sexual abuse tell and who do they tell is we know that they are less likely to tell and more likely to have a delay in telling the closer the relationship to the perpetrator. Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you familiar with a concept called \"delayed disclosure\"? A. I am. Q. Can you explain for the jury what delayed disclosure is. A. Delayed disclosure really just refers to when does someone tell. So in the case of delayed disclosure in terms of child sexual abuse, we would call disclosure telling delayed when it happens at some point after the abuse has occurred. Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the victim's age? A. Yes. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017932",
