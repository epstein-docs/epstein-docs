COMEY: Your Honor, I think it depends on the length of cross-examination for some of the more substantial witnesses. If we can expect about the same length as we have with Jane today, I expect we'll be able to rest the third week of trial. So not next week, but the week after, early that week is my best estimate.\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7 THE COURT: And what's the defense's best estimate?\n8 MS. STERNHEIM: We'll let you know.\n9 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to suspect the length of cross-examination will be less for the remaining witnesses.\n10\n11 THE COURT: We worked out some --\n12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Kinks, yes.\n13 But I just think substantively it's likely to be less, and there's likely -- well, with the exception of one, there's less 3500 impeachment material that needs to be gone through potentially, so I think that will shorten the length of cross-examination. And we will have whatever we need to have ready to go, understanding the format we're doing this in now.\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19 THE COURT: All right. See you in the morning.\n20 (Adjourned to December 2, 2021 at 8:45 a.m.)\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00017872",
