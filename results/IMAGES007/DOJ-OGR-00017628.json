MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n3 I just wanted to report to the Court, we had a chance to confer about those two issues. We've narrowed the scope of disagreement to just one issue after conferring with the witness's counsel, which we'd like to raise at sidebar. I don't know how soon that will come up, so I defer to defense counsel whether to do that now or whether it would be more efficient to bring the jury out and deal with that at a break.\n10 There's a second issue to flag, but let me just pause there on that to see.\n12 THE COURT: Sure.\n13 Is it anytime soon, Ms. Menninger?\n14 MS. MENNINGER: I don't think so, but I don't have it all memorized.\n16 THE COURT: Understand. Let's hope we get to the break and then we'll take it.\n18 What else?\n19 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n20 Defense counsel provided the government with a number of exhibits, and we appreciated the chance to review those in order to raise issues in advance. We just wanted to flag that for two of those we anticipate there being a Rule 408 objection. Again, I don't know how quickly that will arise, so I just wanted to alert that to the Court.
