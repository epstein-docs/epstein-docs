Maxwell, No. 15-cv-7433 (S.D.N.Y) (Count 5); and committed perjury in the July 2016 deposition in Giuffre v. Maxwell (Count 6). App. 13-30.\n\nThe civil case.\n\nGiuffre v. Maxwell is a long-dismissed defamation case in which Virginia L. Giuffre alleged that Ms. Maxwell defamed her. The alleged defamation centered on a statement from Ms. Maxwell's attorney-hired press agent generally denying as \"untrue\" and \"obvious lies\" plaintiff's numerous allegations, over the span of four years, that Ms. Maxwell participated in a scheme causing her to be \"sexually abused and trafficked\" by Epstein. The case settled after discovery and before trial, and the district court dismissed the case with prejudice in May 2017.\n\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00019405",
