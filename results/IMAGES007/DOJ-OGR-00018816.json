C-9, question 16. This is an amendment to the prior question 16 by the witness. And the witness added in this amendment: I was also transported via private car provided by Jeffrey Epstein. It's significant, your Honor, in that the witness had the opportunity to think about, reflect, add information here, and did not. And it is important in the context of this case where there's this changed memory over time. THE COURT: Okay. I see the inconsistency. MR. PAGLIUCA: Thank you. THE COURT: 16 I'll allow. What else? MR. PAGLIUCA: I think that's it -- well, then there's -- well, I think that's it. THE COURT: Okay. We really need to get the jury back. MS. STERNHEIM: Can we just have five minutes, Judge? THE COURT: You can take five. MS. COMEY: And, your Honor, can I ask how long we have left on cross-examination? I think it's been longer than the direct at this point. THE COURT: I'm stepping down. You can ask the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018816",
