Ms. Maxwell's lawyers showed this was false and that they did not give anything to Ms. Maxwell. Doc. 258. In addition, there was a videotape of the incident. But the government refused to review it and refused to provide it to the court. The defense insisted on having a hearing and that it be provided with the videotape of the attorney-client visit so that it could show that the MDC statements to the government were false. The court declined to have a hearing or order the videotape turned over. The truth is actually out there. We simply want an opportunity to demonstrate it at a hearing. Ironically, the court then blamed the defense for failing to provide proof of its claims. The defense has, over and over again, requested hearings and that the videotapes of what is occurring in jail be produced. But the district court said that the defense \"describes generalized grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application for relief.\" Doc. 282. This is an odd reason to deny Ms. Maxwell relief, especially where even the government admits that guards flash a light in Ms. Maxwell's cell every 15 minutes and that she is not provided an eye mask. We have said and continue to say that we would like production of 8 DOJ-OGR-00020334",
