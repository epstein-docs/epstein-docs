Shelly Lewis was someone Epstein was romantically involved with in 2002; is that right? 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. And she had a British accent, didn't she? 4 A. Yes. 5 Q. In fact, Epstein flew around with a lot of women who had foreign accents, didn't he? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. All right. Now, one quick question, you mentioned on your direct that Ghislaine had a share, I think, in a charter plane that she could use; is that right? 8 A. Yes. 9 Q. That's like sharing a plane, you can't use it anytime you want; right? 10 A. You have to request it. It's not there at your beckon call. 11 Q. Because other people use that same plane; right? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. But isn't it true that Ghislaine only had that share in the 1990s; right? 14 A. I'm not sure how many years she had it. She didn't have it forever, that's for sure. 15 Q. So, for example, in the 2000s, if she wanted to fly not on Jeffrey Epstein's plane, she'd have to fly commercial, not on that share of a jet? 16 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
