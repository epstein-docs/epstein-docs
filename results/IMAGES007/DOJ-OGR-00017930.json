So these are vulnerabilities that have been found to be specific to child sexual abuse risk. Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, Dr. Rocchio, are you familiar with the term \"attachment\"? A. I am. Q. What is attachment? A. Attachment really refers to the relationship and connection between two people. The research was initially done looking at the caregiver attachment, so typically the relationship that it develops between a mother and an infant. But it's since expanded to look at relationships between other caregivers and children, as well as adults. Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between attachment and grooming. A. So in the context of building a relationship of trust and using coercion and deception and lies in order to manipulate the child, one of the things that offenders are doing is trying to create increased dependency, trust, and attachment. They hold themselves out as somebody who is special to the child, and the child feels often very special, and that there's something unique and important and valuable about their relationship with the perpetrator.
