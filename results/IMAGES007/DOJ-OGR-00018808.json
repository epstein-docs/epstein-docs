It was the second\n3 incident where Jeffrey Epstein brought another female into the\n4 room. She testified that he briefly penetrated her twice\n5 during that incident. So he inserted his penis into her two\n6 times during that one incident and that was it. So it's one\n7 incident.\n8 THE COURT: Okay. I'm re-persuaded. I'm going to\n9 sustain on 39. But you can ask the question about are there\n10 any allegations in the complaint regarding penetrative sex,\n11 which is as she testified to.\n12 Next paragraph.\n13 MR. PAGLIUCA: 51.
