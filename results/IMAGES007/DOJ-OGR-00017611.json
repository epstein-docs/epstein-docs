Matters to take up, counsel, includes the Rule 16/608, as I see it, issue. And then I want to see where you are in terms of working out anticipated personal identifying information of witnesses who I've given permission to testify under pseudonyms to protect their privacy.\nSo let's begin.\nMs. Menninger, did you want to begin with the Rule 16 issue?\nMS. MENNINGER: I think Mr. Everdell was going to handle that piece.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nMs. Comey, are you taking this?\nMR. ROHRBACH: I'm taking this one, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: You all swapped off.\nSo I think the defense is clearly right that if we are talking by impeachment by contradiction, that is to say, impeachment, direct contradiction of something testified to on the stand, it's not required to be disclosed as case-in-chief material under Rule 16; and depending on what it is, it's likely not 608 because it's impeachment by contradiction, not impeachment to show -- extrinsic evidence to show a character for dishonesty and the like.\nSo the question is whether it's impeachment or not.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
