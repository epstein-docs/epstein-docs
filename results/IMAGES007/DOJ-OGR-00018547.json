Focusing on Government Exhibit 903-R and focusing on the foreground of the exhibit, do you see the item with the white sheet? A. Yes, I do. Q. And what is that object? A. That particular object is a green in color massage table. It was covered with a navy blue blanket; and then on top of that, a white in color sheet. You obviously see a blue in color towel that's also placed on top of the table. Q. Were there curtains in this room? A. Yes, there were. Those are the large pink curtains that are visible in the photograph. MS. MOE: Ms. Drescher, if you could please take 903-R down and show just the witness, counsel, and the Court what's been marked for identification as Government Exhibit 904-R. Q. Do you recognize this? A. Yes, I do. Q. What is Government Exhibit 904-R? A. This is just another angle inside the massage room. Q. Is this a fair and accurate depiction of a separate angle of the interior of the massage room? A. Yes, ma'am, that's correct. MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government offers Government Exhibit 904-R.
