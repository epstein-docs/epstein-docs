  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 749 Filed 08/10/22 Page 129 of 236 LC3KMAX4 Parkinson - Direct containing a depiction of a very young minor. You should not infer from this photo that Mr. Epstein had a sexual attraction to minors as young as the girl depicted in this photo. You also may not consider this evidence as any kind of reflection on Ms. Maxwell's character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the indictment. However, to the extent you conclude that the evidence is relevant to the issues before you, you can consider it.\" THE COURT: Okay. And the defense's request is not to give it because you don't want to highlight the photo that otherwise might be just in passing and so, rather, your request is not to give the instruction? MR. EVERDELL: That's correct, your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. What else? MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I just wanted to note that, after conferring, the parties have agreed to offer a redacted version of Government Exhibit 296, which is the video. The portion we've agreed to redact is a portion at the beginning where Detective Recarey reads aloud the entire search warrant for several minutes. So we have redacted that from the version that we will ask be accepted into evidence and that we will actually play for the jury. THE COURT: Okay. What else? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018230",
