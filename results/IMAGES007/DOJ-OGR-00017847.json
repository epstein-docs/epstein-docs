That is entirely consistent with her testimony that she was, in fact, abused. MS. STERNHEIM: But not with regard to her mother having a confrontation. THE COURT: Well, it's a prior consistent statement that he heard related to the abuse which you've repeatedly called into question in your opening and your direct and in your cross-examination. MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I understand that. But we're talking about prior consistent statements. THE COURT: Right. The prior consistent statement is that she was abused by Jeffrey Epstein. MS. STERNHEIM: But they are bringing out a conversation. If she wants to say, Did you know or learn that she was abused? Yes. But a conversation that she had with her mother is hearsay. MS. MOE: Your Honor, it's not hearsay because it's a prior consistent statement of Jane about her experiencing sexual abuse. THE COURT: Yes. Overruled.
