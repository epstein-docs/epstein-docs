Maxwell, No. 20-3061 (the \"criminal case,\" Case No. 20-CR-330\n(AJN) (S.D.N.Y.)), with the pending appeal in Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-\n2413 (the \"civil case,\" Case No. 15-CV-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y.)).1\nBackground\nThese two appeals are inextricably intertwined. As Ms. Maxwell explained in\nher opening brief in the civil case, the district court unsealed the deposition\nmaterial without knowing critical new information discovered to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe criminal case bearing directly on whether the deposition material should be\nunsealed. Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-2413, OB, pp 13-15.\n1 Since Ms. Maxwell seeks to consolidate both appeals, she is filing this\nmotion in both cases. But because of the protective order in the criminal case,\nExhibit A, Ms. Maxwell can file an unredacted version of this motion in the\ncriminal appeal only. She cannot file an unredacted version of this motion in the\ncivil appeal.\nAccordingly, in the criminal appeal, Ms. Maxwell will file a sealed and\nunredacted copy of this motion along with a motion for leave to file under seal. She\nwill publicly file on ECF the redacted copy of this motion.\nIn the civil appeal, Ms. Maxwell will file on ECF the redacted copy of this\nmotion only.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-00019289",
