That is 18 U.S.C. 3142(g).\nNow that the court has laid out the federal statutory requirements that guide its bail determination, it turns to the government's specific application in this case for detention pending trial.\nThe government does not argue, as has been repeatedly made clear today, for detention based on danger to the community. Instead, it rests its argument for detention on Ms. Maxwell's alleged risk of flight. As noted in a flight-risk case, the government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant presents an actual risk of flight and that no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure her presence in court.
