As already noted, if civil discovery were to proceed, Maxwell would have to make the difficult decision of whether to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege - a decision that could adversely impact her position in one or the other of the cases she is defending. See Louis Vuitton, 676 F.3d at 97. Also, due to heightened restrictions at the MDC during the COVID-19 pandemic (restrictions of which this Court takes judicial notice), this Court understands that counsel has had difficulty, and will likely continue to have difficulty, meeting with Maxwell and arranging for her to review documents or otherwise to confer for the purpose of preparing a defense to this civil case. (See 8/19/20 Menninger Ltr., at 5; see also 9/4/20 Menninger Reply Ltr., at 2-3.)\n\nThis Court finds that not only the existence of the criminal prosecution against Maxwell, but also the particularly (and unusually) restrictive circumstances of her current detention, would necessarily make it harder for Maxwell to participate fully in the discovery process in this action, and would cause her undue prejudice, weighing strongly in favor of a stay.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-00019453",
