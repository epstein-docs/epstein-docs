PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, on this point, I have a related request, and that is, I think, from the defense perspective, if Ms. Comey or the prosecutors simply want to say, we move for this under seal, without then the rest of the explanation over and over and over again, that's fine with us. I just think, again, to Ms. Sternheim's point, it highlights sort of why are we doing this. It's fine for the record, I think, and if then we need to make a further record down the road, I don't think we need to expand the reasons for all of this. So I think we're fine with under seal. MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor. I'm just trying to set forth the basis, but whatever your Honor would like me to do, I'm happy to just offer it under seal. THE COURT: I need to know what the basis is, that it's being offered under seal for, and I need to find that that's appropriate. So sometimes that's obvious, but it's not always obvious, so I want to take your suggestion, Mr. Pagliuca, but I guess I'm concerned -- MR. PAGLIUCA: Believe me, we've been through the sealing issues up and down 35 times here -- THE COURT: My job is to make sure that we're not oversealing anything. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
