And so it confirms that a person with that name was contacting the house during the relevant timeframe of the charged conspiracy. 6 THE COURT: Just so I understand the government's argument, you are offering for the truth, but it's the hearsay exception that proffering is the business record exception? 9 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. If I could just have one moment. 11 THE COURT: Yes. 12 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Just to be more precise. 13 I've been using the shorthand business records, but here the issue is about whether it's record of a regularly conducted activity within an organization. 16 THE COURT: Mr. Pagliucca. 17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor. Just so that the record is clear, there are four, I will call them message slips per page. Many of these message slips don't have dates, don't have signatures, and have very sort of cryptic explanations about what is or isn't being purported to be recorded here. 22 This witness, I think, maybe has the ability to authenticate four or five of these separate slips, but has no knowledge about the other slips. 25 THE COURT: I'm sorry. So is that a 901 objection? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00018934",
