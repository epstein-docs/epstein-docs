  "full_text": "Case 1:21-cr-02949-MVIT Document 206 Filed 06/06/22 Page 8 of 16\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebutted the presumption in § 3142(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for his release.\nSection 3142(g) then lays out the following factors for courts to consider: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a violation of § 1591, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled substance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the defendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g).\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release, they do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr. Robertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government in an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2021 pretrial conference, it takes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come forward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our criminal justice system.\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one hand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other witness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior to the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and place of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n8\nDOJ-OGR-00020216",
