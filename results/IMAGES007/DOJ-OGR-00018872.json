The relevance is extraordinarily remote as there is nothing to tie in the relationship or to suggest that Virginia Roberts was at Mar-a-Lago during the period of time that Juan Alessi claims to have seen her.

The relevance for these documents arises in three respects. First of all - and this is an initial matter - Sky Roberts, the evidence already in the case shows that there is a Virginia Roberts with a father named Sky Roberts, as shown on her birth certificate. So these documents are relevant to connect the Virginia Roberts in the birth certificate to a Virginia Roberts who was present in the area of Mar-a-Lago in the year 2000 which allows the jury to draw the inference that that is the Virginia Roberts who has been the subject of testimony by Carolyn and Juan Alessi and others.
