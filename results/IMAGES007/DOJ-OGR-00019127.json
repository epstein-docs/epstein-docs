EVERDELL: Just a few procedural things from the defense.\n2\n3 I believe the next witness from the government is going to be Tracy Chapell from Federal Express. And I have some documents I can hand up to the Court. I have one exhibit that I intend to introduce through Ms. Chapel which I've given to the government; I can give the Court a copy. It's going to be done in paper.\n4\n5 These are Federal Express invoices.\n6\n7 I'm going to offer them -- assuming they are allowed to be admitted, I will offer them under temporary seal because we haven't had the chance to go through and do all the redactions. But we will do that as soon as we can and get the Court a redacted copy so that that could be published publicly.\n8\n9 But for the moment, we'll have to do this under seal.\n10\n11 THE COURT: Is there going to be a lot of walking the witness through the document?\n12\n13 MR. EVERDELL: No. Actually I'm just going to admit them; no walking through, it's going to be for the jury's eyes if they want to see it.\n14\n15 THE COURT: Okay. And so a redacted version for the public by when?\n16\n17 MR. EVERDELL: If we could do it over the weekend, because there's a decent number of records, and have them ready by Monday, we could do that.\n18\n19 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
