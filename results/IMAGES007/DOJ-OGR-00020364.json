Judge Nathan further noted that Maxwell \"possesses extraordinary financial resources,\" lacks \"any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,\" and made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that \"likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.\" (Id. at 83-84). Accordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating that Maxwell \"poses a substantial actual risk of flight\" and that \"even the most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient\" to ensure Maxwell's appearance, especially in light of her \"demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her financial] resources and herself.\" (Id. at 86-87). Judge Nathan also rejected Maxwell's arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated, finding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell's access to her counsel. Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense \"to provide adequate communication between counsel and client\" and invited the defense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the process was \"inadequate in any way.\" (Id. at 90-91).\n6\nDOJ-OGR-00020364",
