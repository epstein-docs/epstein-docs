Judge Nathan's Oversight of Maxwell's Conditions of Confinement\n26. As she indicated she would, Judge Nathan has closely monitored Maxwell's conditions of confinement, including by ordering the Government to submit regular updates regarding that topic (see Gov't Ex. A (compiling update letters and relevant court orders)), and, in one instance, ordering the MDC to provide Maxwell access to a Government-issued laptop on weekends and holidays (see id. at 10-11). The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2021, noting, among other things, Maxwell's extensive access to discovery and communications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor recreation; the thirteen hours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with exclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shower; and her access to medical care, including the COVID-19 vaccine, which she has now received.
