And that research has repeatedly\n5 demonstrated that when people -- when you ask people if they\n6 acknowledge that they've been abused, particularly sexually\n7 abused, during childhood, and then you ask them if they ever\n8 told anyone, a significant number will say no, not until this\n9 interview. And then others will say yes, and then they are\n10 asked when they've told. And we know from the research that\n11 often they don't tell until adulthood.\n12 Q. In your clinical and forensic practices, have you treated\n13 and evaluated patients who did not disclose sexual abuse they\n14 experienced as children, but disclosed such abuse later?\n15 A. Yes.\n16 Q. Without getting into any particular anecdotes of your\n17 practices, can you explain.\n18 A. I'm sorry, can you repeat the question.\n19 Q. Yes. Can you just explain -- let me ask it this way: In\n20 your own clinical practice, how common, if at all, is it for\n21 you to be the first person your patients have told they were\n22 abused?\n23 MR.
