It's a yes-or-no answer. Yes, I was shown materials. I don't believe that's privileged because there is no communication required, number 1.\n2 Number 2, in the event those materials are shown to the government in a meeting, they lose any putative privilege that they may have.\n3 Number 3, to the extent that they're intended to be communicated to a third party, they are not privileged to begin with, even if they're not shown to the third party. I believe that's the status of the law and that's my record. Thank you.\n4 THE COURT: Again, you might have been able to get there, but the question that you asked, I sustained on privilege.\n5 Next, anything?\n6 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank you.\n7 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.\n8 THE COURT: Was there another issue you wanted to make a record on, Mr. Pagliuca?\n9 MR.
