The question for him on the stand would be what he told his client. But the briefing would be on the waiver question. THE COURT: Well, right. But whether he waived -- whether the privilege -- it's the client's to waive, I think. That will be part of the briefing, I suppose. Okay. But if the answer is no, you don't have anything further for this witness? MS. MENNINGER: I understand, your Honor. THE COURT: That was a question. MS. MENNINGER: Yes, that's right. I understood your Honor to say there is no other question, so I -- THE COURT: Well, no, it was a question. If she says no, do you have other questions for her? MS. MENNINGER: On this topic, no.
