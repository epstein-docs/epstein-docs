MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. We just wanted to navigate that, otherwise I think we would make arrangements for Jane to travel home to her family today. And so if we wanted to make those arrangements, we will need to be in touch with her to make those arrangements, otherwise not planning to have substantive communications, but I wanted to be very transparent and candid about those contacts and just the state-of-play on this issue. MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, my recollection is that there was a second witness who was going to be offering prior consistent statements for Jane. MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. I think our preference would be for Jane to be permitted to leave the district, but if we can be in touch with her about the possibility of a need for recall after today, if there are additional prior consistent statements, we can navigate it that way. Otherwise, Jane would have to remain in the district for I think potentially a long time. MS. MENNINGER: I have no objection to that, your Honor.
