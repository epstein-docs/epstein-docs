So that's yet another expert's opinion in this field about 4 there being problems with this grooming moniker. Correct? 5 A. No. I wouldn't agree with that statement. 6 Q. There are some other studies that you provided to the 7 government that have not been introduced into evidence. And I 8 just want to ask you if you recall these. There is the study 9 \"Sexual Grooming of Children: Review of Literature and 10 Theoretical Considerations.\" Do you recall that? 11 A. The title is familiar.
