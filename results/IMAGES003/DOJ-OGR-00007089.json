PAGLIUCA: On this topic your Honor? 3 THE COURT: Yes. 4 MR. PAGLIUCA: No. 5 THE COURT: Ms. Moe? 6 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you. 7 THE COURT: The next is government 9 which is to preclude evidence or argument sounding in nullification. I 8 agree with the defense that there is no need for me to rule on 9 this presently. I trust that defense counsel knows well the 10 clear rules around any such arguments so it is a bit hard to 11 think about what guidance I can offer here. 12 Ms. Moe, is there a specific concern you want to 13 raise? 14 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. 15 Aside from the examples we proffered in our motion, 16 there is nothing in particular that this motion is aimed at and 17 so I don't think anything more along those lines to address 18 today. 19 MS. STERNHEIM: Nothing at this time. 20 THE COURT: OK. So nothing referenced with respect to 21 the government's concerns about nullification would be 22 implicated in the anticipated opening? 23 MS. STERNHEIM: That is correct. 24 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007089",
