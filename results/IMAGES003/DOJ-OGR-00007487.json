In response, the National Research Council formed a committee, co-chaired by the Honorable Jed Rakoff and Thomas Albright, a prominent cognitive scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. In 2014, the committee published its report: Identifying the Culprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification (Natl. Res. Coun. 2014): “Human visual perception and memory are changeable, the ability to recognize individuals is imperfect, and policies governing law enforcement procedures are not standard—and any of these limitations can produce mistaken identifications with serious consequences” Id. The committee recommended that judges admit expert testimony as a way of educating juries on the science of memory. An alternative recommendation, having the court deliver a carefully crafted jury instructions that could accomplish this same educational goal, requires the daunting task of devising the right instructions.
