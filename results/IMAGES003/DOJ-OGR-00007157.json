MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: All right. Any questions about any of those rulings? MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank you. MR. PAGLIUCA: No, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: And about the time frames I have set on the different pieces that I require briefing on after everybody has. And, you will get the transcript. MS. MOE: Understood, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: All right. With that, I think we can pick up some outstanding logistics issues and I will hear from counsel as to any issues they want to raise. So, we begin our questionnaire process on Thursday. The government -- my chambers will produce the copies as an original matter. The government will take the completed copies from the jury department -- the completed questionnaires with no identifying information and make copies for the defense and for the Court. My request is to give both a paper copy and an electronic copy. I think that will aid everybody's use of the document since we have got multiple people looking at them, and then of course return the originals to the Court. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
