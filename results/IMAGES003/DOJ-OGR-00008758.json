It 3 is sufficient as long as all of you find that at least one overt act was committed by one of the 4 conspirators. 5 6 As to Counts One and Three, the Government has to prove that at least one of the overt 7 acts in furtherance of that conspiracy involved a witness other than Kate. Put simply: you may 8 not convict Ms. Maxwell on Counts One or Three solely on the basis of Kate's testimony or an 9 overt act involving Kate. 10 You are further instructed that the overt act need not have been committed at precisely 11 the time alleged in the Indictment.
