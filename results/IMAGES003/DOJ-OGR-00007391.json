Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nNovember 22, 2021\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nPursuant to the Court's Orders at Dkt. Nos. 473, 474, and 476, the parties are docketing today the Government's motion to quash the defendant's Rule 17(c) subpoena, proposed redacted versions of the Government's letter motion of November 18, 2021 and the defendant's response, and proposed redacted versions of the defendant's response relating to Government Exhibit 52 and the Government's reply.\nThe defense has informed the Government that they are not seeking redactions to these filings.\nThe Government's proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).\nAlthough the parties' supplemental briefing and the Court's Opinion & Order are judicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the limited proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of the Minor Victims and witnesses, including individuals who have not identified themselves on the record in this case, and who are subjects of the Court's pseudonym order.\nDOJ-OGR-00007391",
