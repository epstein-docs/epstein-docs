The terms \"persuaded,\" \"induced,\" and \"enticed,\" and \"coerced\" have their ordinary, everyday meanings.\n\nThe term \"interstate commerce\" simply means movement from one state to another. The term \"State\" includes a State of the United States and the District of Columbia.\n\n\"Knowingly\" Defined\n\nThe defendant Ms. Maxwell must have acted knowingly. An act is done knowingly when it is done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of accident, mistake, or some other innocent reason.\n\nNow, knowledge is a matter of inference from the proven facts. Science has not yet devised a manner of looking into a person's mind and knowing what that person is thinking.\n\nWhether the defendant Ms. Maxwell acted knowingly may be proven by the defendant's Ms. Maxwell's conduct and by all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.\n\nAdapted from Sand et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instr. 64-7; the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United States v. Pizzaro, 17 Cr. 151 (AJN) and in United States v. Le, 15 Cr. 38 (AJN); the charge of the Hon. Denise L. Cote in United States v.
