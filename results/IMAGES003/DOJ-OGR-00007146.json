That list includes some of the minor victims in this case that the jury will learn about in this trial. THE COURT: It's not going to be talked about in openings, but before in front of the jury this full authentication process happens, I would like the government to put out specifically what it intends to enter into evidence with respect to this, and with specificity, who will provide authentication and the proffer as to that testimony. And you will deal with the timeframe questions that have been raised as well. MS. MOE: Certainly, your Honor. THE COURT: I need to see a little bit more than what's been suggested, and I need to have a better understanding of what is potentially being offered for. MS. MOE: Understood, your Honor, certainly. THE COURT: So when would you like to do that? MS. MOE: Your Honor, may I confer with my colleagues? THE COURT: Sure. (Pause) MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. Could we possibly submit it on November 10, along with other briefing that date? THE COURT: That's fine. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007146",
