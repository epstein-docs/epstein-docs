  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 459 Filed 11/15/21 Page 42 of 43 42 LalWmaxC acoustical issues that I would hope might be addressed by the tech department. THE COURT: We've spent a fair amount of time talking about that, and the acoustics won't be as good as they would be in 500 Pearl, but there are other very good reasons to be where we'll be. I can assure you that the D.E.'S Office and my chambers will continue to work to make it as good as it can possibly be in an old courtroom. But I feel confident, based on what we've done so far and what I hope will continue to be the case, that it's going to work well. MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you. MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I wanted to just raise one issue, which is that the government is aware of certain courtroom sketches of Jeffrey Epstein at, I believe, 500 Pearl, and so just wanted to raise that for the Court and understanding that such sketches would be removed before the selection process. THE COURT: OK. I think that's a good suggestion, and I will talk to the D.E.'S Office. MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you very much, your Honor. THE COURT: Anything else? Ms. Pomerantz. MS. POMERANTZ: Nothing further. Thank you. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim. MS. STERNHEIM: Nothing further. I do thank the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007014",
