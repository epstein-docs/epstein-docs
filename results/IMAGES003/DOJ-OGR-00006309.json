SILVERMAN DAVID MILITIAMEN Experienced and Respected, 'Resilient and Resourceful' 1,400 at the bar of MDC. MDC s, as MDC and the Government have stipulated. I therefore conclude that the Government has met its burden and that the ends of justice would be served by a continuance and an exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B)(iv), and that the period of time from March 8, 2019 (when the last status hearing was held) up to and including April 11, 2019 is hereby excluded under the Speedy Trial Act. The Court finds that the failure to grant a continuance would deny counsel for the defendant and counsel for the Government the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the exercise of due diligence. IT IS SO ORDERED. 11/6/18 Page 2",
