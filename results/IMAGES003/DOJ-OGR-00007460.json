First, you must not talk to each other about this case\n4 or about anyone who has anything to do with it until the end of the case when you\n5 go to the jury room to decide your verdict. The reason for this requirement is that\n6 you must not reach any conclusion on the charges until all of the evidence is in.\n7 As I have said, keep an open mind until you start your deliberations at the end of\n8 the case.\n9 Second, do not communicate with anyone else about this case or about\n10 anyone who has anything to do with it until the trial has ended and you have been\n11 discharged as jurors. Anyone else includes members of your family and your\n12 friends. And no communicating about the case means no communicating on your\n13 cell phone, iPhone, Blackberry, text messaging, websites, internet chat rooms,\n14 email, social media websites or applications (including Facebook, Instagram,\n15 Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) - or by any other means. I know in this\n16 day and age there is temptation to look to these devices or means of\n17 communication, but with your oath you are making a commitment to resist that\n18 temptation. You may tell your family and friends that you are a juror in a criminal\n19 case, but you may not tell them anything else about it until you have been\n20 discharged by me.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-00007460",
