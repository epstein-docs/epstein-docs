The most important\n3 part of this case, members of the jury, is the part that you as jurors are now about to play as you\n4 deliberate on the issues of fact. It is for you, and you alone, to weigh the evidence in this case\n5 and determine whether the Government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the\n6 essential elements of the crime with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. If the Government has\n7 succeeded, your verdict should be guilty as to that charge; if it has failed, your verdict should be\n8 not guilty as to that charge.\n9 You must base your verdict solely on the evidence or lack of evidence and these\n10 instructions as to the law, and you are obliged under your oath as jurors to follow the law as I\n11 have instructed you, whether you agree or disagree with the particular law in question.\n12 Under your oath as jurors, you are not to be swayed by sympathy. You should be guided\n13 solely bye the evidence presented during the trial and the law as I gave it to you, without regard\n14 to the consequences of your decision. You have been chosen to try the issues of fact and reach a\n15 verdict on the basis of the evidence or lack of evidence. If you let sympathy interfere with your\n16 clear thinking, there is a risk that you will not arrive at a just verdict.\n17 As you deliberate, please listen to the opinions of your fellow jurors, and ask for an\n18 opportunity to express your own views. Every juror should be heard. No one juror should hold\n19 center stage in the jury room and no one juror should control or monopolize the deliberations.\n20 If, after listening to your fellow jurors and if, after stating your own view, you become\n21 convinced that your view is wrong, do not hesitate because of stubbornness or pride to change\n22 your view. On the other hand, do not surrender your honest convictions and beliefs solely\n23 because of the opinions of your fellow jurors or because you are outnumbered. Your final vote\n24 must reflect your conscientious belief as to how the issues should be decided.\n81\nDOJ-OGR-00008620",
