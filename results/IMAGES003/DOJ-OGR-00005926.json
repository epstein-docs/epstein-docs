(continued) Study | Design | Sample | Findings | Summary Kogan (2004) | The purpose of this study was to identify factors that influence the disclosure made by female survivors of childhood sexual abuse and to assess the representativeness of structured phone interviews USEs. The receipt of both the disclosure and the management of the disclosure were investigated. | A subsample of 263 adolescent females between 12 and 17 years old, mean age of 15.2 years, who reported at least one experience of sexual contact with an adult in the NSA, was assessed using a modified CSA Incident Classification Interview. They asked a series of questions about each episode of unwanted sexual contact and character of the perpetrator. | Sample consisted of 218 child disclosure 'constructors' of CSA, referred to CSA 'offenders' for a 'legged' CSA. A total of 218 child disclosure 'constructors' of CSA, referred to CSA 'offenders' for a 'legged' CSA. Five factors were tested: (1) age of child disclosure, (2) type of abuse, (3) mode of disclosure, and (4) characteristics of the perpetrator. | This study examined factors associated with disclosure and the essence of USEs. Surveys noted that Y represent the sample (14-17). Ado escents who experienced sexual abuse were more likely to disclose to an adult (64%) than children aged 7-10 years. Children under 11 were at risk for delayed disclosure beyond 1-13 months. Children aged 11-13 tended to disclose to a family member or a friend. Immediate disclosure was associated with a stranger perpetrator. Fear of not being believed was a major reason for not disclosing. Family factors linked to disclosure were (1) drug abuse in the household and (2) prompt intervention. This study represents a higher rate of disclosure than previous studies. These cases had been reported to the authorities and were in process of prosecution, which may explain the higher rate of disclosure. Legal samples with higher rates of extrafamilial abuse (52%) may account for earlier disclosure. | This study does not own for defining the cause and effect on the actual onset of disclosure. D isclosure outcomes of the 26 women who did not disclose during ongoing abuse were continuously abused after disclosure. Children under the age of 7 were at risk for delayed disclosure. Participants whose USE occurred between the ages of 7 and 13 were more likely to disclose to an adult.
