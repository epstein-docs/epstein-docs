Law Offices of Bobbi C. Sternheim 33 West 19th Street-4th Fl. New York, NY 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Counsel: We write to notify you that the Government may seek to introduce certain evidence at trial. In particular, the Government may offer certain exhibits at trial that demonstrate that, in addition to the defendant's conduct with Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant took steps to please other influential men by providing them with access to women she selected for them. We are producing these proposed exhibits today, marked with the following exhibit numbers: GX 401 through 404, GX 409 through 410, and GX 413. In addition, please be advised that the Government may call [REDACTED] as a witness at trial. Today, we are producing Jencks Act materials relating to [REDACTED], who was employed by Jeffrey Epstein from [REDACTED]. The Government anticipates that [REDACTED] will testify about, among other things, certain documentary evidence relating to the charged crimes. The Government further anticipates that [REDACTED] will testify about her role in scheduling sexualized massages for Jeffrey Epstein with underage girls. DOJ-OGR-00006585",
