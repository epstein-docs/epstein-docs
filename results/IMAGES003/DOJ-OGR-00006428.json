Ms. Maxwell's counsel understand the rules of evidence and the law. Much of what may or may not happen in this trial will depend on the evidence produced by the government. Ms. Maxwell has no burden of proof and is not required to respond to hypothetical demands or provide previews about how she intends to cross examine witnesses. Consistent with prudent judicial practices, the Court should decline to rule on these hypothetical complaints. See Seymour v. Bache & Co., 502 F. Supp. 115, 119 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (\"In light of the uncertainties surrounding these legal issues, a potentially unnecessary, and thus merely advisory, ruling should be avoided.\"); In re Refco Cap.

Bennett, 680 F.3d 214 (2d Cir. 2012) (\"However, this request amounts to a demand for an advisory ruling as to the effect of an entirely hypothetical future pleading that might be asserted given the occurrence of contingent future events.\"); M.K. ex rel.
