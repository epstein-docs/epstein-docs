For example, if the government attempts to prove up the conspiratorial agreement or the knowledge of the illegal objective based on a pattern and practice, then evidence that Epstein acted alone or without Ms. Maxwell's knowledge or participation may become relevant.\n\nEach of the cases cited by the government is readily distinguishable. First, all but one of the cases dealt with specific \"good\" propensity evidence of the defendant, not the absence of a co-conspirator during \"bad\" acts by the defendant. See United States v. Dawkins, 999 F.3d 767 (2d Cir. 2021) (defendant - not a co-conspirator - proffered evidence that on other occasions he did not bribe other potential targets); United States v. Scarpa, 913 F.2d 993, 1011 (2d Cir. 1990) (absence of defendants' discussions about drugs on single occasion not admissible to \"disprove government's theory that the defendants congregated ... to discuss the marijuana business\"); United States v. Chambers, 800 F. App'x 43, 46 (2d. Cir. 2020) (summary order) (fact that defendant also ran a legitimate law practice not admissible to disprove he committed bad acts through illegal practice); Boyce v.
