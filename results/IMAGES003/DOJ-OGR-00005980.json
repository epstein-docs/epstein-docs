It makes all the difference in the world because Ms. Maxwell is on trial, not Mr. Epstein. The logic (such as it is) of grooming evidence is that the perpetrator normalizes sexual behavior to facilitate his latter abuse of the victim. But because Ms. Maxwell did not abuse anyone, there is no basis to conclude that anything she did was \"grooming.\" The government thus intends to have Rocchio characterize innocent conduct by Ms. Maxwell as something more nefarious, thereby further blurring the line that experts are already unable to draw reliably.
