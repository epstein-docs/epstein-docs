This opinion is therefore squarely within Dr. Rocchio's expertise.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that this testimony violates Rule 704, because it is an \"opinion that the alleged victims in this case are testifying truthfully,\" and 403, because it \"risks jurors accepting her 'expert' opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence.\" (Def. Mot. 3 at 13). Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated the victims in this case and will not express an opinion as to whether they are testifying truthfully. And the defense motion is entirely unclear on the features of this expert opinion that create risk that the jurors would abdicate their responsibilities.
