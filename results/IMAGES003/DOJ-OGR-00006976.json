As I've noted, the primary purpose of today's conference is to go through the questionnaire and voir dire procedures for jury selection. I've received the parties' joint proposed questionnaire and voir dire. The defendant filed a motion regarding the voir dire procedures, and I've considered those submissions as well, Dkt. No. 341, and the government's response at 355. I've also, in coming to resolution as to how to handle these procedures, considered examples of questionnaires and voir dire used for jury selection in many high-profile matters by my colleagues in this district and other districts. I've reviewed and studied case law on the subject, including Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., 464 U.S. 501 (1984); Presley v. Georgia, 558 U.S. 209 (2010); U.S. v. King, 140 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 1998); and ABC, Inc. v. Stewart, 360 F.3d 90 (2d Cir. 2004). And of course, all of this must be considered in conjunction with the district's COVID-19 protocols. As to that, as I noted, I've worked closely and extensively with the very hardworking folks in the clerk's office, including the jury department and the D.E.'S Office, to map out plans for how to effectuate my determinations as to the best way to proceed under all of these factors and SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
