NATHAN, District Judge:\nThe Court is in receipt of the parties' proposed redactions to the parties' motions in limine, responses in opposition, replies in support, and related exhibits. As the Court indicated at today's conference, some of the parties' proposed redactions are overbroad considering the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). In particular, for the reasons stated at today's conference, the Court denies the Government's request to redact section ten of the Government's motion in limine. See Dkt. No. 380. The Court will also not permit redactions pertaining to the general description of evidence or anticipated testimony as such redactions are unnecessary to protect the privacy interests of the individuals implicated. Accordingly, the parties must propose more tailored redactions consistent with the Court's discussion at today's conference.\nThe parties are ORDERED to submit the proposals to the Court via email by November 4, 2021. In order to facilitate the Court's review of the requests, the Court requires the parties to submit the proposed redactions as a single document and with the proposed redactions highlighted. The Defendant's proposed redactions should be highlighted in one color, and the Government's a different color.\nThe Court will rule on the proposed redactions expeditiously.\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00006029",
