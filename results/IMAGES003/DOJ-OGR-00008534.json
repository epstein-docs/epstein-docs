The documentary evidence will be sent back with you. If you want any of the testimony read to you, that can be arranged. But please remember that it is not always easy to locate what you might want, so be as specific as you possibly can in requesting portions of the testimony that you might want.\n4\n5 Your first task as a jury will be to choose your foreperson. The foreperson has no greater voice or authority than any other juror, but is the person who will communicate with the Court through written note when questions arise and to indicate when you have reached your verdict.\n6\n7 Your requests for testimony—in fact, any communications with the Court—should be made to me in writing, signed by your foreperson, and given to one of the Marshals. I will respond to any questions or requests you have as promptly as possible, either in writing or by having you return to the courtroom so I can speak with you in person. In any communication, please do not tell me or anyone else how the jury stands on the issue of the jury's verdict until after a unanimous verdict is reached.\n8\n9 For those of you who took notes during the course of the trial, you should not show your notes to or discuss your notes with any other juror during your deliberations. Any notes you have taken are to assist you and you alone. The fact that a particular juror has taken notes entitles that juror's views to no greater weight than those of any other juror.\n10\n11 Finally, your notes are not to substitute for your recollection of the evidence in this case. If you have any doubt as to any testimony, you may request that the official trial transcript that has been made of these proceedings be read or otherwise provided to you.\n12\n77\nDOJ-OGR-00008534",
