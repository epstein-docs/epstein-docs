Evidence of a prior inconsistent\n5 statement is not to be considered by you as affirmative evidence bearing on Ms. Maxwell's guilt.\n6 Evidence of the prior inconsistent statement was placed before you for the more limited purpose\n7 of helping you decide whether to believe the trial testimony of the witness who contradicted him\n8 or herself. If you find that the witness made an earlier statement that conflicts with his or her\n9 trial testimony, you may consider that fact in deciding how much of the trial testimony, if any, to\n10 believe.\n11 In making this determination, you may consider whether the witness purposely made a\n12 false statement or whether it was an innocent mistake; whether the inconsistency concerns an\n13 important fact or whether it had to do with a small detail; whether the witness had an explanation\n14 for the inconsistency; and whether that explanation appealed to your common sense.\n15 It is exclusively your duty, based on all of the evidence and your own good judgment, to\n16 determine whether the prior statement was inconsistent, and if so how much, if any, weight to be\n17 given to the inconsistent statement in determining whether to believe all or part of the witness's\n18 testimony.\n64\nDOJ-OGR-00008685",
