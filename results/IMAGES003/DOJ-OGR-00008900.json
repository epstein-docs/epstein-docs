Everdell\n+1 (212) 957-7600\neverdell@cohengresser.com\nFebruary 1, 2022\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nWe write in response to the Court's order, dated January 26, 2022, requiring the defense to file a letter on the public docket justifying our request to seal Ms. Maxwell's Motion for a New Trial and accompanying exhibits (collectively, the \"Motion\") under the three-part test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Dkt. 585.\nIntroduction\nThe Motion urges the Court to right a grievous wrong that deprived Ms. Maxwell of a fundamental constitutional right - her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury. Juror 50's responses to the jury questionnaire and questions posed to him during in-person voir dire corrupted the voir dire process and violated Ms. Maxwell's right to a fair trial. As set forth in the Motion, the defense believes that the existing record is clear and more than sufficient for the Court to grant Ms. Maxwell a new trial without the need for further factual development. Should the Court agree with the defense, the Motion could be unsealed and publicly docketed at the same time the Court issues its ruling with no additional delay.\n2087306.1\nDOJ-OGR-00008900",
