I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\nWhat is an \"inference\"? What does it mean to \"infer\" something? An inference is not a suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\n\nThere are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you will draw.\n\nThe process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a matter of guesswork or speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permitted but not required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\n\nTherefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from the facts that you find to be proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of your experience.\n\nSome inferences, however, are impermissible. You may not infer that the defendant Ms. Maxwell is guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the crime was being committed and had knowledge that it was being committed.
