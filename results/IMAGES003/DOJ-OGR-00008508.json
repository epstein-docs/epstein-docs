It is sufficient for the\n5 Government to show that any of the members of the conspiracy knowingly committed some\n6 overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Further, the overt act need not be one that is alleged in\n7 the Indictment. Rather, it can be any overt act that is substantially similar to those acts alleged in\n8 the Indictment, if you are convinced that the act occurred while the conspiracy was still in\n9 existence and that it was done in furtherance of the conspiracy as described in the Indictment. In\n10 addition, you need not be unanimous as to which overt act you find to have been committed.
