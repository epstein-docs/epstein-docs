If the defense wants to concede that she had this knowledge and intent, or that she played these roles, but only as to adults, it might reduce the probative value of evidence related to Minor Victim-3.

Siddiqui, 699 F.3d 690, 702 (2d Cir. 2012) (“A defendant may . . . forestall the admission of Rule 404(b) evidence by advancing a theory that makes clear that the object the Rule 404(b) evidence seeks to establish, while technically at issue, is not really in dispute.”).3 But to the extent that the defense argues that the defendant was not aware at all that Epstein’s massages were sexualized, for instance, or that she played no role in recruiting masseuses for Epstein at all, this evidence is highly probative to rebut those arguments.4\nAt its core, the defense argument is that the fact that the defendant and Epstein recruited a seventeen-year-old in the United Kingdom to provide sexualized massages to Epstein and to travel with them is not probative of whether they recruited a minor in the United States to provide sexualized massages to Epstein and to travel with them. The argument is meritless. This evidence\n3 Either way, Minor Victim-3’s testimony would still be relevant at least on the issue of motive. See Siddiqui, 699 F.3d at 702.\n4 To be clear, the evidence is admissible for the sex trafficking counts as well as the Mann Act counts.
