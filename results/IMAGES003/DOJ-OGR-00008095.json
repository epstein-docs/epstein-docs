None of the government's arguments is well taken, however, if only because, “as with an expert's qualifications and the reliability of his or her methodology, the liberality of Rule 702 insists that 'doubts about whether an expert's testimony will be useful should generally be resolved in favor of admissibility unless there are strong factors such as time or surprise favoring exclusions.'” Washington v.
