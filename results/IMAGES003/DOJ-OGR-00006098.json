Although the text of the law says the individual must be less than eighteen, because the New York criminal law provides that a person can consent to sexual activity if she is seventeen, this element requires that Ms. Maxwell knew that [Jane Doe-1 pseudonym]the individual was less than seventeen at the time of the offense.\n\nAdapted from Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instr. 64-19 (“Although section 2423(a) requires that the person transported be less than eighteen . . .
