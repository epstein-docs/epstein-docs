You also may not speculate as to the reasons why other persons are not on trial. Those matters are wholly outside your concern and have no bearing on your function as jurors.\n\nAdapted from the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United States v. Jones, 16 Cr. 553 (AJN) and in United States v. Pizarro, 17 Cr. 151 (AJN); the charge of the Hon. Kimba M. Wood in United States v. Almonte, 16 Cr. 670 (KMW); the charge of the Hon. Denise L. Cote in United States v. Purcell, 18 Cr. 081 (DLC); and the charge of the Hon. P. Kevin Castel in United States v. William Walters, 16 Cr. 338 (PKC).\n\nCommented [CE103]: For all the reasons given in Ms Maxwell's response to the government's motion in limine, this instruction is improper Without making a selective or vindictive prosecution argument, Ms Maxwell is entitled to challenge the thoroughness and competence of the government's investigation, this argument would unfairly blunt the force of that right, which Ms Maxwell has a constitutional right to present\n\nCommented [RA(104R103]: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE: As noted, this is also a standard instruction See also United States v. Berry, 20 Cr 84 (AJN) And as the Court has found, the Government's motivations are not at issue The presence or absence of other individuals from this trial has no relationship to the defendant's guilt or innocence of the charged crimes\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006151",
