We're going down to the bottom of page 5. 4 A. Yes. 5 Actually, you know, it's on my screen properly now, so it's going to be easier for me to look there, because it's bigger. 6 7 OK. 8 9 Q. So I want to just highlight here one of the problems with these studies that you're relying on is, we've got a comment, \"Two-thirds of the sample did not disclose right away.\" But we don't define what \"right away\" means, do we? 10 11 12 A. So to be clear, the article that I submitted was a summary of the literature. I'm not saying that I have read and examined every study cited in this particular article. So I really can't speak as to how those in this article identified or defined \"rate of disclosure.\" I would expect, however, that it would be defined in the full article itself. It's not defined here in the brief summary. But typically in scientific literature, it would -- the time period of disclosure that the authors were investigating, I would expect to find that in the article itself. 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Q. OK. But apparently you haven't gone back to look at the underlying data. Is that right? 24 25 A. I have not gone back to look at every reference cited in SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
