This can occur when people come to believe in these experiences and are not deliberately lying. Dr. Loftus would identify some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case.\nSuggestive activities can explain how it is that a person might go from having no memory of sexual abuse, and even denying sexual abuse, to later having \"memories\" for numerous abusive acts, if the memories are false.
