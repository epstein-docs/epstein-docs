NATHAN, District Judge:\nAs a post-trial house-keeping matter, attached to this Order are the Court Exhibits. The parties have proposed redactions to several exhibits and the sealing of Court Exhibit 4. The Court concludes that the proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006), and narrowly tailored. The redactions serve the purpose of protecting the anonymity of jurors and of victim-witnesses subject to the Court's anonymity order. With respect to Court Exhibit 4, rather than seal the entire document, the Court has redacted the information that would potentially identify the victim-witness who testified pursuant to the Court's anonymity order. Unredacted copies of the Court Exhibits will be filed under seal.\nSO ORDERED.\nDated: February 4, 2022 New York, New York\nALISON J. NATHAN United States District Judge\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00008863",
