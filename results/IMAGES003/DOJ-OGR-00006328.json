Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe government's opposition to releasing Ghislaine Maxwell from pretrial detention (Dkt. 423) is a long-winded regurgitation of prior writings and rulings and underscores its determination to ignore the presumption of innocence and punish Ms. Maxwell pretrial for her association with Jeffrey Epstein. The indictment against her federalizes a New York State B misdemeanor which carries a maximum penalty of 90 days. Ms. Maxwell, who awaits trial, has served that five times over. Ms. Maxwell is not, and has never been, a flight risk. At every opportunity, Ms. Maxwell has vigorously asserted her innocence and her eagerness to face these unsubstantiated charges in court. She should be allowed to do so outside of the confines of the MDC, where her conditions of confinement significantly impede her ability to prepare for trial, negatively impact her health, and compromise her stamina to endure the rigors of trial.\nThe Court now has the 3500 material and Giglio material which seriously undermine the strength of the government's case and underscore the lack of corroboration, facts which the government cannot and does not even attempt to refute. Rather, the government urges the Court to rely on prior rulings that were based on government conjecture that is not substantiated by recent disclosures. The Court and defense now have the witness statements, and they seriously call into question prior rulings based on the purported strength of the government's case.\nDOJ-OGR-00006328",
