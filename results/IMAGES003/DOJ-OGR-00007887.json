So those would be cases where it's been established that they've been abused. Q. During the course of your career, how old are the patients you've treated and evaluated who experienced childhood sexual abuse? A. I've treated, over the course of my career, individuals ages 13 and up. Q. And if this -- in your current practice, how old are the patients you treat? A. I'm currently working with individuals predominantly who are 18 and older. Q. In addition -- THE COURT: Sorry. What you're describing generally, is there a distinction to be made here in terms of your practice regarding childhood sexual abuse between your clinical side of your work and the forensic side? You're talking about your clinical work, I presume. THE WITNESS: I'm talking about my clinical work, but it is true that in both my clinical and forensic practice I have done a fair amount of work with adolescents as well as adults and that currently I am predominantly working in both settings with the evaluation of adults. THE COURT: OK. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007887",
