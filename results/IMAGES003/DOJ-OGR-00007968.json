What is it in your file that forms the basis of your\n3 opinion?\n4 A. There's nothing in my file that forms the basis of my\n5 opinion. What's in my file are, for example, the motion for\n6 today's hearing, a copy of the disclosure for some of the\n7 witnesses, a redacted copy of those sorts of things, but\n8 nothing from which I'm basing my opinion on today.\n9 Q. OK. You mentioned a contract. You're billing the\n10 government at a rate of $450 an hour. Is that correct?\n11 A. That is correct.\n12 Q. And your initial government contract is from $45,000. Is\n13 that right?\n14 A. Up to $45,000.\n15 Q. And how much have you been paid up to today?\n16 A. Nothing.\n17 Q. And so you need to complete your contract before you\n18 receive your $45,000; is that right?\n19 A. No. That's not my understanding. I need to prepare an\n20 invoice and provide it to the government. And I haven't had a\n21 chance to do that yet.\n22 Q. OK. And do you know what your final invoice will look like\n23 in terms of hours spent up till today?\n24 A. I don't at this point, no.\n25 Q. How many hours have you spent up till today?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00007968",
