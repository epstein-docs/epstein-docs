I'm not going to stick to that script exactly, I'm going to have a conversation with the jurors, but you know what I'm going to ask about. With respect to individual places and entities, the parties submitted that list to the Court last night, and what we'll do is the list, as we've discussed, contains the name of witnesses who I've permitted to testify under pseudonyms. So we've rearranged that list so it's by letter or number, we'll show the list to the prospective juror, ask them to read the names, do they recognize any of those names, and if so, to indicate what letter. If they indicate the letter of a witness who has been granted permission to testify under pseudonym, we'll discuss at sidebar and presumably sealed, so as not to identify that witness. The rest, to the extent a juror has knowledge of anyone on the list, it can be discussed in open court. Same for the list of entities. There's one inclusion on the list, I think just one, which is a specific employer name that I've indicated would not be discussed in open court because that would undermine the protection for the witness who has been granted permission to proceed by pseudonym. We'll bracket that for a moment. I want to discuss with the parties how I intend to handle that. But to the extent that might include discussing the specific employer, SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00008251",
