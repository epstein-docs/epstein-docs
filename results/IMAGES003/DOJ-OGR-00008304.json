It does not require ruling out \"all possibilities inconsistent with authenticity,\" or \"prov[ing] beyond any doubt that the evidence is what it purports to be.\" United States v. Dhinsa, 243 F.3d 635, 658 (2d Cir. 2001). Rather, all that is required is \"sufficient proof . . . so that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification.\" Id. This \"minimal\" standard can be satisfied by the \"testimony of a witness with knowledge that a matter is what it is claimed to be.\" United States v. Gagliardi, 506 F.3d 140, 151 (2d Cir. 2007). Once this \"minimal\" standard is met, \"the other party then remains free to challenge the reliability of the evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its meaning, but these and similar other challenges go to the weight of the evidence窶馬ot to its admissibility.\" United States v.
