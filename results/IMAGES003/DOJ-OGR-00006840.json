(continued) Study McEvaney and Cu hane (2015) Dumont, Messerschm tt: V a, Bohu, and Rey-Salmon (2014) Easton, Satzman, and W s (2014) Purpose To investigate the feasibility of using child disclosure assessments as data sources of CSA assessment and disclosure. To provide substantive evidence for how children disclose sexual abuse. This study examined how the perpetrator and intrafamilial CSA impact disclosure processes. Study focus was on barriers to CSA disclosure. Design Victim disclosure interviews structured on the QID questions. File reports of children seen for assessment and disclosure. To understand CSA disclosure, these reports were reviewed. File reports of children seen for assessment and disclosure. To understand CSA disclosure, these reports were reviewed. Using qualitative content analysis, researchers conducted a secondary analysis on one anonymous, Internet-based survey. Health data, the 2010 survey data, the We Being survey, were used. Survey that used CSA history as one of the organizations reported two-thirds of respondents reported CSA history. Age range 7 years old and 17 years old. Majority were female (78.2%) and had been arrested on 39 occasions and 7 based on a coded framework. Parents were asked to have the child reveal for the study, were assessed. 220 victims (78.2% female) were between 12-18 years of age (most range 14-18). 41.8% were abused by a family member and 41.8% by a non-family member. 460 men with CSA history completed an anonymous, Internet-based survey. Recruited from organizations. Age range 18-84 years. 30.2% less than 6 months, 32.3% 6 months to 3 years, and 34.3% more than 3 years. Ten categories of barriers were identified: (1) socio-cultural: masculinity resources; (2) interpersonal: mistrust of safety others, fear of not being believed; and (3) personal: internal emotional responses; past experiences of sexual abuse, and sexual abuse. Findings Majority of children (43%) first disclosed to their major themes: (1) fear/embarrassment; (2) opportunity to tell; and (3) themes of the bringing for disclosure. At time of the study, this was the largest qualitative data set to have been analyzed with an expert focus on adult male survivors' perceptions of barriers to CSA disclosure. Because the sample was not unique set of barriers to disclosure, 60% of victims revealed the facts done at school; contrary, extrafamilial CSA disclosure more spontaneously and quickly; 80% of victims revealed the facts often to mother or another family member. Vast majority of participants (94.6%) were abused by another male or female peers. Duration of sexual abuse broken down: 30.2% less than 6 months, 32.3% 6 months to 3 years, and 34.3% more than 3 years. Ten categories of barriers were identified: (1) socio-cultural: masculinity resources; (2) interpersonal: mistrust of safety others, fear of not being believed; and (3) personal: internal emotional responses; past experiences of sexual abuse, and sexual abuse. Summary Perspectives of offenders on victim disclosure by victims rested during the offense. Major findings on victim disclosure rested on dysfunctional backgrounds were key to their major themes: (1) fear/embarrassment; (2) opportunity to tell; and (3) themes of the bringing for disclosure. The sample size was relatively small but within the study in line and serves as an important exploratory process for bringing forward potential themes for consideration. The relationship with the perpetrator has a significant impact on both timing and recipient of disclosure, was disclosed promptly and within the family system. At time of the study, this was the largest qualitative data set to have been analyzed with an expert focus on adult male survivors' perceptions of barriers to CSA disclosure. Because the sample was not unique set of barriers to disclosure, 263 DOJ-OGR-00006840",
