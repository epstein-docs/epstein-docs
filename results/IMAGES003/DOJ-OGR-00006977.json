As I've indicated, we will do a screening questionnaire before jury selection. That questionnaire will prescreen for what I see as the major for-cause strike issues in the case. So, for example, the trial's length and schedule, a juror's personal knowledge of the parties, extent of a juror's awareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a result of the nature of the charges. This sort of questionnaire is, of course, very common in high-profile cases. I transmitted my draft questionnaire to counsel yesterday, and we'll discuss it shortly. As they typically do, the clerk's office will randomly assign juror numbers and create a corresponding list of names and juror numbers for the prospective jurors. That list will go to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection. On the questionnaire itself, jurors will be identified only by their assigned juror number. We will refer to the jurors in court throughout the process by their juror numbers only. The jury department will administer the questionnaire in morning and afternoon panels on November 4th, 5th and 12th. The procedure between questionnaires and voir dire will be as follows: SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
