We will be ready to strike, but your Honor will need to get to see whether, in that interval, there has been any impact on the ability of the panel that comes in to serve fairly and impartially. THE COURT: All right. Any final thoughts, Ms. Pomerantz? MS. POMERANTZ: Nothing further from the government. Thank you, your Honor. THE COURT: All right. I will consider it. You've all articulated factors I've considered, and I will see about the logistics issue, and I'll see if those can be worked out so that we have the option for either. And then what I may do is wait and see where we are as we head into the voir dire process before coming to final resolution. But to the extent I decide to do that, I will let you know, and I thank you for your input. OK.
