  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424-3 Filed 11/08/21 Page 9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations 103\nFor the purposes of our paper, we will define the term false allegations as either knowingly fabricated or claims based on abnormal information processing, because in some cases, the claimant may actually believe that a coerced sexual experience occurred in ways that it did not occur. In this paper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the likelihood of believing a sexual assault occurred when it did not. Additionally, some psychological disorders may be related to an increase in motivation to fabricate an allegation of sexual assault in an effort to achieve what may be believed are the positive consequences of a false report.\nPATHWAYS TO FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nThe pathways introduced in this section require further empirical investigation and validation. These may not be an exhaustive list of possible pathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been included.\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knowingly making a false claim of sexual assault is a pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway considered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences could be\n1. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual activity, pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases), and\n4. financial gain.\nIn sections below, we consider lying that comes out of other psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with antisocial personality disorder). In this pathway, we acknowledge that lying also occurs with “normal” individuals (i.e., individuals who have no psychiatric diagnosis, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus, the victim knowingly lying about the assault is a rather obvious pathway to false allegations. Deception is difficult to detect, but the alleged victim’s history of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need to be considered.\nDOJ-OGR-00006277",
