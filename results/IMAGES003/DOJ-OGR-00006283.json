Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act fitting diagnostic criterion 4. Furthermore, a lack of remorse could allow the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this allegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false claim of assault.\nAntisocial personality disorder occurs more in men than women (Lamont & Brunero, 2009; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), with prevalence rates of 3% and 1%, respectively, based on data from community samples (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Though women are the most frequent reporters of being victims of sexual assault, men may also report sexual assault. It is important to note that individuals with antisocial personality disorder are more likely than individuals without antisocial personality disorder to report having experienced sexual assault during their lifetime and are believed to be at a higher risk for sexual victimization (Burnam et al., 1988).\nBorderline Personality Disorder\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image (Lieb, Zanarini, Schmahl, Linehan, & Bohus, 2004). Prevalence estimates for BPD from community and clinical samples have ranged from .6% to 3.9% of the general population (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; van Asselt, Dirksen, Arntz, & Severen, 2007; as cited in Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2007), and the majority diagnosed with BPD—an estimated 75% of people—are women (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) includes nine diagnostic criteria for this disorder, which for simplicity can be narrowed down to four domains (Lieb et al., 2004). The first domain is affective disturbance that includes intense emotions, rapidly shifting emotions, and mood reactivity. The second domain is disturbed cognition that includes three levels of symptomatology: troubling but non-psychotic problems including dissociation (discussed above) and intense feelings of being bad (relevant to this pathway); quasi-psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms of delusions and hallucinations (further discussed below) that are somewhat reality-based; and psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. The third domain is impulsivity, either physically destructive to the self or generalized impulsivity. The fourth domain involves the existence of unstable and erratic relationships, in which the borderline individual struggles to avoid either real or imagined abandonment.\nDOJ-OGR-00006283",
