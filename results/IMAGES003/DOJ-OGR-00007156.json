This is a motion to preclude the admission of several exhibits. I'm going to grant the motion with respect to Exhibit 251 and 288.

I won't otherwise preclude this evidence. It is potentially corroborative evidence of testimony and 403 prejudice does not rule out 401 but the defense can maintain the search and authentication issues that we have discussed.\n\nExhibit 403 I won't preclude, it's potentially probative of the relationship between the defendant and Mr. Epstein.
