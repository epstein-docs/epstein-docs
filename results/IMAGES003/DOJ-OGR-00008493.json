For instance, it affects interstate commerce to use products that\n10 traveled in interstate commerce.\n11 It is not necessary for the Government to prove that Ms. Maxwell specifically knew or\n12 intended that her conduct would affect interstate commerce; it is only necessary that the natural\n13 consequences of such conduct would affect interstate commerce in some way, even if minor.\n14 If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the recruitment, enticement, harboring,\n15 transportation, providing, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex\n16 acts was economic in nature and involved the crossing of state lines, or was economic in nature\n17 and otherwise affected the flow of money to any degree, however minimal, you may find that the\n18 interstate commerce requirement of the offense of sex trafficking of a minor has been satisfied.\n19 I further instruct you that to find that this element has been proven beyond a reasonable\n20 doubt, it is not necessary for you to find that any interstate travel occurred.
