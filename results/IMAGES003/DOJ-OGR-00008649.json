I have already instructed you regarding that crime, and those instructions apply equally\n10 here.\n11 In order to establish this element, it is not necessary for the Government to prove that the\n12 illegal sexual activity was Ms. Maxwell's sole purpose for transporting Jane across state lines. A\n13 person may have several different purposes or motives for such conduct, and each may prompt in\n14 varying degrees the person's actions. The Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,\n15 however, that a significant or motivating purpose of Jane's travel across state lines was that she\n16 would engage in illegal sexual activity. In other words, the illegal sexual activity must not have\n17 been merely incidental to the trip.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-00008649",
