I think all that will be corroborative of witness testimony and, for the same reasons, certain items seized from the residence will be as well. For example, a massage table was seized from that residence and is marked as a government exhibit. THE COURT: Okay. Who is taking this one? MR. PAGLIUCA: This would be me, your Honor.
