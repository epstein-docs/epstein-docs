The failure to comply with the requirements of the Rule has deprived Ms. Maxwell of the opportunity to litigate the issues on the timetable set by the Court. There is thus no \"good cause\" for extending the Government's ability to do so. This Court should exclude any evidence the government seeks belatedly to offer pursuant to Rule 404(b), or, alternatively should the Court find good cause for the failure of notice, grant Ms. Maxwell additional time to respond. As far as admissibility of the evidence referenced in the Letter as \"direct evidence\" of the charged crimes, Ms. Maxwell seeks leave to file such a Motion within two weeks.\nDated: October 18, 2021\nRespectfully submitted,\ns/ Jeffrey S.
