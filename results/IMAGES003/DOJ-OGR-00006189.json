Previous research has found that two of the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were attention-seeking and revenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship partner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase, newly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage in behaviors that are viewed as \"manipulative.\" Manipulative behaviors are often outside the conscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as manipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual with BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some desired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder include: 1) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of attention; 2) interactions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallow expressions; 4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and 8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense desire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follow periods in which they received little attention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that may be used to seek attention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost attention, either from the desired partner or from other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a person who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of attention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the \"victim\" role that can be played out in other relationships (a dynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In times when attention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault may help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in cognition that cannot be better accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive doses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross impairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions that are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some cases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim adamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006189",
