It is not evidence. It is not proof of the defendant'sMs. Maxwell's guilt. It creates no presumption and it permits no inference that that the defendant is guilty. Ms. Maxwell begins trial with an absolutely clean slate and without any evidence against her. You must give no weight to the fact that an Indictment has been returned against the defendantMs. Maxwell.\n\nI will not read the entire Indictment to you at this time. Rather, I will first summarize the offenses charged in the Indictment and then explain in detail the elements of each of the offenses.\n\nAdapted from the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United States v. Jones, 16 Cr. 533 (AJN) and in United States v. Pizarro, 17 Cr. 151 (AJN).\n\n14\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006080",
