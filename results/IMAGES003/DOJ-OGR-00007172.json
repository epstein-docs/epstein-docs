But this is an issue -- and I will give the government the benefit of the doubt -- they do not know what we do when we have a conference with Ms. Maxwell so to assume what we are doing is erroneous. But, I will complete that topic and move on to another one. THE COURT: I want to understand the specific suggestion. So, presumably now, on a daily basis, the government may be meeting with witnesses and taking notes. I mean, I get those notes, an additional 3500 material during trial, it is one or two pages of chicken scratch, handwriting. So your proposal is that every day that one of those is produced it's hand delivered to the MDC by government staff? MS. STERNHEIM: That would be ideal but I'm not asking that and I don't think it comes that way, I think it comes more in these clumps. I'm not asking for every single page to be hand-delivered but if they know they are making a substantial production, that should be hand-delivered. THE COURT: And what do you mean by substantial? Over a hundred pages? What are we talking about? MS. STERNHEIM: Look. You know, it is not the quantity, it is what is in it that may have significance here. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, you have to be realistic on this. MS. STERNHEIM: I'm trying to be. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
