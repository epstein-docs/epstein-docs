Q. Are your professional presentations peer reviewed? A. Yes, they are. Q. What does it mean for a professional presentation to be peer reviewed? A. So it's the same peer-review process or it's analogous to the process I described for publication. In other words, people will submit, I would submit a presentation. There's a call for proposals. I would provide a proposal of what it is I would like to present to the program coordinator. They typically would have a team of individuals who then review all of the submissions and rate them. And then they would select those that they feel are most relevant and worthy and professional to present. Q. Focus on page 7 of Government Exhibit 1, have any of your professional presentations focused on trauma psychology or interpersonal violence? A. The vast majority of them have, yes. Q. Then turning to pages 7 and 8, have you given any invited addresses? A. I have. Q. What are invited addresses? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007201",
