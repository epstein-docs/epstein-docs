Today, November 15, Ms. Maxwell received disclosures from the government under cover letter dated November 6. This is an excessively long delay, especially since trial commences in two weeks. Please direct the government to send disclosures to Ms. Maxwell via Federal Express Next Day Delivery on the same day they are provided to counsel and to provide tracking information to counsel.\nYour assistance in resolving this persistent problem is greatly appreciated.\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.
