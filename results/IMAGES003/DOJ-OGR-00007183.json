And that will give additional time for the parties to confer after they have reviewed and a fewer number of questionnaires to review, given that we got there sooner. Any concerns with that, Ms. Pomerantz? MS. POMERANTZ: No. Thank you, your Honor. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim? MS. STERNHEIM: No. THE COURT: Great. Thank you. I did previously set a tentative hearing for November 15th, which is Monday, at 9:30. So that's firm. We'll have that hearing, to the extent we need to, to go over any pre voir dire process resolution of disputed questionnaires and the like if we need to, and talk about that process more. I'll also use it to address any outstanding motions in limine if I can. In particular I think I will then have full briefing, and hopefully be able to address defense motion 1, on co-conspirator statements; defense motion 4, regarding alleged victim 3; and defense motion 7, on Exhibit 52. If I'm able to, I'll also address the government's motions regarding exclusion of at least some testimony of Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
