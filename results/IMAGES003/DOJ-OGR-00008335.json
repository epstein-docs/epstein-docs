Just with respect to what you have as anticipated opinion about those subjects, when will you -- give me the date by which you'll tell me if your expert has different expert opinions to offer with respect to those areas. MS. MENNINGER: This Saturday, your Honor? THE COURT: All right. MS. MENNINGER: And I don't -- I guess what I'm hearing is, the only opinions he may offer are those disclosed in other cases. They haven't disclosed an opinion from this case. So we will look at those other trial testimony, and any opinions in those testimony that our client -- our expert disagrees with we can provide them by this Saturday.
