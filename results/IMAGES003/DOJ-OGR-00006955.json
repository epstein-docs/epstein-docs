R. Evid. 801(c) advisory committee's note. \"Thus, a statement offered to show its effect on the listener is not hearsay.\" United States v. Dupree, 706 F.3d 131, 136 (2d Cir. 2013); see also George v. Celotex Corp., 914 F.2d 26, 30 (2d Cir. 1990) (\"To be sure, an out of court statement offered not for the truth of the matter asserted, but merely to show that the defendant was on notice of a danger, is not hearsay.\")\nRule 801(d)(2)(E) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides in relevant part that \"[a] statement . . . is not hearsay [if] . . . [t]he statement is offered against an opposing party and . . . was made by the party's co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" To admit a statement under this rule, the Court must find two facts by a preponderance of the evidence: first, that a conspiracy that included the defendant and the declarant existed, and, second, that the statement was made during the course and in furtherance of that conspiracy. Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 175 (1987); United States v. Gigante, 166 F.3d 75, 82 (2d Cir. 1999). If those two prongs are satisfied, then the offered statement is admissible for the truth of the matter asserted.\nDOJ-OGR-00006955",
