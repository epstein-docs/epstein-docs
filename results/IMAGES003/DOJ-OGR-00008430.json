  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 554 Filed 12/18/21 Page 3 of 3\n\nGovernment would have to seek a Court order that materially alters public interests by jeopardizing—if not forgoing—any future criminal case against that individual.\n\nIn United States v. Jones, 17 Cr. 791 (LAK), Judge Kaplan rejected this defense argument on stronger facts for the defense. There, the defense sought to force the Government to immunize a defense witness. See Tr. 868-, id. (Dec. 11, 2019). The Court denied that request and subsequently instructed the jury that the parties “had the same opportunity or lack of opportunity to call witnesses.” Tr. 1310, id. (Dec. 16, 2019). Here, the defense at no point sought to immunize any particular witnesses. And although at the charge conference the defense identified one witness who the defense said had criminal exposure, it is evident that this case also involves numerous uncalled witnesses who were available for the defense to call, including Virginia Roberts. Particularly given the facts of this case, there is no basis to deviate from the standard instruction on the equal availability of witnesses.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Attorney\n\nBy: s/\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Attorneys\nSouthern District of New York\n\nCc: Defense Counsel (by ECF)",
