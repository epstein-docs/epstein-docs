I'm not going to preclude, but I do think this needs to play out at trial. I need to hear the witness testimony and I'll allow voir dire, given factually what I understood to be the issues surrounding this item, and as I understand it -- the witness is going to -- tell me if I have this wrong. The anticipated testimony, Ms. Comey -- this is for you, Ms. Comey -- the anticipated testimony is that not this exact book but a similar-looking book, characteristically similar, binding, pages, font, etc., was seen by this witness, and she can attempt to authenticate by describing the similarities between what is Government Exhibit 52 and what she saw. Is that the idea?\n\nMS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. Because this witness has not been informed about how that exhibit came into the government's possession, I just wanted to clarify one small thing, which is that this witness won't say that this isn't one thing, which is that -- you know, in particular, that because she recognizes it as one in a series, but doesn't know how it came to the government's possession, it's just identifying it in that way.\n\nTHE COURT: So your understanding is, by the time frame, this wouldn't have been the one that she saw, but she won't know that because you anticipate her testimony to be there were several versions of these and they are all the same.\n\nMS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00008326",
