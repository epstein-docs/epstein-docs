Mollo Building One Saint Andrew's Plaza New York, New York 10007 December 19, 2021 BY ECF The Honorable Alison J. Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: The parties respectfully submit this letter regarding the logistics for public access for closing arguments. The parties propose that they will release a public version of their slides (to the extent they do not contain sealed materials) following the conclusion of the trial day on the same basis that they have been releasing public exhibits during trial. This proposal appropriately balances the public interest in access to closing arguments with the Court and the parties' interests in avoiding delay and effective advocacy on behalf of their clients, as well as the interests of victims and third parties protected by the Court's sealing orders.1 Closing argument demonstratives are not part of the official trial record. The approach jointly proposed by the parties is consistent with trials conducted without electronics, where the public would not be in a position to see white boards or easel displays positioned facing the jury box.
