  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 565 Filed 12/19/21 Page 49 of 83\n1 I want to caution you, however, that Ms. Maxwell's mere presence at the scene of the alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the conspiracy. Similarly, a person may know, assemble with, or be friendly with, one or more members of a conspiracy, without being a conspirator herself. I also want to caution you that mere knowledge or acquiescence, without participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient. In other words, knowledge without agreement and participation is not sufficient. What is necessary is that Ms. Maxwell participate in the conspiracy with knowledge of its unlawful purposes, and with an intent to aid in the accomplishment of its unlawful objectives.\n2 It is also not necessary that Ms. Maxwell receive or even anticipate any financial benefit from participating in the conspiracy as long as she participated in it in the way I have explained.\n3 That said, while proof of a financial interest in the outcome of a scheme is not essential, if you find that Ms. Maxwell had such an interest, that is a factor which you may properly consider in determining whether or not she was a member of a conspiracy charged in the Indictment.\n4 Once a conspiracy is formed, it is presumed to continue until either its objective is accomplished or there is some affirmative act of termination by the members. So too, once a person is found to be a member of a conspiracy, she is presumed to continue as a member in the conspiracy until the conspiracy is terminated, unless it is shown by some affirmative proof that the person withdrew and disassociated herself from it.\n5 In sum, the defendant, with an understanding of the unlawful nature of the conspiracy, may have intentionally engaged, advised, or assisted in the conspiracy for the purpose of furthering an illegal undertaking. The defendant thereby becomes a knowing and willing participant in the unlawful agreement—that is to say, she becomes a conspirator.\n48\nDOJ-OGR-00008755",
