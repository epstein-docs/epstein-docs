(continued) Study Design Purpose/findings Sample Summary Ungar, Tutty, McComne , Barter, and Fa rhom (2009b) This study explored abuse disclosure strategies with a nonrepresentative sample of 1,099 Canadian youth who completed own victimization forms Red Cross RespectED programming between 2000 and 2003 was the focus of the study. One of the goals of the study was to document not only youth's experiences of abuse but also their attitudes towards abuse prevention programs: (1) What forms of abuse disclosure barriers do youth face? (2) What's their abuse disclosure patterns? (3) What are youth's experiences with abuse disclosure? (4) What are youth's interactions with peers, educators, and caregivers? About three-quarters of youth disclosed; significantly more youth disclosed to peers than to adults. About half disclosed to CSA survivors. Findings suggest disclosure is a process, with expectations shaped by young people's previous experiences of abuse. Patterns of incremental disclosure were reported. Innovative designs of this study provide insights into young people's perceptions of good disclosure experiences. High trustworthiness of the data was ensured through use of youth focus groups, interviews, and observation data. The study results are somewhat limited because most of the descriptions of abuse can offer because of the clinical nature of the data. Regional survey-based differences may not have been picked up. Scope and approach were broad and creative. 1,099 youth evaluated forms of abuse disclosure. Out of 1,099 participants, 225 males and 779 females indicated that they had been abused. Of those, 43 males and 180 females disclosed the abuse. Of those who disclosed, a portion of males and females reported that they had disclosed to \"When I was abused\" or \"When I was younger\". 5% were directed towards professionals and others, with fewer choosing parents/family, and others. Twenty-seven interviewers and focus groups were so done to understand contextual issues and engage youth program facilitators in the interpretation of findings. A coding structure was developed for analyses to synthesize themes across data sources.",
