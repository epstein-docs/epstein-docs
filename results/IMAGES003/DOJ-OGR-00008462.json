My duty at this point is to instruct you as to the law. It is your duty to\n5 accept these instructions of law and apply them to the facts as you determine them.\n6 On these legal matters, you must take the law as I give it to you. Regardless of any\n7 opinion that you may have as to what the law may be—or ought to be—it would violate your\n8 sworn duty to base a verdict upon any other view of the law than that which I give you. If an\n9 attorney or anyone else at trial has stated a legal principle different from any that I state to you in\n10 my instructions, it is my instructions that you must follow.\n11 You should not single out any instruction alone stating the law, but you should consider\n12 my instructions as a whole when you retire to deliberate in the jury room. You may take a copy\n13 of these instructions with you into the jury room.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-00008462",
