But, in determining\n9\nwhether the Defendant acted knowingly, you may also consider whether the Defendant\n10\ndeliberately closed her eyes to what otherwise would have been obvious.\n11\nTo be clear, the necessary knowledge on the part of the Defendant with respect to any\n12\nparticular charge cannot be established by showing that the Defendant was careless, negligent, or\n13\nfoolish. However, one may not willfully and intentionally remain ignorant of a fact material and\n14\nimportant to her conduct in order to escape the consequences of criminal law. The law calls this\n15\n“conscious avoidance” or “willful blindness.”\n16\nAn argument by the Government of conscious avoidance is not a substitute for proof; it is\n17\nsimply another factor that you, the jury, may consider in deciding what the Defendant knew.\n18\nThus, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant was aware that there was a high\n19\nprobability a crime was being committed, but that the Defendant deliberately and consciously\n20\navoided confirming this fact, such as by purposely closing her eyes to it or intentionally failing to\n21\ninvestigate it, then you may treat this deliberate avoidance of positive knowledge as the\n22\nequivalent of knowledge, unless you find that the Defendant actually believed that she was not\n23\nengaged in such unlawful behavior. In other words, a defendant cannot avoid criminal\n54\nDOJ-OGR-00008675",
