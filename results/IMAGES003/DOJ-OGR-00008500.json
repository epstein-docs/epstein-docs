The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here. Often,\n3 the only evidence that is available with respect to the existence of a conspiracy is that of\n4 disconnected acts and conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators. When taken\n5 altogether and considered as whole, however, these acts and conduct may warrant the inference\n6 that a conspiracy existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an express\n7 agreement.\n8 In short, as far as the first element of the conspiracy is concerned, the Government must\n9 prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at least two alleged conspirators came to a mutual\n10 understanding, either spoken or unspoken, to violate the law in the manner charged in Counts\n11 One, Three, and Five of the Indictment.\n43\nDOJ-OGR-00008500",
