Below, we address the applicable law, before turning to the specific relief the Government requests in this case.1\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nThe Confrontation Clause guarantees defendants the right to cross-examine witnesses who testify against them. See, e.g., United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2008). This right, however, is not absolute. A defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause must yield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id. For instance, trial courts have \"wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits . . . on . . . cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, . . . or the witness's safety.\" United States v. Al Farekh, 810 F. App'x 21, 25 (2d Cir. 2020) (summary order).\n\n1 Simultaneously with the filing of this motion, the Government is filing a sealed letter providing the names of the Minor Victims and witnesses identified in this section, along with certain other personal information. The Government requests that the defense omit identifying information from its response brief or permit the Government an opportunity to seek necessary redactions or sealing.\n\n4\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006365",
