Those conspiracies operated through a pattern of recruiting minor girls, grooming them, asking them to massage Epstein, and then sexualizing the massages, from 1994 to 2004, across Epstein and the defendant's various properties. (See 11/05/21 Gov't Letter at 5-6, 9). It was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant that she and Epstein's efforts to recruit the girls to whom Epstein was sexually attracted would include recruiting a seventeen-year-old—Minor Victim-3—in the course of that conspiracy. And but for that recruitment, Minor Victim-3 would not have been harmed. See United States v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 561, 570 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (\"The definition of victim under the CVRA is expansive. It is not limited to those, such as Jane Doe-1 and Jane Doe-2 who allegedly were victims of physical abuse.\"); cf., e.g., United States v.
