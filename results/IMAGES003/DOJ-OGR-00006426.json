The issues raised under headings II-XI should be denied on this basis alone. The arguments related to the use of pseudonyms and other artifices fails because the limitations suggested by the government will: (1) unconstitutionally restrict Ms. Maxwell's confrontation rights; (2) run afoul of both her right to a public trial and the First Amendment right to public access, and (3) are simply unworkable as a practical matter inviting a mistrial.\n\nA. The True Purpose of a Motion in Limine\n\nThe purpose of a motion in limine is to allow the trial court to rule in advance of trial on the admissibility of certain forecasted evidence. See Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 40 n. 2 (1984) (explaining that the motion in limine is used to \"to exclude anticipated prejudicial evidence before the evidence is actually offered\"); see also Palmieri v. Defaria et al., 88 F.3d 136, 141 (2d Cir. 1996) (\"The purpose of an in limine motion is to aid the trial process by enabling the Court to rule in advance of trial on the relevance of certain forecasted evidence, as\n\n1\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006426",
