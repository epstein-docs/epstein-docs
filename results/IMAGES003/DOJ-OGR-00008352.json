Why don't you both look at it, confer,\n2 see if you can come to agreement, and if not, put in a letter.\n3 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.\n4 THE COURT: Thank you.\n5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, one other issue on sequestration. I was hoping to be able to provide a copy of\n6 Dr. Rocchio's testimony to either Dr. Dietz or Dr. Loftus, because I anticipate there may be issues that come up that they\n7 need to address during their testimony. And so for that purpose I would ask for a limited exclusion from Rule 615 for\n8 those witnesses.\n9 MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine with the government, your Honor.\n10 THE COURT: Thank you. This is why I asked. Make sure we're on the same page.\n11 Anything else in that regard?\n12 MS. COMEY: Not from the government, your Honor.\n13 THE COURT: When may I have an order-of-witness list?\n14 MS. COMEY: We would propose by Saturday, your Honor?\n15 THE COURT: OK. And, as I always do, I ask at the final pretrial conference if any plea offers were communicated\n16 to the defense.\n17 MS. COMEY: None were communicated, your Honor.\n18 THE COURT: And Ms. Sternheim, that's accurate; none were communicated?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00008352",
