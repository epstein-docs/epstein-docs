Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this letter regarding the jury charge. We did not notice any errors in the Court's redline of the draft jury charge or the draft verdict sheet. We note that at the charge conference, the Court reserved decision on whether to slightly modify the language of Instruction No. 50: \"Uncalled Witnesses - Equally Available to Both Sides\" to take the emphasis off the word \"equal.\" Tr. 2815:14 - 2817:16. We assume the Court has decided not to make those proposed edits. If that is incorrect, we renew our request for those edits.\n\nWe have also reviewed the government's letter regarding the jury charge (Dkt. 556). We do not object to the government's proposed edit to Instruction No. 19.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n/s/\nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM\n\ncc: Counsel of record\n\nDOJ-OGR-00008438",
