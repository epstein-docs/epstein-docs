MENNINGER: Your Honor, even the statement \"a non-testifying victim\" is very loaded because who is going to testify that that person is a victim and on what ground? That's the problem.\nTHE COURT: Well, I wouldn't allow testimony by a witness about a characterization that goes to a legal issue so of course they could testify about observations involving other people. I can imagine instances in which they testify about statements of others not offered for the truth but I wouldn't anticipate the government would attempt to do any of that via any characterization of those individuals that go to legal conclusions relevant to the jury's role.\nDo I have that right, Ms. Moe?\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\nMS. MENNINGER: It is interesting, because in their offer of proof they actually say that one witness is going to talk about another person being a victim of sexual abuse and that second person isn't going to testify, and the question of whether that person was a victim of sexual abuse would turn on the age at which they were conducting certain activities.
