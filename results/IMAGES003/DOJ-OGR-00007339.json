Nathan\nUnited States Circuit Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, NY 10007\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write to inform the Court of the recurring problem regarding late delivery of mail by the government to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC. Today, November 15, Ms. Maxwell received disclosures from the government under cover letter dated November 6. This is an excessively long delay, especially since trial commences in two weeks. Please direct the government to send disclosures to Ms. Maxwell via Federal Express Next Day Delivery on the same day they are provided to counsel and to provide tracking information to counsel.\n\nYour assistance in resolving this persistent problem is greatly appreciated.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n/s/\nBOBBI C. STERNHEIM\n\ncc: All counsel of record\n\nIt appears that the mail referenced in this letter was sent prior to the Court's memo endorsement of the Government's November 8, 2021 letter. Dkt. Nos. 422, 425. In any event, as this matter is less than two weeks before trial, the Government is ordered to send materials via FedEx and provide the tracking number to defense counsel. SO ORDERED.\n\nAlison J. Nathan\n11/15/21\n\nDOJ-OGR-00007339",
