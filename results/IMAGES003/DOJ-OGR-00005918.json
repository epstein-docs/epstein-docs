(continued) Study Alaggia (2010) Fontes and Pummer (2010) Ungar, Barter, McConnech, Tutty, and Fathom. (2009a) Summary Findings Themes Sample Design Purpose The study presents a comprehensive socio-ecological analysis of CSA disclosure. Of note, 42% had disclosed the abuse during childhood; 26% had not disclosed because they had repressed the memory of the abuse; and the remainder had attempted some form of disclosure, but it was not successful. A retrospective approach that could be affected by recall issues. One of the few works that adds knowledge to cultural contextual factors affecting CSA disclosure. Uniquely combines findings with an in-depth study of CSA disclosure. Recommendations made to (1) disclose CSA details; (2) question cultural competency; and (3) culture stands as an important factor in disclosure, not so much in CSA cases which are not so different. Youths' experiences of CSA disclosure were examined in a national sample of 1621 youths. Evaluation forms were completed by youth owing to participation in abuse prevention programs.",
