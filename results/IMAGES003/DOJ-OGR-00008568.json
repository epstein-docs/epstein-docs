The phrase, \"transport an individual in interstate or foreign commerce\" means to move or carry, or cause someone to be moved or carried, from one state to another or between the United States and a foreign country.\n9 The Government does not have to prove that Ms. Maxwell personally transported Jane across a state line. It is sufficient to satisfy this element that Ms. Maxwell was actively engaged, either personally or through an agent, in the making of the travel arrangements, such as by purchasing tickets necessary for Jane to travel as planned.\n13 Ms. Maxwell must have knowingly transported, or caused the transportation of, Jane in interstate commerce. This means that the Government must prove that Ms. Maxwell knew both that she was causing Jane to be transported, and that Jane was being transported in interstate commerce. As I have explained, an act is done knowingly when it is done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of accident, mistake or some innocent reason.\n18 It is the Defendant's intent that matters here. If the Government establishes each of the elements of this crime beyond a reasonable doubt, then the Defendant is guilty of this charge whether or not the individual agreed or consented to cross state lines.\n29\nDOJ-OGR-00008568",
