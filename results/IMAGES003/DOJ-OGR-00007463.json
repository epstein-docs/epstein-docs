They are not being rude — they are\n4 simply following my instructions.\n5\n6 Conclusion\n7 That concludes my preliminary instructions to you. Now we will begin with\n8 the initial stage of the case, which, as I said to you, is opening statements, and we\n9 are going to begin with the government.\n10 Let me just note, as I said in the beginning of jury selection, we are in an\n11 outfitted courtroom for COVID times. The witness will be in this Plexiglass box\n12 that has a HEPA filter, and they will remove their mask to testify when we have\n13 witnesses testify. The lawyer who will be questioning them and the lawyer during\n14 opening statements will be in that Plexiglass box with the HEPA filter, and they\n15 will be permitted to remove their mask while they provide opening statements, as\n16 well.\n17 So at this time I am going to ask all of you to give your undivided attention\n18 to the lawyers as they make their opening statements.\n10\nDOJ-OGR-00007463",
