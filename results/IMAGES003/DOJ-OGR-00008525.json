One or more of the attorneys has referred to their absence from the trial. I instruct you\n4 that each party had an equal opportunity or lack of opportunity to call any of these witnesses.\n5 Therefore, you should not draw any inferences or reach any conclusions as to what they would\n6 have testified to had they been called. Their absence should not affect your judgment in any way.\n7 You should remember my instruction, however, that the law does not impose on the\n8 defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any\n9 evidence.\n68\nDOJ-OGR-00008525",
