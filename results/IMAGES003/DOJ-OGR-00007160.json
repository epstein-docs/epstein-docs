THE COURT: I do think once we do that, the non-struck jurors, with that information, can then be excused for the day and returning on -- and obviously I haven't indicated yet -- the 19th or the 29th, those instructions. But they don't need to sit around for the rest of the day while we do the other individuals. Any objections to that process, Ms. Moe? MS. MOE: No. Thank you. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim? MS. STERNHEIM: No, thank you. THE COURT: There are logistical issues we are dealing with for bringing the full panel back for the exercised peremptories as well as setting up the courtroom with distancing issues which turns, to some extent, on the vaccine status of the individuals because we have different spacing requirements under the current protocols for the vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Now, the parties have proposed that I ask that question in voir dire and I rejected that because I don't think there is any proper basis for striking based on vaccination status. But what I would propose, in order to facilitate the Court's logistical process which is complicated, is that for our non-struck jurors, as we give them the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
