Commented [CE17]: The defense objects to beginning out of order with the substantive counts and grouping the conspiracy counts later The defense submits that the instructions for the counts should proceed in order, as they are charged in the Indictment, and each count should be separately addressed. Commented [RA(18R17]: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE: The Government submits that it will be clearer for the jury to avoid repetition to explain the substantive crimes, and then incorporate that explanation for the conspiracy offenses Commented [CE19]: The defense objects to the inclusion of the term \"coerces\" if the proof at trial does not include evidence of the use of force of other coercion Commented [RA(20R19]: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE: The term \"coerce\" carries its ordinary meaning. see United States v. Wagar, 997 F 3d 481, 485 (2d Cir 2021) (regarding ยง 2422(b)), and the ordinary meaning of \"coerce\" need not involve force. See \"Coerce,\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary (defining \"coerce\" as \"to compel to an act or choice\") The Government expects that its proof will include evidence of coercion, and in any event, this verb is in the statutory language DOJ-OGR-00006084",
