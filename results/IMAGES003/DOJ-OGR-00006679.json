The photographic identification procedure used was the functional equivalent of a one-on-one show-up. Any identification is tainted and should therefore be suppressed by the Court. ARGUMENT A defendant's right to due process includes the right not to be the object of suggestive police identification procedures that create \"a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\" Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968); accord Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972); see also Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 106 n.9, 114 (1977). This principle applies both to show-ups, see, e.g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (1967), and to photographic identifications. Simmons v.
