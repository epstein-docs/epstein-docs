  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 Filed 11/08/21 Page 27 of 41\n\nDr. Dietz's opinion that individuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than individuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and that these disorders can affect memory and recall, is prejudicial and unhelpful. Offering this opinion in this form can only serve to prejudice the jury into making generalizations that certain witnesses, as a category, are more likely to be less worthy of belief by reason of mental illness. Given that Dr. Dietz acknowledges that witness credibility should be assessed on a \"case-by-case basis\" (Ex. A at 11), that case-by-case assessment is best made by precluding him from offering this prejudicial and stereotyping opinion before the jury.\n\n6. Opinions Regarding Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms\n\nFinally, Dr. Dietz opines that \"significant proportions\" of victims exhibit post-traumatic stress symptomology for \"varying durations\" and that victims with certain symptoms are \"particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or friendly gestures with an alleged perpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator, or to unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event.\" (Ex. A at 11).\n\nThis opinion is confusing and appears not to be relevant to the facts of the case. First, Dr. Dietz's conclusion that victims with certain post-traumatic stress symptoms are unlikely to \"unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event\" is illogical given that it appears to place the responsibility on the victim for experiencing repeated assaults, and at a minimum he should be required to disclose comprehensibly exactly what behavior he is referring to as unlikely.\n\nSecond, a critical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual assaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of attachment and coercion with their abusers—including the power imbalance arising from the age differential between them and the abusers—and those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz's testimony primarily addresses the latter category, 23\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006238",
