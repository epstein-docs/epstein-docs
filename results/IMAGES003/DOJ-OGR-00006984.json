As an example, I have conferred with Judge Donnelly, who\n9 went through similar voir dire questioning recently in the\n10 Eastern District, and there was public access to the individual\n11 questioning, and I think all of that was managed in a way that\n12 everybody felt comfortable with.\n13 I think we start with, as the law requires, as the\n14 First Amendment requires and case law requires, the presumption\n15 of public access. I will take into account, as need be, any\n16 specific requests for deviation in a tailored and narrow way to\n17 ensure juror candor, protection of privacy, and the like.\n18 That's my overall approach. I don't think we need to\n19 deal with it in any broader way now, but tell me if you\n20 disagree.\n21 MS. STERNHEIM: I do not agree. We do not need to\n22 deal with it now. I just wanted to express our concerns on\n23 that issue.\n24 THE COURT: OK. Anything else, Ms. Sternheim?\n25 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes. Just a moment, please?\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300",
