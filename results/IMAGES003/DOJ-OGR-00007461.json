If any person should attempt to communicate with you\n3 about this case at any time throughout the trial, either in or out of the courthouse,\n4 you must immediately report that to my Deputy, Ms. Williams, and to no one else.\n5 Ms. Williams will report it to me. When I say report that communication to no one\n6 else, I mean that you should not tell anyone, including your fellow jurors.\n7 To minimize the probability of any such improper communication, it is\n8 important that you go straight to the jury room when you come in in the morning\n9 and that you remain in the jury room for the duration of the trial day. You should\n10 not linger in the public areas of the courthouse, on this floor or elsewhere on your\n11 way in and out.\n12 Fourth, do not do any research or any investigation about the case or about\n13 anyone who has anything to with the case on your own. Don't go visit any place\n14 described in the trial. Don't read or listen to or watch any news reports about the\n15 case. Don't go on the internet or use whatever digital or communications device it\n16 is you use to see what you can learn to inform yourself about this matter.\n17 Again, I know that in this day and age, there is temptation, but as I have\n18 made clear throughout the process so far, this rule is very very important. That is\n19 because your decision in this case must be made solely on the evidence or lack of\n20 evidence presented at the trial.
