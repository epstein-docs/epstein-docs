According to the government, \"all that is required\" for evidence to be admissible as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies is that she was under the age of 18, the age of consent under U.S. federal law, and that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein intended to engage in sexual contact with her. See id. It is the government, not the defense, that apparently does not understand the law. The Mann Act conspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment each require proof that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the alleged victim would \"engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.\" S2 Ind. ¶¶ 12 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 2422), 18 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a)).

Penal Law § 130.55). Section 130.55 prohibits \"subject[ing] another person to sexual contact without the latter's consent.\" N.Y. Penal Law § 130.55. To be guilty of Section 130.55 based on the victim's incapacity to consent due to age, the victim must be under the age of 17. Id. § 130.05(3)(a). The government itself acknowledged this in its draft proposed jury instructions, as well as the fact that Ms. Maxwell cannot be convicted of the Mann Act conspiracies unless she knew that the alleged victim was under 17.
