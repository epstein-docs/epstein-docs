My chambers sent the parties just so you had an opportunity to review them before today, a list of 13 additional prospective jurors that were on the parties' agreed to proceed to voir dire list, that when I looked at, thought should be considered for excusing and I had 13 juror numbers on that list. I understand the government didn't object to striking those prospective jurors, but the defense objected to striking four of them. So from my perspective, we'll keep those four on the list for whom the parties agree should proceed to voir dire.
