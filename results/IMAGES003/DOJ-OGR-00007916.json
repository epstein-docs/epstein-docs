  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 499-2 Filed 11/23/21 Page 48 of 15947 LBAGmax2 Rocchio - Direct trauma bonding is typically referring to a relationship of attachment and connection between the pimp and the sex worker. We know that the majority of sex workers are under some third-party control. And we know that the trauma bonding is often the means by which the pimp has coerced the sex worker to get them to do their bidding, similar to the kinds of techniques that traffickers might use. So there's a significant amount of overlap. And there has been actually some recent research -- this is one example -- but others have specifically looked at grooming as it applies to trafficking, for example. THE COURT: Thank you. BY MS. POMERANTZ: Q. Dr. Rocchio -- withdrawn. MS. POMERANTZ: Can we pull up Government Exhibit 3, please. BY MS. POMERANTZ: Q. Dr. Rocchio, do you recognize this? A. I do. Q. What is it? A. It's an article validating a model of child sexual abusers. Q. Who wrote this? A. Georgia Winters, Elizabeth Jeglic and Leah Kaylor. MS. POMERANTZ: The government offers Government Exhibit 3.
