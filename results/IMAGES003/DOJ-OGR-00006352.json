As discussed, the jury may extrapolate from the opinions that the presence of a third party creates the atmosphere of trust that can facilitate grooming. Moreover, as the Government explains, Dr. Rocchio's testimony is still relevant because the Government alleges both that Ms. Maxwell \"in fact participated in sexual abuse of minors\" and that she \"conspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors.\" Dkt. No. 397 at 27.\n\nThe Court therefore denies the Defense's motion to exclude Dr. Rocchio's testimony except as to the opinion that the presence of a third party can facilitate grooming.\n\nThis resolves docket number 386.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDated: November 11, 2021\nNew York, New York\n\nALISON J.
