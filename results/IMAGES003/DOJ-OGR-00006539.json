Because the grounds for admission will depend on the defense's precise challenge to the witness, the Government will raise this issue with the Court before eliciting prior consistent statements from its witnesses.\n\nIII.

Several of the Government's motions are aimed at preventing the defense from surprising the Court and the Government with irrelevant, inflammatory, and highly prejudicial arguments.\n\nThe defense response makes clear that they intend to put before the jury the history of the various Epstein investigations in other jurisdictions and the outcomes of those matters.
