For instance, and as noted above, Minor Victim-4 is expected to testify that she was recruited by Minor Victim-5. Those statements are not offered for their truth, but to explain Minor Victim-4's actions. Similarly, Minor Victim-4 is expected to testify that she personally observed the sexual abuse of Minor Victim-5—observations that require no hearsay statements from Minor Victim-5.
