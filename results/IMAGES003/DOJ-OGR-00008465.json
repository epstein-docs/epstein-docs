The lawyers' arguments are intended to convince you to draw\n6\ncertain conclusions from the evidence or lack of evidence. Those arguments are important. You\n7\nshould weigh and evaluate them carefully. But you must not confuse them with the evidence. If\n8\nyour recollection of the evidence differs from the statements of the lawyers, follow your\n9\nrecollection.\n10\nYou should draw no inference or conclusion for or against any party by reason of lawyers\n11\nmaking objections or my rulings on such objections. Counsel have not only the right but the duty\n12\nto make legal objections that they think are appropriate. You should not be swayed against the\n13\nGovernment or the Defendant simply because counsel for either side has chosen to make an\n14\nobjection. Similarly, statements made by counsel when arguing the admissibility of evidence are\n15\nnot to be considered as evidence.\n16\nIf I comment on the evidence during my instructions, do not accept my statements in\n17\nplace of your recollection. Again, it is your recollection that governs.\n18\nDo not concern yourself with what was said at side bar conferences or during my\n19\ndiscussions with counsel. Those discussions related to rulings of law, which are my duty, and not\n20\nto matters of fact, which are your duty to determine.\n21\nAt times I may have admonished a witness or directed a witness to be responsive to\n22\nquestions, to keep his or her voice up, or to repeat an answer. My instructions were intended only\n23\nto clarify the presentation of evidence. You should draw no inference or conclusion of any kind,\n24\nfavorable or unfavorable, with respect to any witness or party in the case, by reason of any\n8\nDOJ-OGR-00008465",
