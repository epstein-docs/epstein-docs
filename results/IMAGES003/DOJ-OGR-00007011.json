We wouldn't be able to accommodate in-person presence for that purpose. I don't think it would be necessary, so my suggestion is not to have the parties present for the filling out of the questionnaire.\nDo you disagree with that in any way, Ms. Sternheim?\nMS. STERNHEIM: No, Judge. I just wanted a clarification, because I have attended when judges have given those preliminary instructions. But we have no objection to the Court doing it in a recorded method.\nTHE COURT: OK.\nMs. Pomerantz, do you continue to be comfortable with that?\nMS. POMERANTZ: Yes. Thank you, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: All right. I will docket an anticipated script soon to get your input in a letter with any requests for changes, and then I will get that recorded and work with the tech folks in the D.E.'S Office and the jury department to be able to have that played before the questionnaire is filled out.\nThat's what I have, counsel. Are there other matters to raise related to jury selection or otherwise at this time?\nMs. Pomerantz.\nMS. POMERANTZ: Not from the government. Thank you,\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
