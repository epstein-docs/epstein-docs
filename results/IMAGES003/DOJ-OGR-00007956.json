Q. How common is delayed disclosure in the patients you treat and evaluate in connection with your clinical practice? A. It's very common. The majority of the patients that I work with who've -- who've experienced childhood sexual abuse, like all victims of child sexual abuse, the abuses, a majority that has occur, most likely will occur in the context of a relationship. And we know that the closer the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, the more delayed the disclosure is. So I would say that it's -- it's certainly not rare but it's not common necessarily that I am always the first person that the individual has told, but it's definitely more common than not that they did not tell someone at the time that it was occurring, that they told at some point significantly later in time. Q. When patients have disclosed that they experienced childhood sexual abuse to you for the first time, were your patients adults or children? A. I would say that when they're making an initial disclosure for the first time, they have been adults, although, when I was working in an inpatient setting at times I, I certainly worked with adolescents who had made disclosure while they were still SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
