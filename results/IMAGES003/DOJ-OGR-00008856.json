Sealing is warranted to protect a defendant's fair trial rights if the Court makes specific findings that \"first, there is a substantial probability that the defendant's right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that [sealing] would prevent, and, second, reasonable alternatives to [sealing] cannot adequately protect the defendant's fair trial rights.

Ms. Maxwell's fair trial rights must be protected post-trial just as vigorously as they are pre-trial. To do that, it is necessary to keep the Motion temporarily sealed.\n2087306.1\nDOJ-OGR-00008856",
