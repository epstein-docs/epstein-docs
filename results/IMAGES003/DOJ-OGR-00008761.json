But, in determining\n14 whether the Defendant acted knowingly, you may also consider whether the Defendant\n15 deliberately closed her eyes to what otherwise would have been obvious.\n16\n17 To be clear, the necessary knowledge on the part of the Defendant with respect to any\n18 particular charge cannot be established by showing that the Defendant was careless, negligent, or\n19 foolish. However, one may not willfully and intentionally remain ignorant of a fact material and\n20 important to her conduct in order to escape the consequences of criminal law. The law calls this\n21 \"conscious avoidance\" or \"willful blindness.\"\n22\n23 An argument by the Government of conscious avoidance is not a substitute for proof; it is\n24 simply another factor that you, the jury, may consider in deciding what the Defendant knew.\n25\n26 Thus, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant was aware that there was a high\n27 probability a crime was being committed, but that the Defendant deliberately and consciously\n28 avoided confirming this fact, such as by purposely closing her eyes to it or intentionally failing to\n29 investigate it, then you may treat this deliberate avoidance of positive knowledge as the\n30 equivalent of knowledge, unless you find that the Defendant actually believed that she was not\n31 engaged in such unlawful behavior. In other words, a defendant cannot avoid criminal\n32\n54\nDOJ-OGR-00008761",
