NATHAN, District Judge:\nThe Court is in receipt of the Government's proposed redactions to the parties' supplemental briefing and the Court's Memorandum Opinion & Order regarding the admissibility of the anticipated testimony of Witness-3. Dkt. No. 481; see also Dkt. No. 477.\nThe Court concludes that the proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006) and narrowly tailored to protect the pre-trial privacy interests of an anticipated witness who is subject to this Court's pseudonym order. The redactions also properly protect materials related to the Rule 412 motion, which must remain sealed pursuant Rule 412. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(2); see also Advisory Committee Note—1994 Amendment.\nAccordingly, the parties are ORDERED to file the redacted papers on the public docket by November 22, 2021, including the Government's supplemental letter regarding Witness-3 dated November 7, 2021 in response to Dkt.
