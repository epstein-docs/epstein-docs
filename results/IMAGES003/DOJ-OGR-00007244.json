Can you explain. A. So, again, I'll use an example in the civil arena. If I'm asked, as part of my forensic evaluation, to opine about the impact of an alleged event, say childhood sexual abuse, and the degree to which a person's current difficulties are related to that event, I have to take prior vulnerability into account, because part of what I'm looking at is, how can I determine which of these persons' current difficulties are related to the sexual abuse or maybe related to other things that have happened in their past. So we know, because of the vulnerability literature, that if somebody is being abused in adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to have a history of earlier childhood sexual abuse. So I have to look at the interaction of those prior vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities both may have made the individual more vulnerable to the grooming behavior and to the subsequent sexual abuse, and also ways in which those prior vulnerabilities may have interacted with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for the individual I'm evaluating. Q. How does what you have observed in your forensic practice compare to your clinical practice with respect to individuals in higher-risk groups? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
