You, the\n\n3\n\nmembers of the jury, are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts. You pass upon the weight of\n\n4\n\nthe evidence or lack of evidence; you determine the credibility of the witnesses; you resolve such\n\n5\n\nconflicts as there may be in the testimony; and you draw whatever reasonable inferences you\n\n6\n\ndecide to draw solely based on the evidence and from the facts as you have determined them.\n\n7\n\nYou must determine the facts based solely on the evidence received in this trial.\n\n8\n\nIn determining the facts, you must rely upon your own recollections of the evidence.\n\n9\n\nWhat the lawyers have said—for instance, in opening statements, in closing arguments, in\n\n10\n\nobjections, or in questions—is not evidence. You should bear in mind particularly that questions\n\n11\n\nput to witnesses, although they can provide the context to answers, are not themselves evidence.\n\n12\n\nIt is only the answers that are evidence.\n\n13\n\nI remind you also that nothing I have said during the trial or will say during these\n\n14\n\ninstructions is evidence. Similarly, the rulings I have made during the trial are not any indication\n\n15\n\nof my views of what your decision should be.\n\n16\n\nThe evidence before you consists of the answers given by witnesses and the exhibits and\n\n17\n\nstipulations that were received into evidence. If I have sustained an objection to a question or\n\n18\n\ntold you to disregard testimony, the answers given by a witness are no longer part of the\n\n19\n\nevidence and may not be considered by you. I will instruct you at the end of these charges about\n\n20\n\nyour ability to request to have testimony read back and your access to other evidence admitted\n\n21\n\nduring the trial.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-00008713",
