And, in my mind, this witness is in a very different position than witness 3. 14 15 MR. EVERDELL: Yes. 16 17 THE COURT: But it's certainly relevant evidence to the enticement charge with respect to New York law. There's no doubt about that. 19 20 But I agree, we have to make sure that the jury understands, though it can be relevant evidence for that, if they want to take it into account for whatever they want to take it into account for, what they can't take it into account for is itself the New Mexico activity -- sexual activity as itself illegal conduct charged in the indictment. 24 25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
