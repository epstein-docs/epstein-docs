MOE: I understand the Court's concern and we certainly don't anticipate eliciting testimony about the victim's conclusions about the event or suggesting that it was unlawful or satisfied certain elements. My point was simply in describing it, which would be difficult for Minor Victim-3, that sort of her feelings about that or the circumstances that -- in narrating the facts of the event would I think come to light at trial, but we certainly don't intend to elicit testimony about conclusions, about things like consent or whether it was lawful, and particularly in light of the Court's ruling, and in any event, we wouldn't be seeking to proffer legal conclusions from a witness.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. Anything further on that, counsel?\n\nMS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.\n\nMR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor, thank you.\n\nTHE COURT: Defendant's 5 I think we determined is a non-issue. This goes to evidence that the defense was concerned in the government presenting regarding flight, and the government has represented that it will not offer evidence as to flight. Is that correct, Ms. Moe?\n\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: Anything else we need to address here?\n\nMR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
