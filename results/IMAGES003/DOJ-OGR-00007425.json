Graham, No. 14 Cr. 500 (NSR), 2015 WL 6161292, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 2015) (quoting United States v. Caputo, 808 F.2d 963, 968 (2d Cir. 1987)). The defendant is likely to argue that any steps taken to arrange massages were purely innocent conduct. See id.

Evidence of the defendant’s knowledge that massages were sexualized and the defendant’s motives described above is probative of her intent to entice and transport minors for the purpose of sexual contact. Minor Victim-3’s sexualized massages began around the time the conspiracy started, yet the massages continued—with the defendant’s active involvement, as to Minor Victim-3 and other Minor Victims—for years. That is highly probative evidence of her intent as to each of the conspiracies charged in the Indictment. And Minor Victim-3’s testimony contains additional evidence of the defendant’s intent.
