(continued) Study Purpose Design Sample questionnaire for childhood abuse characteristics and the disclosure. Child disclosure, perception of response and fear of negative consequences probed. Correlate analyses were conducted with path analyses to test the hypothesized causal relations among variables. The study focus was to gather data from a large sample of women about the length of time to disclosure. Structured telephone interviews were conducted with approximately 2,009 women who reported being sexually assaulted before age 18 and who were randomly selected from a sample of 2,009 respondents. A computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system was used to conduct the interviews. Random digit dialing (RDD) was used to select the sample. The survey consisted of several measures designed to assess the disclosure of child sexual abuse and its consequences. The present study reports on data from the demographic and disclosure variables. Two probability samples, Wave 1 and Wave 2, were selected from the 1989 and 1995 National Crime Victimization Surveys (NCVS). The average age at the time of the first rape was 10.9 years. Of the 288 women who reported being sexually assaulted, 28% stated that they had told no one about the assault at the time it occurred. The time frame of this survey may have had contextual influences on the major types of events reported in the sample. The average number of sexual assaults (including CSA) reported was 2.09. Anyone queried by the interviewer was considered to be a disclosure. Approximately 47% of women between 18 and 34 years old reported being sexually assaulted. Fewer than 10% of victims reported making a report to law enforcement personnel. On average, 12% of child rape victims stated that they had reported the assault to someone. The time frame of this survey may have influenced the major types of events reported in the sample. The average number of sexual assaults (including CSA) reported was 2.09. Anyone queried by the interviewer was considered to be a disclosure. Summary negative consequences to disclosure took longer to disclose. We designed a study with a high level of rigor. Produced a valuable mode of disclosure for further investigation. Researchers were not able to interview children. However, perceptions were not able to be determined. Findings negative consequences to disclosure took longer to disclose. Children who brought harm to others took longer to disclose. Fear of negative consequences to disclosure took longer to disclose. Approximately 47% of women between 18 and 34 years old reported being sexually assaulted. Smith, LeTourneau, Saunders, K. Patrick, Resnick and Best (2000) Note.
