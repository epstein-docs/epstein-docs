(continued) Study Purpose CSA victims when they disclose the abuse and (2) identify factors associated with different patterns of disclosure Findings Sample: 123 boys; average age of victims was 9.7 years. 47% were made with 72 hrs of disclosure, 31% from 72 hrs to 1 month and 22% more than a month after the abuse Design: Cases referred during the period of January 2001 to December 2003 Summary Findings: (1) purposeful disclosure (30% of cases) and (2) incorrect disclosure (18% of cases) and (3) eyewitness detection (43% of cases) independently predicted by victims age, frequency of abuse and reporting latency. Mean age of purposeful disclosure (10.67) was higher than the mean age of non-purposeful disclosure (9.84). Expert forms of disclosure were more likely when the reporter was a family member. Shorter reporting latency was more common among the 26,446 children aged 3- to 14-years-old. Overall, 65% of the 26,446 children reported sexual abuse and 71% reported physical abuse. Rates of disclosure were greater for sexual abuse (6%) than for physical abuse (5%). Children aged 3- to 5-years-old grew at a slower rate than children aged 6- to 12-years-old. Disclosure rates increased from 1998 to 2002, and experienced interviewers conducted standardized NICHD protocol. Archive data were analyzed Hershkowitz, Horowitz, and Lamb (2005) This study aimed to identify characteristics of suspected child abuse victims that are associated with disclosure during nondisclosure interviews The study investigated 20 families with a total of 22 children who were able to participate in the context in which they reported sexual abuse experiences; the children were able to talk about what happened to them. What the parents and the children's perceptions of the disclosure process were The study used a qualitative approach to collect data on 20 families with a total of 22 children who were able to participate in the context in which they reported sexual abuse experiences; the children were able to talk about what happened to them.
