The terms \"persuaded,\" \"induced,\" \"enticed,\" and \"coerced\" have their ordinary, everyday meanings.\n4\n5\n6\n7 The term \"interstate commerce\" simply means movement from one state to another. The term \"State\" includes a State of the United States and the District of Columbia.\n8\n9 \"Knowingly\" Defined\n10\n11 Ms. Maxwell must have acted knowingly. An act is done knowingly when it is done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of accident, mistake, or some other innocent reason.\n12\n13 Now, knowledge is a matter of inference from the proven facts. Science has not yet devised a manner of looking into a person's mind and knowing what that person is thinking.\n14\n15 Whether Ms. Maxwell acted knowingly may be proven by Ms. Maxwell's conduct and by all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.\n21\nDOJ-OGR-00008728",
