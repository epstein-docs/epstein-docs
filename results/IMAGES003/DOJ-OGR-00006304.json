  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424-4 Filed 11/08/21 Page 7 of 33 Dietz 33 Cioffi (1976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer only to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing \". . . he duly reported that he had discovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual experience before puberty. In other words, a seduction\" (p. 275). Cioffi's (1976) quotations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: \"Freud later assigned to his patients in phrases like: 'hysterics trace back their symptoms to fictitious traumas'—or patients 'ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual experiences in early childhood'\" (p. 277). Even here, however, what constitutes a \"passive sexual experience\" is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use violence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active participant. Archaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer A second archaic usage of \"seduction\" is to refer to the child's tempting of the offender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual abuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples: \"... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distinguished as unusually charming and attractive in their outward personalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the possibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather than the one innocently seduced\" (Bender & Blau, 1937, p. 514). \"The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims are usually known to be aggressive and seductive children\" (Revitch & Weiss, 1962, p. 78). \"In many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his charm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent one who had been seduced . . .\" (Bender & Grunett, 1952, p. 826). \"Abraham (1907) and Bender and Blau (1937) have commented on how charming and seductive these children can be\" (Rosenfeld, Nadelson, Krieger, & Backman, 1977, p. 332). Three examples of authors attempting to remedy this archaic view are as follows: \"... Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an attack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have full adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be viewed as responsible in this area\" (Lipton & Roth, 1969, p. 859).
