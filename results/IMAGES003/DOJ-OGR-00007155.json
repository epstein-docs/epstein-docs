Anything to take up here from the defense, Ms. Menninger? MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor. Thank you THE COURT: Ms. Moe? MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: Defense 11 is anticipated testimony regarding an alleged rape by Jeffrey Epstein. Let me ask the government to explain what it intends to do with respect to this and for what purpose the testimony would be sought to be introduced. MS. MOE: Certainly, your Honor. As a threshold matter, your Honor, I would note that there is an overlap here between the arguments in the defendant's motion in limine and the 412 motion. I think one motion seeks to introduce some of this evidence but characterize it as consensual and the other motion seeks to preclude it, reference it to be non-consensual. And so, I would be happy to address that now, but it may be easier to address that issue in the context of the 412 briefing. THE COURT: Counsel, do you agree? MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we can wait until the 412 briefing. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007155",
