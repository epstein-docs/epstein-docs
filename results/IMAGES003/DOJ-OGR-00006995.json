I do not think that there is a great hardship or denial of the public's right to know when the Court has just said that the press can be present during the questioning, and that would be the day of the jurors actually being in court. But I think to place the questionnaire and the voir dire questions on the public record and have them reported in the press, a situation that the Court cannot control, will have a very negative effect on both the parties in this case, but most significantly on the party that has been most damaged, that being Ms. Maxwell.\n\nTHE COURT: OK. Any authorities, any specific authorities, and I mean examples of any other -- there are lots of significant high-profile cases that have occurred in this district and others. Any examples, and I don't presume any judge in such a case could control press coverage. I don't even know what that would look like, but you have to try the case as the law requires in a public trial, and surely there are high-profile cases in this modern era, where you could name\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
