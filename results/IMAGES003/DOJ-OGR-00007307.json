Right. Question seven: \"How do online predators, human traffickers, con artists, gangs, cults, and other groups use predatory alienation (term used by interviewee) to isolate young adults and senior citizens?\" 4 5 6 7 Do you see that? 8 A. I do. 9 Q. That's a leading question; right? 10 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection, your Honor. 11 THE COURT: I'll sustain because I'm hoping you'll get to something that is helpful here. 12 13 BY MR. PAGLIUCA: 14 Q. Well, this study has serious flaws, does it not? 15 A. I don't -- I don't think that the study has serious flaws. I think it has a lot of useful information. 16 17 As I said, there's no study I would agree with every single part of. To the extent they're asking experts in the field about groups of behavior strategies, techniques and modus operandi that have been well established and studied and they're asking a group of experts to what degree and what ways have they observed these well-studied phenomena in their respective fields, I think that's an appropriate question that can elicit useful information. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Q. And this is something you are relying on in support of your SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007307",
