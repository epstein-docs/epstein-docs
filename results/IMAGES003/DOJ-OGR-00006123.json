In other words, the Government must show that the agreement went beyond the mere talking stage. It must show that at least one of the conspirators actually did something in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nWith respect to the overt acts for Count One, the Indictment reads as follows: [The Court is respectfully requested to read the overt acts listed under Count One of the Indictment].\n\nWith respect to the overt acts for Count Three, the Indictment reads as follows: [The Court is respectfully requested to read the overt acts listed under Count Three of the Indictment].\n\nWith respect to the overt acts for Count Five, the Indictment reads as follows: [The Court is respectfully requested to read the overt acts listed under Count Five of the Indictment].\n\nIn order for the Government to satisfy this element, it is not necessary for the Government to prove that Ms. Maxwellthe defendant committed the overt act. It is sufficient for the Government to show that any of the members of the conspiracy knowingly committed some overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Further, the overt act need not be one that is alleged in the Indictment. Rather, it can be any overt act that is substantially similar to those acts alleged in the Indictment, if you are convinced that the act occurred while the conspiracy was still in existence and that it was done in furtherance of the conspiracy as described in the Indictment. In addition, you need not be unanimous as to which overt act you find to have been committed.\n\n57\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006123",
