Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudice against probative force under Rule 403 . . . exercises more control over experts than over lay witnesses.\" Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595 (quoting authority omitted).\n\nAmong other things, the Court \"must consider whether an expert's proposed testimony would usurp the province of the judge to instruct on the law, or of the jury to make factual determinations.\" Island Intell.
