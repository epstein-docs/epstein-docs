United States v. Saldarriaga, 204 F.3d 50, (2d\n13 Cir. 2000). That's the first legal principle that frames the\n14 discussion here.\n15 Second, arguments that the government had an improper\n16 motive generally must be directed to the Court rather than the\n17 jury. United States v. Regan, 103 F.3d 1072, (2d Cir. 1997);\n18 see also, United States v.
