Direct\n9 proof of a person's intent is almost never available. It would be a rare case where it could be\n10 shown that a person wrote or stated that, as of a given time, she committed an act with a\n11 particular intent. Such direct proof is not required. The ultimate fact of intent, though subjective,\n12 may be established by circumstantial evidence, based upon the defendant's outward\n13 manifestations, her words, her conduct, her acts and all the surrounding circumstances disclosed\n14 by the evidence and the rational or logical inferences that may be drawn from them.\n15 Significant or Motivating Purpose\n16 In order to establish this element, it is not necessary for the Government to prove that the\n17 illegal sexual activity was Ms. Maxwell's sole purpose for encouraging Jane to travel across state\n18 lines. A person may have several different purposes or motives for such conduct, and each may\n19 prompt in varying degrees the person's actions. The government must prove beyond a\n20 reasonable doubt, however, that a significant or motivating purpose of encouraging Jane to travel\n21 across state lines was that she would engage in illegal sexual activity. In other words, the illegal\n22 sexual activity must not have been merely incidental to the trip.\n23\nDOJ-OGR-00008480",
