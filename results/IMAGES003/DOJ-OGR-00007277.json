THE COURT: Go ahead. MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, your Honor, I understand Jencks Act production, but this is a separate issue. She relied on this in preparation for her testimony today, and I believe that under Rule 16 I am allowed to examine whatever she relied on in anticipation and preparation for her testimony here today. This would be part of the bases for her opinion, your Honor. THE COURT: Well, I don't know if it is. Notes that have a subject heading \"grooming,\" for example, that she threw away which are not in the file are not a bases for her opinion. So I don't know that the whole file is subject to that theory. The contract between her and the government is not a basis for opinion, but you've asked for that since she's included that in the file. MR. PAGLIUCA: I have that, your Honor. THE COURT: Right. But you see the point. MR. PAGLIUCA: I understand. But I don't know what is in her file, is my point. THE COURT: Right. Well, so then the question, I think, is: What is in your file that forms the basis for your opinion? That will get us to where we need to get. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007277",
