Now there is a difference between admitting a witness' prior statements for impeachment purposes, which is protected by the confrontation clause, and admitting prior charging decisions. In a case analogous to this one on this issue, United States v. Borrero, another district court judge held that a defendant could permissibly cross-examine a witness about their prior statement to law enforcement in which they accused a different individual of the crime for which the defendant was later charged. 2013 WL 6020773 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). That case docket is 13 CR 58. But the court there did not admit the charging decision that the early investigation had ended in a nolle, because it would confuse jurors, require extended factual disputes, and was, at best, cumulative of the witness's statement. As I have explained, the same would appear to be true here. Fifth piece of guidance: In contrast to what I indicated may not come in, the Court will permit relevant cross-examination of the government's witnesses. Defense seeks to impeach the credibility of some witnesses by admitting those witnesses' prior statements to the government that purportedly did not implicate Ms. Maxwell.
