It is for you to decide\n4 whether Ms. Maxwell engaged in the other conduct.\n5 Let me remind you that Ms. Maxwell is on trial only for committing acts alleged in the\n6 Indictment. Accordingly, you may not consider this evidence of similar acts as a substitute for\n7 proof that Ms. Maxwell committed the crimes charged. Nor may you consider this evidence as\n8 proof that Ms. Maxwell has a criminal personality or bad character. The evidence of the other,\n9 similar acts was admitted for a much more limited purpose and you may consider it only for that\n10 limited purpose.\n11 If you determine that Ms. Maxwell committed the acts charged in the Indictment and the\n12 similar acts as well, then you may, but you need not draw an inference that in doing the acts\n13 charged in the Indictment, that Ms. Maxwell acted knowingly and intentionally and not because\n14 of some mistake, accident, or other innocent reasons. You may also consider this evidence in\n15 determining whether Ms. Maxwell utilized a common scheme or plan in committing both the\n16 crimes charged in the Indictment and the similar acts introduced by the Government.\n17 Evidence of similar acts may not be considered by you for any other purpose.\n18 Specifically, you may not consider it as evidence that Ms. Maxwell is of bad character or has the\n19 propensity to commit crimes.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-00008774",
