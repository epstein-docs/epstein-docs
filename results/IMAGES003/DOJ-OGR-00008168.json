We have conferred with the government, and they do not agree to the proposed procedure. Among other things, they expressed concern that a juror might see the witness screen. But the jurors are permitted to know the identity of the witnesses testifying under pseudonyms, so that concern seems unjustified to the defense. We believe this process will adequately safeguard everyone's interests and provide for a more efficient trial. We respectfully ask the Court to approve this procedure. Very truly yours. /s/ BOBBI C.
