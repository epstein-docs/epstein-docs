At the same time, these procedures will ensure the First Amendment rights to public access, as is necessary and required by law. I'm going to pause here and ask if counsel have any questions about what I've described so far. Ms. Pomerantz. MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor. The government, I'm happy to raise certain questions we have regarding the names and locations to be supplied in the oral voir dire, as the government has certain proposals that it would like to set forth for the Court. I'm happy to do that now or at another point if the Court would like. THE COURT: Do these proposals relate to the government's motion that was just filed but not fully briefed, or are those separate concerns? MS. POMERANTZ: It relates to the government's motion regarding privacy and dignity of certain minor victims in this case, specifically relating to the request that victims and witnesses, certain victims and witnesses testify under pseudonyms or their first names only. THE COURT: Right. I think I have to get briefing on that motion. Needless to say I'm not prepared to rule on that yet, so to the extent that the proposals you want to suggest had a resolution of that motion, I think we need to wait.
