Accordingly, evidence or arguments that the victims consented to being trafficked, transported, enticed, or sexually exploited would not give rise to a valid defense, and they should be precluded. See Elbert, 561 F.3d at 777-78 (affirming exclusion of evidence of a victim’s consent under Federal Rule of Evidence 412). In the absence of a consent defense, evidence about the victims’ consent to sexual activity should also be excluded as irrelevant. See Fed. R. Evid. 401. Such evidence is not probative or relevant to any issue at the trial. It cannot support a defense, and it does not impeach the witnesses or undermine their credibility.\nAnd in any event, argument and evidence about victims’ consent should be excluded under Rule 403. Any marginal value of such evidence would serve primarily to cast aspersions\n40\nDOJ-OGR-00006401",
