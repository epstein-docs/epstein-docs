Dr. Ryan Hall\nDr. Hall's curriculum vitae is attached as Exhibit D. His report is attached as Exhibit E. Attached as Exhibit F is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Hall.\nDr. Hall is an expert in the field of forensic psychiatry and will offer opinions as such. He will offer the opinions and diagnoses contained in his report, the bases for those opinions, and the significance of the diagnoses and opinions.\nD. Bennett Gershman\nProfessor Gershman is a Distinguished Professor of Law at the Elisabeth Haub School of Law of Pace University since its founding as the Pace Law School in 1976. He has also taught as a visiting professor at Cornell Law School and Syracuse Law School. Prior to coming to Pace, he was a prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and the New York State Anti-Corruption Office. Professor Gershman's extensive scholarship has had an essential role in establishing the study of prosecutorial misconduct, a subject at the intersection of criminal procedure and professional ethics. He is a leading authority on prosecutorial misconduct and the author of the treatise, Prosecutorial Misconduct, a preeminent resource for scholars and practitioners.\nWe expect Professor Gershman to provide testimony on best practices to ensure the integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact, neutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their counsel, and case-related civil litigation. His extensive experience and credentials are recited in his curriculum vitae, annexed as Exhibit G.\nE. Robert Kelso\nMr. Kelso is CEO of Forensic Pursuit.

He is currently an adjunct professor at University of Denver teaching computer forensics at the Master's level. He holds multiple computer forensics certifications including EnCE, CHFI, ACE and AME. His curriculum vitae is attached. Exhibit H. Mr. Kelso has previously testified in federal and state courts as an expert witness in computer forensics and has been appointed a \"special master\" by the court on multiple occasions.\nWe anticipate that Mr. Kelso will testify about the user data associated with certain devices seized and searched by the government's team in this case, documents and photographs extracted from certain of those devices, and the metadata associated with certain documents and photographs. He may also testify generally about computer forensic principles associated with the creation of documents, storage and retrieval of digital documents and photographs, including\nDOJ-OGR-00006192",
