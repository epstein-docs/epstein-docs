The parties would exercise their peremptories, and then I would excuse the unused or struck jurors, swear in our 18, give the instructions, and we'd get on our way. I will say that I think there are advantages and disadvantages to both. I'll also say that I believe both will be logistically possible, although the 29th is not yet totally certain, because jury selection in other cases will go forward on that day, occupying the larger spaces, and it impacts both available space and staff resources. But I believe we can work out the logistics. But before I finalize either way, I wanted to hear the parties' views. Ms. Pomerantz. MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor. The government appreciates the Court's thoughtfulness on this.
