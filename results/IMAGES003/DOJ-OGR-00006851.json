(continued) Study Kogan (2004) Goodman-Brown, Edelstein, Jones and Gordon (2003) Purpose The purpose of this study was to identify factors that influence the disclosure made by female survivors of childhood sexual abuse and to assess the nature of both the disclosure and the receipt of the disclosure. The purpose of this study was to investigate variables associated with child sexual abuse disclosure. Case file reviews of data obtained from prosecutors' offices were conducted for CSA and prosecution on files, as well as structured interviews with the children's caretaker. Incident Categorization modified CSA categorization questions about each sexual event including unwanted sexual contact, character stats and perpetrator character stats were investigated. A subsample of 263 adolescent females between 12 and 17 years old, mean age of 15.7 years old, who reported at least one experience of sexual contact in the NSA, were assessed using a modified CSA categorization. Interviewers asked a series of questions about each unwanted sexual event including unwanted sexual contact, character stats and perpetrator character stats. Data were gathered from a subsample of female adolescents who participated in the NSA. Sample Participants were 218 children referred to CSA, a program for children who had allegedly been sexually abused CSA, a program for children who had allegedly been sexually abused. A total of 64% disclosed within a month and 29% disclosed within 6 months. Five variables were tested: (1) age of child disclosure mode, (2) type of victim consequences of abuse, (3) fear of negative consequences of disclosure. Findings Significant predictors of delay were younger age at first event and evidence of the 26 women who did not disclose during the period with ongoing abuse, 15 worried about not being believed after disclosure. Children under the age of 7 were at risk for delayed disclosure. CSA participants whose USE occurred between the ages of 7 and 13 were more likely to tell an adult. Adolescent peers were more likely to be told than children aged 7-10 years. Children beyond 11-13 tended to disclose to a family member or a friend. Immediate disclosure was associated with a stranger perpetrator. Fear of negative consequences was minimized when the perpetrator was a family member. Legal sample (32%) may account for earlier disclosures. Account suggests that older children with higher rates of extrafamilial abuse compared to intrafamilial abuse, felt greater negative consequences of disclosure, and so the time lag between the USE and disclosure was presumably shorter than study of adult CSA participants. Summary This study examined factors related to disclosure of USEs that occurred in childhood and adolescence. Although data may be retrospective, recall bias may have minimized the results since participants were asked to disclose USE via survey. A though ado escents were associated with a household member, (2) they made surveys more prompt, and (3) they were more likely to tell an adult. This study represents a higher rate of disclosure than in a reported author on which they may expand mode. These cases had been reported to prosecutors and were in process of prosecution. Legal sample with higher rate of extrafamilial abuse (52%) may account for earlier disclosures. Account suggests that older children with higher rates of extrafamilial abuse compared to intrafamilial abuse, felt greater negative consequences of disclosure, and so the time lag between the USE and disclosure was presumably shorter than study of adult CSA participants.
