NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motions for reconsideration. See Dkt. Nos. 407, 408. The Government is hereby ORDERED to respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 408, on or before November 8, 2021.\n\nAs to the motion for reconsideration regarding the disclosure of juror names, the Court reminds counsel of the following. First, as the Court previously indicated, the lawyers will be provided the names of jurors on November 16, prior to the commencement of the voir dire process. Second, the Court has now resolved the logistical issues regarding the ability to conduct peremptory challenges on November 29 and the Court can now confirm that peremptory strikes will not be exercised until November 29. Finally, as previously indicated, although only 40 qualified jurors are needed for the exercise of peremptory strikes, the Court will seek to qualify approximately 50 to 60 prospective jurors to return on November 29 for the exercise of peremptory strikes. If counsel for either side learns of any additional information that would be a basis for a strike for cause prior to November 29, they shall immediately raise the issue with the Court.\n\nBearing in mind this information, the Government is ORDERED to respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 407, on or before November 4, 2021.\n\n1\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006167",
