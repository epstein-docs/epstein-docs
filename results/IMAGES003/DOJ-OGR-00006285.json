However, when considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that individuals with BPD are more likely to have experienced sexual or physical assault (Lieb, et al., 2004) due to the same characteristics of the disorder. Thus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented in an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) defines histrionic personality disorder as \"pervasive and excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior\" (p. 711). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9% of the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2007; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five or more of the following diagnostic criteria:\n1) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of attention;\n2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior;\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallow expressions;\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to the self;\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail;\n6) shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion;\n7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are (p. 714).\nThe primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic criteria 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense desire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follow periods in which they received little attention (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).\nFiling a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that may be used to seek attention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost attention, either from the desired partner or from other\nDOJ-OGR-00006285",
