To be sure, the government's notice and Rocchio's CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-reviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary, a review of grooming literature shows that grooming does not have a consistent definition and \"there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\" Natalie Bennett & William O'Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2014).\n\nRocchio's opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider of individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on experience \"must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,\" and she must do more than \"propound a particular interpretation of [a party's] conduct.\" Primavera Familienstifung v. Askin, 130 F. Supp. 2d 450, 530 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).4 An expert relies \"solely or primarily on experience, the witness must explain how that experience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.\" Fed.

Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio's personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her patients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were abused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because \"[t]here is also no known or identified rate of error to [Rocchio's] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio's] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating [her] abuse.\" United States v.
