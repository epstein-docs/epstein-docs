Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nNovember 4, 2021\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully moves for reconsideration of the portions of the Court's order dated November 3, 2021 (Dkt. No. 409), directing the Government to file by November 8, 2021, any briefing to exclude any defense witness testimony disclosed on November 1, 2021, with defense responses due November 11, 2021.\nThis schedule provides the Government seven days—or six, if timed from the Court's order—to respond to the defense's expert notice, in which they gave notice for the first time of eight potential experts. By contrast, the Government notes that it provided the defense with notice of its expert on April 23, 2021, and the defense filed its motion to preclude on October 18, 2021.1\nMoreover, during that time, the Government will be (1) preparing for the November 10, 2021 Daubert hearing; (2) responding to the defendant's motion for reconsideration regarding disclosure of juror names (Dkt. No. 407); (3) providing the defense with categories of its co-conspirator statements and exemplars; (4) briefing the admissibility of Minor Victim-3's testimony admission through Rule 702 on September 15, 2021. The defense has not moved to preclude that witness.\n1 The Government also provided expert notice of a witness who it does not believe requires admission through Rule 702 on September 15, 2021. The defense has not moved to preclude that witness.\nDOJ-OGR-00006162",
