The most important\n\n3\n\npart of this case, members of the jury, is the part that you as jurors are now about to play as you\n\n4\ndeliberate on the issues of fact. It is for you, and you alone, to weigh the evidence in this case\n\n5\n\nand determine whether the Government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the\n\n6\n\nessential elements of the crime with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. If the Government has\n\n7\n\nsucceeded, your verdict should be guilty as to that charge; if it has failed, your verdict should be\n\n8\n\nnot guilty as to that charge.\n\n9\n\nYou must base your verdict solely on the evidence or lack of evidence and these\n\n10\n\ninstructions as to the law, and you are obliged under your oath as jurors to follow the law as I\n\n11\nhave instructed you, whether you agree or disagree with the particular law in question.\n\n12\n\nUnder your oath as jurors, you are not to be swayed by sympathy. You should be guided\n\n13\n\nsolely by the evidence presented during the trial and the law as I gave it to you, without regard\n\n14\n\nto the consequences of your decision. You have been chosen to try the issues of fact and reach a\n\n15\n\nverdict on the basis of the evidence or lack of evidence. If you let sympathy interfere with your\n\n16\n\nclear thinking, there is a risk that you will not arrive at a just verdict.\n\n17\n\nAs you deliberate, please listen to the opinions of your fellow jurors, and ask for an\n\n18\n\nopportunity to express your own views. Every juror should be heard. No one juror should hold\n\n19\n\ncenter stage in the jury room and no one juror should control or monopolize the deliberations.\n\n20\n\nIf, after listening to your fellow jurors and if, after stating your own view, you become\n\n21\n\nconvinced that your view is wrong, do not hesitate because of stubbornness or pride to change\n\n22\n\nyour view. On the other hand, do not surrender your honest convictions and beliefs solely\n\n23\n\nbecause of the opinions of your fellow jurors or because you are outnumbered. Your final vote\n\n24\n\nmust reflect your conscientious belief as to how the issues should be decided.\n\n79\n\nDOJ-OGR-00008700",
