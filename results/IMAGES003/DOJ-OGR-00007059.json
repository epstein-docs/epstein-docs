Raniere, Docket No. 622 at 32.\nGiven the sensitive and inflammatory nature of the conduct alleged, such publicity may cause further harassment or embarrassment, and other alleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from coming forward. See, Martinez, 17 CR 281, (E.D.N.Y. 2017), Docket No. 34.\nLimiting the disclosure of alleged victims' identities in this case furthers these important interests. The same is true with the identities of certain witnesses, although not alleged victims themselves, because the disclosure of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of the alleged victims.\nI'm not persuaded by defense counsel's arguments to the contrary. First, the defense notes that Ms. Maxwell does not pose a threat to any of the witnesses. That is plainly true, and the government does not argue or suggest or allege otherwise, but just because that reason for limiting disclosures is absent in this case does not eliminate the possibility of other justifications. And again, there is a need here to prevent undue embarrassment, harassment from the press and third parties, and any resistance of others to come forward and report alleged abuse. Cases establish that this is sufficient\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00007059",
