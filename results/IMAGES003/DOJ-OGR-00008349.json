So we'll have -- and you've been provided that -- jurors in the two different courtrooms. We'll meet here at 8:30, by the way. So once we have all of the jurors assembled, we'll have the video feed, and I will say good morning to them and then say I'm going to ask two questions and if they have a \"yes\" response to either of the questions they should raise their hand.

Once we get through that, then we'll have our pool, and your peremptories will be exercised on the first 40 jurors in ascending order. Any questions about that?
