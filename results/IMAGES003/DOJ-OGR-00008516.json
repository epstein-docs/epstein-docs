I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it\n\n6\n\ninvolves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.\n\n7\n\nWhat is an \"inference\"? What does it mean to \"infer\" something? An inference is not a\n\n8\n\nsuspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists\n\n9\n\nbased on another fact that you are satisfied exists.\n\n10\n\nThere are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by\n\n11\n\ndirect or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while\n\n12\n\nthe defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you\n\n13\n\nwill draw.\n\n14\n\nThe process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a matter of guesswork or\n\n15\n\nspeculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permitted but not\n\n16\n\nrequired to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial\n\n17\n\nevidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.\n\n18\n\nTherefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from\n\n19\n\nthe facts that you find to be proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of\n\n20\n\nyour experience.\n\n21\n\nSome inferences, however, are impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is\n\n22\n\nguilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the\n\n23\n\ncrime was being committed and had knowledge that it was being committed.\n\n59\n\nDOJ-OGR-00008516",
