The Southern District of New York\n\n5\n\nencompasses the following counties: New York County (i.e., Manhattan), Bronx, Westchester,\n\n6\n\nRockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan Counties. Anything that occurs in any of\n\n7\n\nthose places occurs in the Southern District of New York.\n\n8\n\nVenue must be examined separately for each count in the Indictment. Venue on one\n\n9\n\ncount does not establish venue on another count, though if applicable, you may rely on the same\n\n10\n\nevidence to establish venue on multiple counts.\n\n11\n\nOn the issue of venue—and this alone—the Government need not prove venue beyond a\n\n12\n\nreasonable doubt, but only by a mere preponderance of the evidence. A \"preponderance of the\n\n13\n\nevidence\" means more likely than not. Thus, the Government, which does bear the burden of\n\n14\n\nproving venue, has satisfied that burden as to venue if you conclude that it is more likely than not\n\n15\n\nthat some act in furtherance of each charged offense occurred in the Southern District of New\n\n16\n\nYork. If, on the other hand, you find that the Government has failed to prove the venue\n\n17\n\nrequirement as to a particular offense, then you must acquit Ms. Maxwell of that offense, even if\n\n18\n\nall the other elements of the offense are proven.\n\n56\nDOJ-OGR-00008513",
