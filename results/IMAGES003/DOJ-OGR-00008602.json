It is your job to decide how\n3\nbelievable each witness was in his or her testimony. You are the sole judges of the credibility of\n4\nthe witnesses. How do you evaluate the credibility or believability of the witnesses? The answer\n5\nis that you use your common sense, judgment, and experience. Common sense is your greatest\n6\nasset as a juror. You should ask yourselves, did the witness impress you as honest, open, and\n7\ncandid? Or did the witness appear evasive, as though the witness was trying to hide something?\n8\nHow responsive was the witness to the questions asked on direct examination and on cross-\n9\nexamination? Consider the witness's demeanor, manner of testifying, and accuracy of the\n10\nwitness's recollection. In addition, consider how well the witness recounted what was heard or\n11\nobserved, as the witness may be honest but mistaken.\n12\nIf you find that a witness is intentionally telling a falsehood that is always a matter of\n13\nimportance that you should weigh carefully. If you find that any witness has lied under oath at\n14\nthis trial, you should view the testimony of such a witness cautiously and weigh it with great\n15\ncare. You may reject the entirety of the witness testimony, part of it or none of it. It is for you to\n16\ndecide how much of any witness's testimony, if any, you wish to credit. A witness may be\n17\ninaccurate, contradictory, or even untruthful in some respects and yet entirely believable and\n18\ntruthful in other respects. It is for you to determine whether such untruths or inconsistencies are\n19\nsignificant or inconsequential, and whether to accept or reject all or to accept some and reject the\n20\nbalance of the testimony of any witness.\n21\nIn evaluating credibility of the witnesses, you should take into account any evidence that\n22\nthe witness who testified may benefit in some way from the outcome of this case. If you find\n23\nthat any witness whose testimony you are considering may have an interest in the outcome of\n24\nthis trial, then you should bear that factor in mind when evaluating the credibility of his or her\n63\nDOJ-OGR-00008602",
