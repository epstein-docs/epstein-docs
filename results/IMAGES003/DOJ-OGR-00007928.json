I wanted to direct your attention to the use of the term grooming, so in that top paragraph. If you could review the section of the article that starts with \"If their use of the term grooming\" and all the way to the end of that paragraph and let me know when you have had a chance to review it, please.\n2 A. Okay.\n3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what is your response, reaction to this passage?\n4 A. It's a bit confusing as to the point that's being made. I feel like they're trying to -- the author here seems to be mixing different applications of the term that they use grooming, so it looks like in part he's talking about what is true in the literature, which is that we're not particularly good as a field of taking, frankly, many behaviors at all and predicting future behaviors. So he's saying accurately that we can't look at specific behaviors alone as predictors.\n5 And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is used to describe a process, a pattern of behaviors. I'm not here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these particular behaviors, yes, we know you're a child abuser. So he's making that point. But I don't think anybody -- I don't think that -- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with that. Except that he's then going on -- I disagree where he says that grooming then can't involve behaviors that might in fact be prosocial or normal.\n6 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
