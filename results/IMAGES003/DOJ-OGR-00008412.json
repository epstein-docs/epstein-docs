At base, the Court encourages the parties to confer on appropriate process for putting background information in front of the jury, as necessary, to allow the kinds of cross-examination that would be permissible and required under the relevant law. Let me pause and ask counsel if they have any questions with respect to the guidance I have offered at this time. Obviously there may be issues we will need to take up as we go. Ms. Moe? MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank you. MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, Christian Everdell. Not at this time, your Honor. THE COURT: Thank you. No. 6, evidence that goes to consent issues. The government requests to exclude evidence or argument regarding consent. Now let me ask counsel, it seems to me the issues implicated in this motion overlap, at least potentially, to the issues raised and to be discussed in the 412 motion and I am wondering if we should at least begin by taking it up at that time, as necessary. MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government agrees that makes SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00008412",
