Carolyn\n9 truthfully told both Epstein and Maxwell her age; (2) Between in or about 2001 and in or about\n10 2004, Epstein and Maxwell both encouraged and enticed Carolyn to recruit other girls to engage\n11 in paid sex acts with Epstein, which she did; (3) Between in or about 2001 and in or about 2004,\n12 Epstein's employees sent Carolyn gifts, including lingerie, from an address in the Southern\n13 District of New York to Carolyn's residence in Florida. For example, on one occasion in or about\n14 October of 2002, Epstein caused a package to be sent by Federal Express from an address in\n15 Manhattan to Carolyn in Florida; (4) On multiple occasions between in or about 2001 and in or\n16 about 2004, Epstein, Maxwell, or one of Epstein's other employees called Carolyn to schedule an\n17 appointment for Carolyn to massage Epstein. For example, in or about April of 2004 and May of\n18 2004 another employee of Epstein's called Carolyn to schedule such appointments.\n19 In order for the Government to satisfy this element, it is not necessary for the\n20 Government to prove that Ms. Maxwell committed the overt act. It is sufficient for the\n21 Government to show that any of the members of the conspiracy knowingly committed some\n22 overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Further, the overt act need not be one that is alleged in\n23 the Indictment. Rather, it can be any overt act that is substantially similar to those acts alleged in\n50\nDOJ-OGR-00008757",
