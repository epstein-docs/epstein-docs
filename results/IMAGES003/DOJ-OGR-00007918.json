So they had each of those behaviors rated on a four point scale by all of the professionals. And then they conducted analysis to see which of the items for which there was a high level, statistically significant level of agreement between the professionals, as to which of these behaviors were relevant. And they then went back and they asked, of those behaviors, where was their agreement on which stages that these specific behaviors belonged to. So I think they were able, through that analysis, to get a statistically significant agreement about behaviors. I think they narrowed it down to about 43 specific behaviors in this particular model. Q. I want to direct your attention to Page 3. A. Okay. Q. What is this table? A.
