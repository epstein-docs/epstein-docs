First, it is the practice in this district to place on the record at a final pretrial conference the status of plea discussions and so I just wanted to place on the record -- THE COURT: I guess I hadn't assumed this is our final pretrial conference and I do usually do that, but there is no point in not at least doing that now in case we don't get together again, which seems unlikely. But, go ahead. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor; for that reason we wanted to place on the record that the government has not issued any plea offers to the defense and the defense has not requested any plea offers from the government, and we would respectfully request that the Court confer with the defendant that that is accurate.
