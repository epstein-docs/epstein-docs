Here, both of those interests are satisfied. The defendant knows who the Minor Victims and other witnesses are and has conducted a fulsome investigation, as shown by the defendant's brief in opposition. And the jury, which will also know the true names of the Minor Victims, will fully understand whatever information the defense elicits on cross-examination or at trial. For instance, as the Government has said, the defense is free to elicit the fact that . (Compare Def. Opp. 21, with Gov't Mot. at 15 n.6 (\"The Government has no objection to cross-examination . \"). The only substantive limit the Government proposes on the defendant's ability to elicit information is certain detailed personally identifying information, none of which is relevant or necessary to elicit at trial.
