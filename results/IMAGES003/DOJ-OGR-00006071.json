The lawyers' arguments are intended to convince you to draw certain conclusions from the evidence or lack of evidence. Those arguments are important. You should weigh and evaluate them carefully. But you must not confuse them with the evidence. If your recollection of the evidence differs from the statements of the lawyers, follow your recollection.\n\nYou should draw no inference or conclusion for or against any party by reason of lawyers making objections or my rulings on such objections. Counsel have not only the right but the duty to make legal objections that they think are appropriate. You should not be swayed against the Government or the Defendant simply because counsel for either side has chosen to make an objection. Similarly, statements made by counsel when arguing the admissibility of evidence are not to be considered as evidence.\n\nIf I comment on the evidence during my instructions, do not accept my statements in place of your recollection. Again, it is your recollection that governs.\n\nDo not concern yourself with what was said at side bar conferences or during my discussions with counsel. Those discussions related to rulings of law, which are my duty, and not to matters of fact, which are your duty to determine.\n\nAt times I may have admonished a witness or directed a witness to be responsive to questions, to keep his or her voice up, or to repeat an answer. My instructions were intended only to clarify the presentation of evidence.
