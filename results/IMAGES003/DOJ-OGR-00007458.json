For now, suffice it to\n9 say that you bring with you into this courtroom all of the experience and\n10 background of your lives. Do not leave your common sense outside the courtroom.\n11 The same types of tests that you use in your everyday dealings are the tests that\n12 you should apply in deciding how much weight, if any, to give to the evidence in\n13 this case.\n14 The law does not require you to accept all of the evidence admitted at trial.\n15 In determining what evidence you accept, you must make your own evaluation of\n16 the testimony from each of the witnesses and the exhibits that are received in\n17 evidence.\n18 It is essential, however, that you keep an open mind until you have heard all\n19 of the evidence in the case.
