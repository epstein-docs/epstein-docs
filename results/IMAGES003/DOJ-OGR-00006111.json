The crime of conspiracy to violate federal law is an independent offense. It is separate and distinct from the actual violation of any specific federal laws, which the law refers to as \"substantive crimes.\" Indeed, you may find the defendant Ms. Maxwell guilty of conspiring to violate federal law even if you find that the crime which was the object of the conspiracy was never actually committed.\n\nAs I will explain, the three different conspiracy counts are separate offenses and each conspiracy alleges a different purpose, which I will describe to you shortly.\n\nAdapted from Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instr. 19-2; the charge of the Hon.
