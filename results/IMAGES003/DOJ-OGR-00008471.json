It is not evidence. It is not proof of Ms. Maxwell's guilt. It creates no presumption\n\n5 and it permits no inference that Ms. Maxwell is guilty. Ms. Maxwell begins trial with an\n\n6 absolutely clean slate and without any evidence against her. You must give no weight to the fact\n\n7 that an Indictment has been returned against Ms. Maxwell.\n\n8 I will not read the entire Indictment to you at this time.
