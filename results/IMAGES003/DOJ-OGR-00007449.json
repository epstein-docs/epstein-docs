NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn November 1, 2021, the Defense noticed eight expert witnesses. Dkt. No. 418-1. On November 15, 2021, the Government filed a motion to preclude the testimony of six of the experts. See id. The Defense filed a response on November 19, 2021, and the Government filed a motion for leave to file a reply on November 22, 2021.1 The moving papers have been filed temporarily under seal to permit the parties the opportunity to propose sealing or limited redactions in accordance with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).\nIn two Memorandum Opinions and Orders temporarily filed under seal, the Court GRANTS the Government's motion to preclude as to Dr. Ryan Hall's testimony and GRANTS the Government's motion to preclude as to Bennett Gershman's testimony.\nThe Court will send the temporarily sealed Memorandum Opinions and Orders to the parties. By November 24, 2021, the parties are ORDERED to inform the Court whether either seeks sealing or limited redactions of the Memorandum Opinions and Orders, justifying any such request by reference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\n1 The Court denies the Government's request to file a reply because the Government's motion to preclude and the Defendant's response are sufficient for this Court to rule on the motion.\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00007449",
