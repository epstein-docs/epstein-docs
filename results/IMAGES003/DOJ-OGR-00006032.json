Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nNovember 2, 2021\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's Order dated October 29, 2021 (Dkt. No. 420) ordering the Government to respond to the defendant's October 29, 2021 letter regarding delivery of the defendant's legal mail at the Metropolitan Detention Center (\"MDC\") (Dkt. No. 381). The Government also writes in response to questions raised by the defense at the November 1, 2021 conference about materials sent to the defendant last week.\nThe Government has conferred with legal counsel at the MDC, and was informed of the following: Legal mail from a defendant's counsel sent through the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") has a different delivery process than that outlined in the Government's October 15, 2021 letter as to electronic discovery provided by the Government (Dkt. No. 350). MDC's Legal Department is not involved in the delivery of legal mail sent by a defendant's counsel. Instead, MDC mail room staff must pick up such mail from the post office once every business day. The mail room staff picks up the mail in the morning. After picking up the mail, the mail room staff must log the mail. Once the mail is logged, the respective unit managers retrieve the mail from the mail room and deliver the mail to the inmates. If, for example, mail is delivered to the post office,\nDOJ-OGR-00006032",
