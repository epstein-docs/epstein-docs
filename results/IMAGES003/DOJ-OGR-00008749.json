A conspiracy is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6\n7 The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n8 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\n9 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\n10 crime of conspiracy.\n11 In order to show that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must show that two or more\n12 people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\n13 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\n14 plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or attachment to a\n15 conspiracy. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\n16 understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\n17 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\n18 To show that a conspiracy existed, the Government is not required to show that two or\n19 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\n20 they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n21 tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the\n22 unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an\n23 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n24 acknowledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-00008749",
