It's\n13 not my job to go out and verify any part of what's being told\n14 in the clinical room, but, rather, to hear what they're telling\n15 me and then relate that back to my other skills-training\n16 experience, the scientific literature. Someone, for example,\n17 might report to me symptoms of depression.
