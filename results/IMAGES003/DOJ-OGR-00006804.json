Physical contact is then gradually increased. Furthermore, Gallagher (2000) found that in cases where \"entrapment\" behaviors were reported, 43% of perpetrators initiated physical contact with the child and 17% behaved in a sexual manner with the child.\nFurthermore, differences between genders of the victim have also been noted in the sexual desensitization type of grooming. Spiegel (2003) noted that the use of pornography to sexually desensitize children is more common with male victims than with female victims.\nBoundary Violations\nBerliner and Conte (1990) found that 70% of children reported that their abusers \"accidentally\" came into their bedroom or bathroom while they were undressing; 61% indicated that their abusers \"accidentally\" touched their private parts; 61% said that their abusers did not respect their privacy or let them close doors; 61% reported that their abusers \"accidentally\" showed their naked body to them; 57% indicated that their abusers would purposely do things with the child that involved physical contact; 48% said that their abusers made sexual comments about the child's body or clothing; 44% reported that their abusers asked them to do things that involved physical contact; 30% said that their abusers would inspect the child's body \"to see how it was developing\"; 30% indicated that their abusers \"taught sex education\" by showing pornographic pictures and touching the child's body; 26% reported that their abusers told the child about sexual things he had previously done; and 22% indicated that their abusers put lotion or ointment on the child when they were alone but said he was doing nothing wrong.\nAccording to Christiansen and Blake's (1990) stages of grooming in father-daughter incest, the last step involves the father violating his daughter's boundaries. In particular, fathers may insist on bathing their daughters and do not allow other family members to do this. These baths frequently involve inappropriate sexual behavior. Fathers also insist on dressing their daughters or on watching them get dressed. In addition, fathers will tend to watch the child use the bathroom. Finally, perpetrating fathers will have sexually explicit conversations with the daughter to further desensitize them.\nGrooming the Child's Environment\nElliott and colleagues (1995) found that 20% of the offenders in their sample admitted they gained the trust of the child's family with the purpose of abusing the child. Forty-eight percent isolated their victims through babysitting. Furthermore, Knoll (2010) found that a teacher can also manipulate the\nDOJ-OGR-00006804",
