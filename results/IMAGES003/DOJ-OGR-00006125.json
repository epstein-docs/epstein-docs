In this regard, you should bear in mind that the overt act, standing alone, may be an innocent, lawful act. Frequently, however, an apparently innocent act sheds its harmless character if it is a step in carrying out, promoting, aiding or assisting the conspiratorial scheme. You are therefore, instructed that the overt act does not have to be an act which, in and of itself is criminal or constitutes an objective of the conspiracy.\nCommented [CE82]: The fourth element is consistent with Sand and the Court's recent instructions on this issue. See Sand, Instr 19-8; United States v. Pizcarro, 17 Cr 151 (AJN)\nCommented [RA(83R82]: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:\nThe Court has also combined this element with the third element. See United States v. Lebedev, 15 Cr 769 (AJN)\nThe Government defers to the Court's preference\nDOJ-OGR-00006125",
