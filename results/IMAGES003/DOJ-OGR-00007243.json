So to the extent that more of my patients are women than men, certainly that's a vulnerability. But also, because, especially now, I'm working with adults, I'm working with people who have been repeatedly victimized at various points in time in their lives. And you can really clearly see the pattern, and it's something I often have to address with patients because they inquire about it, they don't understand. You know, why is it that this has happened to me so many times. And, again, we know from the revictimization literature that when someone is abused, they are at higher risk of being abused at later points in time. Also, you know, sometimes the clinical literature individuals will talk about the specific issues in their family that perhaps increase their vulnerability: They were always alone. They, you know, their mom was sick and this person had lots of opportunity to kind of befriend the family and, you know, therefore had greater access as a result of that vulnerability, or perhaps they were desperate for attention, care, love, and concern from another person because those are common childhood needs and maybe they weren't getting that at home.
