I might go back to some of the original sources cited in the reference list, for example, and look at those articles to see if in the article I'm reading, when they describe article X, when I read article X, is that actually what article X is saying. Also, there are researchers who have come to be known in a particular field, so I might look at who the authors are and where the research is being conducted. Q. Beyond what you have already described, can you give any examples of how studies are conducted? A. They're conducted in a variety of ways. So for example -- I think I may have already described it -- but there are a variety of ways people might interview offenders and ask them what they do, what strategies and tactics they use. There might be studies that look at victims reporting what their experiences are. Or there might be studies where you're looking at treatment of victims and what are some of the issues that patients are bringing to treatment that need to be addressed, so the strategies that they experienced might come out that way. Certainly, studies have been done interviewing various experts, asking them what are strategies. And then looking for what are the strategies that experts from a variety of different fields agree upon, to a degree of certainty, and what do these professionals agree are part of what they see. Q. Do studies use the same or different definitions of grooming? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007221",
