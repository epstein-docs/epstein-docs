If the witness denied it was his statement, the matter could then be resolved by calling the FBI agent who had compiled the report. We do not think Rule 613(a) was intended to take away the district judge's discretion to manage the trial in a way designed to promote accuracy and fairness; and while it would be wrong for a judge to say, \"In my court we apply the common law rule, not Rule 613(a),\" he is entitled to conclude that in particular circumstances the older approach should be used in order to avoid confusing witnesses and jurors\n\nId. at 1211; see also Sloman v.

Soundingsides, 825 F.2d 1468, 1470 (10th Cir. 1987) (denying petition for rehearing). But see United States v. Strother, 49 F.3d 869, 876 (2d Cir. 1995) (“Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement is more persuasive to a jury than a witness's acknowledgement of inconsistencies in a prior statement.”).1 It is irrelevant that the witness then chooses to stand by her trial testimony.\n\nFinally, the Government believes the statements at Tr. 455:3-18, 532:12-17, and 596:7-25\n\n1 The Government believes Strother, which involved a harmless error analysis of two critical memoranda, is distinguishable from this case.
