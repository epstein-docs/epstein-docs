Factual Narratives About the Case\nThe following opinions are objectionable vehicles for factual narrative about the case:\n- Identification of “some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case,” as described in Paragraph 6 above.\n- How, “in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the construction of distorted memories,” as described in Paragraph 7 above.\nDr. Loftus should be precluded from embedding a factual narrative about the case in her opinions. Dr. Loftus has not evaluated any of the victims in this case. Unlike Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus does not even describe what case-specific materials she has reviewed. (Cf. Ex. A at 3 (“Attached as Exhibit C [and Exhibit B to this motion] is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Dietz.”)). Dr. Loftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “suggestive activities” may have influenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to show that she has “reliably applied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed.
