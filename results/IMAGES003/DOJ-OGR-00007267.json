  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 467 Filed 11/15/21 Page 88 of 158 88 LBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct kids around the time, so not as much delayed. Q. Approximately what percentage of the patients you treated and assessed disclosed that they experienced childhood sexual abuse at the time of the abuse? A. A very, very small number. I, I can probably count on one hand the number of patients, in my private practice, who said that they told right away. With younger children in particular, we also know that it's more likely with very young children not so much that they're just going to spontaneously go to someone and tell them but that's it's going to be accidentally discovered or someone else finds out about it and then inquires, and that's how that information comes out. But, again, we know that most victims of childhood sexual abuse don't end up disclosing until some significant point in time after the event, and that's consistent with what I've experienced in my practice. Q. You just mentioned very young children. What are you referring to? A. We know that delayed disclosure happens over time. But we also know that the younger the child, the more likely it is that the disclosure or the discovery of the abuse happens accidentally. Q. Are you aware of other psychologists treating and evaluate patients who have delay disclosing childhood sexual abuse? A. Yes. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007267",
