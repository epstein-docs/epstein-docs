Thank you. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim? MS. STERNHEIM: No. THE COURT: I think what I am also going to do, we haven't talked through the specifics of the logistics of the voir dire days -- I think I did generally -- but we are going to have a morning panel, the jurors are going to come in to a courtroom which is sort of the holding courtroom. The preliminary instructions will be played and then we bring them in one at a time. The afternoon panel is going to assemble somewhere else so there is no overlap, they'll be played the instructions. Once we are finished with the morning panel, they'll be brought in and the like. We will do the individual voir dire, obviously if anyone is struck for cause following that they'll be excused. Those who are not struck for cause, what I propose is that we give them an instruction sheet that tells them where and when they're returning for the final stage of the process and remind them the basic instructions about media restrictions and the like just so they have that and they take it with them. Of course I would show you what I am thinking before we do it but that basic idea. I want to see if anybody has any concerns or SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007159",
