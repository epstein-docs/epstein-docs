At that time, Attorney General William Barr said he initially had his own suspicions about Epstein's death while detained at the MCC but came to conclude that Epstein's death, an apparent suicide, was the result of \"a perfect storm of screw-ups.\"1 During an interview with ABC News, Barr stated he was \"livid\" when he learned that Jeffrey Epstein had committed suicide and \"happy that they had gotten Ms. Maxwell.\"2 When asked if the government had Maxwell's security \"locked in\" to ensure she would neither be able to kill herself or be harmed, Barr answered, with a mixture of laughter and a smile on his face: \"Yes. We have asked them to tell us specifically the protocols they're following, and we have a number of redundant systems to monitor the situation.\" Id. (emphasis added.) Ms. Maxwell has consistently described, and complained formally, of being subject to unfair and inconsistent treatment and threatening and intimidating behavior by corrections officers and ongoing sleep deprivation throughout her incarceration. The flashlight checks every 15 minutes have significantly hindered her ability to sleep, as she frequently wakes up every time the guards shine the flashlight into her cell. When she has been transported from the detention facility to court, she is awakened between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m., transported to the courthouse, and held in a cold cell on an approximately 12-inch metal bench for hours prior to her scheduled court appearance.
