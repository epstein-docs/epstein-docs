It will give Juror 50 an improper preview of information he does not have and should never have, or at the very least should not have at this point in the process. This information includes, among other things: (i) Juror 50's exact responses to the questions on the jury questionnaire, which is not currently public and which he presumably has not had access to since he submitted it to the Court, (ii) data about the responses of other jurors and potential jurors to the jury questionnaire, (iii) the details of the investigative steps the defense has taken and the evidence we have uncovered thus far, (iv) the defense's legal theories and arguments, (v) the defense's view of the underlying facts, and (vi) the scope of the defense's requested discovery in advance of the hearing. The Motion will provide a roadmap of the defense's examination of Juror 50 and will allow him to plan out and tailor his responses, or even potentially spoliate evidence, to paint himself and his conduct in the best light possible.
