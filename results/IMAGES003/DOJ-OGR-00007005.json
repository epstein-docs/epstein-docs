THE COURT: So you've changed the question beyond inserting \"protested.\" MS. STERNHEIM: That's correct. THE COURT: Let me ask you to give that to me again. MS. STERNHEIM: Of course. \"Have you or any family member ever lobbied, petitioned, protested, or worked in any other manner for or against any laws or regulations relating to sex trafficking, sex crimes against minors, sex abuse, or sexual harassment generally, or supported organizations that seek to address sex abuse or sexual harassment generally?\" THE COURT: Just a moment. Ms. Pomerantz. MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor. The government doesn't have an issue with adding the word \"protested,\" but I would submit that the additional language proposed by the defense makes the question a bit vague, and I think the Court's question, as framed, captures sufficient information and should get, I think, several responses from prospective jurors. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, I will accept \"protested\"; SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007005",
