Under our Constitution, a defendant has no obligation to testify or to present any evidence, because it is the Government's burden to prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. That burden remains with the Government throughout the entire trial and never shifts to a defendant. A defendant is never required to prove that she is innocent.\nYou may not attach any significance to the fact that the defendant Ms. Maxwell did not testify.\nNo adverse inference against the defendant Ms. Maxwell may be drawn by you because the defendant she did not take the witness stand. You may not consider this against the defendant Ms. Maxwell in any way in your deliberations in the jury room.\nAdapted from Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instr. 5-21; and the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United States v. Jones, 16 Cr. 553 (AJN) and in United States v. Pizarro, 17 Cr. 151 (AJN).\n\n80\nDOJ-OGR-00006146",
