A conspiracy is an agreement or an\n4 understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or\n5 unlawful purpose.\n6 The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more\n7 people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning\n8 the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the\n9 crime of conspiracy.\n10 In order to show that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must show that two or more\n11 people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken\n12 or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful\n13 plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or attachment to a\n14 conspiracy. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an\n15 understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then\n16 the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.\n17 To show that a conspiracy existed, the Government is not required to show that two or\n18 more people sat around a table and entered into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that\n19 they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense\n20 tells you that when people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the\n21 unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an\n22 explicit agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements to writing or\n23 acknowledge them before a notary public, nor do they publicly broadcast their plans.\n42\nDOJ-OGR-00008663",
