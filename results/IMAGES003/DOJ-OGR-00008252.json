And as I said, only if the jurors indicated a specific wish to speak not in public because the answer would embarrass them or otherwise seriously compromise their privacy, other than that, we'll proceed in open court. But with respect to those, I'm doing that to ensure juror candor and honesty and ultimately ensure the selection of a fair and impartial jury.\nProcess-wise, during the questioning, as the juror is answering my questions in the voir dire, if I think a juror answers in a way that would require striking for cause, I'll ask counsel whether they have any objection. Meaning do you have any objection to me striking for cause. Assuming no objection, then I will strike that juror for cause, and they'll be excused and we'll give them instructions.\nIf I don't think that any answer requires a striking for cause before we get to the individual questions at the end of the voir dire, I'll ask counsel if they have specific followup. If you have specific followup, I'll hear you at sidebar, that is, outside the hearing of the juror, consider your request for followup, and then either engage in that followup or not, and proceed apace.\nIf we have a juror for whom there is no basis to strike for cause, at that point, we'll proceed to have them respond to the individual questions in the voir dire.
