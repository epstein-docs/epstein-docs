The letter is submitted temporarily under seal to allow defense counsel the opportunity to propose any additional redactions beyond what the Government proposes.\n\nAt the November 1, 2021 conference, the Court asked the Government to provide its position as to whether Alleged \"Victim-3\" could be considered a \"victim\" of the crimes charged in the indictment for any legal purpose, including for purposes of restitution under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). See Transcript at 71-72. The Government's supplemental letter does not address this issue.
