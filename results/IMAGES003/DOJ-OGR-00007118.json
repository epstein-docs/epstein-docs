This is the issue of evidence related to alleged Victim-3.\n2 Defense seeks to exclude evidence related to this individual that's not probative of the charged conspiracy and inadmissible under 404(b) and 403. There are redactions issues here. Redactions of specific identifying information is permissible here. I don't think that redactions as to some general background information that does not reveal specific identifying information regarding the alleged victims is necessary, but we'll proceed bearing in mind the requested redactions.\n3 I want to begin this one with questions for the government. Ms. Moe, so it's a hypothetical. I gather there's statute of limitations issues, but setting the statute of limitations issue aside, if the only evidence in the case pertained to this individual, if all the testimony of this individual is accepted by the jury, could the defendant be found guilty of any crimes charged in the indictment?\n4 MS. MOE: With respect, just so I understand the hypothetical, if the only count in the indictment were the Mann Act conspiracy --\n5 THE COURT: No, any of the crimes charged, just stipulate to that, but if the only evidence pertains to this individual.\n6 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. The answer is no. In\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00007118",
