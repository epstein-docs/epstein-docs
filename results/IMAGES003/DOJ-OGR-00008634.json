  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 563 Filed 12/18/21 Page 96 of 167\n1\nInstruction No. 8: Reasonable Doubt\n2\nThe question that naturally arises is: \"What is a reasonable doubt?\" What does that\n3\nphrase mean? The words almost define themselves. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based in\n4\nreason and arising out of the evidence in the case, or the lack of evidence. It is a doubt that a\n5\nreasonable person has after carefully weighing all of the evidence in the case.\n6\nReasonable doubt is a doubt that appeals to your reason, your judgment, your experience,\n7\nand your common sense. Reasonable doubt is not whim or speculation. It is not an excuse to\n8\navoid an unpleasant duty. Nor is it sympathy for the Defendant. The law in a criminal case is\n9\nthat it is sufficient if the guilt of the Defendant is established beyond a reasonable doubt, not\n10\nbeyond all possible doubt. Therefore, if, after a fair and impartial consideration of all the\n11\nevidence, you can candidly and honestly say that you do have an abiding belief of Ms.\n12\nMaxwell's guilt as to any crime charged in this case, such a belief as a prudent person would be\n13\nwilling to act upon in important matters in the personal affairs of his or her own life, then you\n14\nhave no reasonable doubt, and under such circumstances it is your duty to convict Ms. Maxwell\n15\nof the particular crime in question.\n16\nOn the other hand, if after a fair and impartial consideration of all the evidence, you can\n17\ncandidly and honestly say that you are not satisfied with Ms. Maxwell's guilt as to any charge,\n18\nthat you do not have an abiding belief of her guilt as to that charge—in other words, if you have\n19\nsuch a doubt as would reasonably cause a prudent person to hesitate in acting in matters of\n20\nimportance in his or her own affairs—then you have a reasonable doubt, and in that circumstance\n21\nit is your duty to acquit Ms. Maxwell of that charge.\n13\nDOJ-OGR-00008634",
