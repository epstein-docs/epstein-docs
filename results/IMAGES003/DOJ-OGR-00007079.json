King. Provided that the rules for admitting prior inconsistent statements are satisfied, the Court concludes that this line of evidence is relevant and admissible. The defense may also cross-examine about witnesses' motives or biases for testifying, including, for example, the witnesses' motives for implicating Ms. Maxwell after Jeffrey Epstein's death. Admitting prior statements on cross-examination may require providing the jury some background information about the prior investigations so that the prior statements are understood in the proper context and the jury is provided necessary background to understand that evidence.
