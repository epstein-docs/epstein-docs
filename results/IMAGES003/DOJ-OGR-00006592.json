To the contrary, \"there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\"1 What's more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to validate Rocchio's opinions on \"grooming-by-proxy\"—i.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims not for her own benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio's opinions about \"grooming\" are entirely subjective—they are based on her personal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually abused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up her conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced; and they \"virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.\"2 Since \"expert\n\n1 Natalie Bennett & William O'Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J.
