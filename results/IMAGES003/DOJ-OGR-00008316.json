We've attempted to confer on this issue because the government has no idea what admissible testimony that attorney could possibly offer at this trial that would not be covered by attorney-client privilege. We would move to preclude it, but we cannot fathom what the testimony would be. And so we're raising it with your Honor\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
