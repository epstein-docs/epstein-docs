They're sent by the government to the MDC. THE COURT: Yes. But, specifically, what are you talking about? MS. STERNHEIM: 3500 material that we -- counsel received electronically the other day. THE COURT: And by the other day what do you mean, Ms. Sternheim? MS. STERNHEIM: It was Monday, Judge. She has still not received the production made by the government which I believe they send via federal express. THE COURT: So, Ms. Moe, the government made a 3500 production a week ago? MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government has been supplementing its 3500 productions on a rolling basis. I don't recall the exact date but we have been supplementing them and have made productions last week.
