The documents, all four of\n3 them -- the two questionnaires, the parties' and the Court's,\n4 as well as the voir dire questions -- contain references to\n5 this case, names of participants. Any person who is summoned\n6 for jury service, they likely connect their summons with any\n7 press coverage there may be with regards to the questionnaire\n8 and the jury voir dire questions and this case.\n9 Until the prospective jurors complete their\n10 questionnaires, they may read coverage, search the media. They\n11 are under no obligation or requirement to refrain from that,\n12 and we're concerned that that will further have a diluting\n13 effect on our ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. We\n14 have no problem whatsoever at the moment the jury is sworn,\n15 after peremptories have been exercised, that the Court place on\n16 the public record all of those documents. This is a procedure\n17 that we think can ensure a fair trial for both parties in light\n18 of extraordinary media coverage in this case.\n19 THE COURT: I need more specifics. You said\n20 references to this case, names of participants. The docket now\n21 and going forward, as more filings come in, is going to contain\n22 names related to this case, names of participants. All of that\n23 information is part of the docket in this case, to be sure.\n24 That's No. 1.
