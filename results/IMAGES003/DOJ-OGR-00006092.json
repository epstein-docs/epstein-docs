Richard J. Arcara in United States v. Vickers, 13 Cr. 128 (RJA) (W.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 708 F. App'x 732 (2d Cir. 2017); and the charge of the Hon. Thomas P. Greisa in United States v.

See United States v. Griffith, 284 F 3d 338, 350-51 (2d Cir 2002) However, Count Four charges Ms Maxwell with transporting a minor for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity under Section 1305 5 of the New York Penal Law Unlike prostitution, the age of the intended victim is a critical element of the underlying offense in Count Four - Ms Maxwell's conduct is not illegal unless Jane Doe-1 was under the age of consent in New York when the alleged sexual activity took place Accordingly, to be guilty of Count Four, the government must prove that Ms Maxwell knew that Jane Doe-1 was under 17 years old at the time of the acts alleged in Count Four. See Sand, Instr. 64-19. Comment (\"When the defendant is charged with transportation for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity, and the age of the victim is an element of that underlying offense, then there is good reason to require proof of age because that fact will often be the critical element which makes defendant's conduct illegal.\"). see also United States v. Murphy, 942 F 3d 73, 79-84 (2d Cir 2019) (holding under 18 U S C ยง 2423(b) that a defendant must know the age of the victim where the victim's age distinguishes lawful from unlawful conduct)\n\nCommented [RA(38B37]: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE: Because the defendant must intend to violate the New York state law, the instruction on the New York state law in Count Two requires the defendant to know that the relevant Minor Victim was under 17 at the time  That instruction is incorporated into the Count Four instructions, below Accordingly, the defense's proposal is redundant with the language in the New York state law instruction It is more accurate to include the knowledge requirement in the New York state law instruction, because that statute imposes the under-17 knowledge requirement Federal law otherwise only requires that the victim be under 18\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006092",
