  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 529 Filed 12/08/21 Page 10 of 18 10 LBF3MAXC protocols that you've just described. But has the Court made a determination with regard to whether we are sitting the week from Christmas to New Year's? Because I noticed on some of the individuals on your list, it appeared that they were people who might not be available that week. I'm just asking for some clarification. THE COURT: Yes. I think we do need to sit Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of that week. I think there were enough responses of folks who had travel beginning the 23rd, so the Thursday if I had that right. We will sit the 20th, 21st and 22nd. And I think I had been thinking to sit the 23rd as well, but I think there were enough individuals who we're bringing back who indicated that travel began then. So I think someone who has got travel beginning on the 23rd is not an issue. The 20th, 21st or 22nd wouldn't be an issue. MS. STERNHEIM: For the following week, are you following a similar is schedule? THE COURT: I think we can sit through Thursday. The way the holidays fall this year, I do think we have to use that time. So the 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th we'll sit. We won't sit the 31st, which is New Year's Eve. Any other questions about voir dire? MS. COMEY: No, your Honor. THE COURT: I'm not going to give rulings now, but to SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00008254",
