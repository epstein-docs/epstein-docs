MENNINGER: It relates to individuals in their 30s and 20s, your Honor. I'm just unclear how it relates to charged conduct or direct evidence of a conspiracy to abuse underage females. THE COURT: It seems like it falls within my -- it wasn't specifically moved for exclusion but because of the government not including it in its notice but I'm not seeing -- I am pulling it up but I'm not seeing -- a basis, from what I am hearing, distinguishing it from my ruling on the e-mails. MS. MODE: Your Honor, the government submits that along with other exhibits at trial, which will establish the defendant's role with respect to Mr. Epstein and her role in particular in setting up sexualized massages for him, that this is corroborative of other exhibits and other testimony at trial that the defendant did in fact serve that role, was willing to do -- take steps along those lines. And so, for that reason -- THE COURT: But it involves, clearly, people over the age of consent? MS. MODE: That's correct, your Honor. THE COURT: Let me just pull it up. For the same reasons, 416 is excluded. MS. MODE: Understood, your Honor. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007116",
