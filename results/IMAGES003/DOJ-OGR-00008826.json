App'x 75, 76 (2d Cir. 2018) (finding exhibits attached to a motion for a new trial \"determined the codefendant's substantive legal rights\" and were therefore judicial documents). Ms. Maxwell's motion for a new trial, and the exhibits attached to it, are judicial records, subject to a presumption of openness. Id.; see also Lugosch v.
