So, to the extent the government tries\n8 to suggest to the jury that they somehow had an adjudication,\n9 someone else found that their claims had merit, I think that\n10 would be confusing to the jury as well and I assume it would\n11 also be deemed by this Court to open the door to an explanation\n12 from the defense about what really happened in those\n13 proceedings.\n14 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.\n15 The government does not intend to elicit any testimony\n16 from the victims about being a prevailing party in any civil\n17 litigation or otherwise. To the extent the government elicits\n18 any testimony about civil litigation from the victims it would\n19 only be in order to front that issue for the jury in\n20 anticipation of cross-examination along those lines.\n21 THE COURT: Right.\n22 MS.
