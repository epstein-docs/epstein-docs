Should the defense prevail on this motion—and we believe the law and facts are clearly on our side—it would render all other post-trial motions moot. Ms. Maxwell should not have to expend precious time and resources briefing other motions when this motion can and should be dispositive. Accordingly, the defense respectfully requests that the Court set a briefing schedule for this motion alone and defer setting a briefing schedule for any other post-trial motions. Sincerely, /s/ Christian Everdell Christian R. Everdell COHEN & GRESSER LLP 800 Third Avenue, 21st Floor 2070301.1 DOJ-OGR-00008802",
