This is not to suggest that any witness who has an\n2 interest in the outcome of a case would testify falsely. It is for you to decide to what extent, if at\n3 all, the witness's interest has affected or colored his or her testimony.\n4 You have heard the testimony of a witness who was previously convicted of a crime,\n5 punishable by more than one year in jail. This prior conviction was put into evidence for you to\n6 consider in evaluating the witness' credibility. You may consider the fact that the witness who\n7 testified is a convicted felon in deciding how much of his or her testimony to accept and what\n8 weight, if any, it should be given.\n9 You are not required to accept testimony even though the testimony is not contradicted\n10 and the witness's testimony is not challenged. You may decide because of the witness's bearing\n11 or demeanor, or because of the inherent improbability of the testimony, or for other reasons\n12 sufficient to yourselves that the testimony is not worthy of belief. On the other hand, you may\n13 find, because of a witness's bearing and demeanor and based upon your consideration of all the\n14 other evidence in the case, that the witness is truthful.\n15 Thus, there is no magic formula by which you can evaluate testimony. You bring to this\n16 courtroom all your experience and common sense. You determine for yourselves in many\n17 circumstances the reliability of statements that are made by others to you and upon which you\n18 are asked to rely and act. You may use the same tests here that you use in your everyday lives.\n19 You may consider the interest of any witness in the outcome of this case and any bias or\n20 prejudice of any such witness, and this is true regardless of who called or questioned the witness.\n21 Finally, as you know, I have permitted certain witnesses to be referred to in open court\n22 either by their first name or a pseudonym.
