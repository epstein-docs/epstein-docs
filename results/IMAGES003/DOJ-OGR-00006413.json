The defendant further filed a motion for costs, demanding that Minor Victim-2 pay the defendant [REDACTED] in costs, because, by virtue of the dismissal, the defendant was technically the \"prevailing party.\" See [REDACTED] While Minor Victim-2 did \"not agree that the Defendant is the prevailing party,\" she agreed to pay the costs rather than engage in motion practice that would \"far exceed the above cost.\" [REDACTED]\nAt trial, the defense should be precluded from suggesting to the jury—during cross examination or otherwise—that the defendant prevailed in civil litigation.
