Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nFebruary 4, 2022\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's Order dated January 26, 2022, which provided that the Government \"may file on ECF\" a response to the defendant's letter filed on February 1, 2022 in which the defendant argued that her motion for a new trial (the \"Defense Motion\") and its exhibits should be sealed. (Dkt. No. 585). For the reasons discussed herein, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant has not justified her sealing request and, accordingly, the Defense Motion and its exhibits should be publicly docketed.\nIn examining whether there is a common law right of access to documents submitted to a court—and thus whether sealing is permissible—courts undertake a three-part inquiry. Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). First, a court must determine whether the record or document in question is a \"judicial document,\" that is, whether the document is \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,\" such that a presumption of access attaches. Id. at 119 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995)). Second, if a document is indeed a \"judicial document,\" the court must determine the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119. Finally, after\nDOJ-OGR-00008893",
