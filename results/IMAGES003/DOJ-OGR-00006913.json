Moreover, allowing the government to circumvent Rule 404(b) by charging \"other act\" evidence in the Indictment would swallow the rule and allow the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered for a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity.

The government further argues that evidence is necessary to \"complete the story\" of the charged offenses. Id. at 48-49.
