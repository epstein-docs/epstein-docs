It is for you to decide\n4\nwhether Ms. Maxwell engaged in the other conduct.\n5\nLet me remind you that Ms. Maxwell is on trial only for committing acts alleged in the\n6\nIndictment. Accordingly, you may not consider this evidence of similar acts as a substitute for\n7\nproof that Ms. Maxwell committed the crimes charged. Nor may you consider this evidence as\n8\nproof that Ms. Maxwell has a criminal personality or bad character. The evidence of the other,\n9\nsimilar acts was admitted for a much more limited purpose and you may consider it only for that\n10\nlimited purpose.\n11\nIf you determine that Ms. Maxwell committed the acts charged in the Indictment and the\n12\nsimilar acts as well, then you may, but you need not draw an inference that in doing the acts\n13\ncharged in the Indictment, that Ms. Maxwell acted knowingly and intentionally and not because\n14\nof some mistake, accident, or other innocent reasons. You may also consider this evidence in\n15\ndetermining whether Ms. Maxwell utilized a common scheme or plan in committing both the\n16\ncrimes charged in the Indictment and the similar acts introduced by the Government.\n17\nEvidence of similar acts may not be considered by you for any other purpose.\n18\nSpecifically, you may not consider it as evidence that Ms. Maxwell is of bad character or has the\n19\npropensity to commit crimes.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-00008688",
