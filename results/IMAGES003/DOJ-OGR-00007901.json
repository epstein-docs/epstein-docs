Attachment basically refers to the relationship between one person, one individual and another. The original research was conducted looking at the attachment as a connection between an infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded into talking about the relational dynamics between either children and caregivers, children and family members or, for example, two intimate partners as adults.\n3 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between attachment and grooming?\n4 A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that relationship within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the function and end result of that is to create a relationship or attachment and connection between the perpetrator and the child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the perpetrator.\n5 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you familiar with the term coercive control?\n6 A. I am.\n7 Q. What is coercive control?\n8 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic pattern of behavior that's designed to attain and maintain control in a relationship. So coercion means getting somebody to either do or not do something that they wouldn't ordinarily do otherwise.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00007901",
