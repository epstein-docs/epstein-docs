The crime of conspiracy to\n10 violate federal law is an independent offense. It is separate and distinct from the actual\n11 violation of any specific federal laws, which the law refers to as \"substantive crimes.\" Indeed,\n12 you may find Ms. Maxwell guilty of conspiring to violate federal law even if you find that the\n13 crime which was the object of the conspiracy was never actually committed.\n14 As I will explain, the three different conspiracy counts are separate offenses and each\n15 conspiracy alleges a different purpose, which I will describe to you shortly.\n40\nDOJ-OGR-00008747",
