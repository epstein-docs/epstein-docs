And again, we need 40 qualified jurors in light of the number of peremptories, but I'm hoping with this number and the time that we have that we can get to 50 to 60 qualified jurors. Any questions? MS. COMEY: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank you. MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, one briefly. Can I just inquire how you intend to conduct the sidebar in this courtroom, given the number of attorneys and so forth? THE COURT: Yes. So, I think it's going to have to be one attorney per side. And all of you are capable of operating on your own. So, if we are doing a sidebar with the juror, because they have private, confidential information they want to convey, then it will be me and the two attorneys and the court reporter with the juror. To the extent we are talking about any followup questions that you want me to ask, we'll go over here, and I'll still ask we limit it to one attorney per side. Okay? MS. MENNINGER: Thank you. THE COURT: Any other questions? MS. MENNINGER: No, thank you. THE COURT: Anything else about voir dire? MS. COMEY: Not from the government, your Honor. MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, this isn't actually about the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
