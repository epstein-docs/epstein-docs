  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 77 of 93\n\nExpert Testimony\n[If applicable]\nYou have heard testimony from a witness/certain witnesses who was/were proffered as (an) expert(s) in different areas. An expert is allowed to express his or her opinion on those matters about which he or she has special knowledge and training. Expert testimony is presented to you on the theory that someone who is experienced in the field can assist you in understanding the evidence or in reaching an independent decision on the facts.\nIn weighing an expert's testimony, you may consider the expert's qualifications, opinions, reasons for testifying, as well as all of the other considerations that ordinarily apply when you are deciding whether or not to believe a witness's testimony. You may give the expert testimony whatever weight, if any, you find it deserves in light of all the evidence in this case.\nYou should not, however, accept a witness's testimony merely because he or she is an expert. Nor should you substitute it for your own reason, judgment, and common sense. The determination of the facts in this case rests solely with you.\nAdapted from Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instr. 7-21; and the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United States v. Pizarro, 17 Cr. 151 (AJN).\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-00006143",
