Under our Constitution, a defendant has no obligation to testify or to present any evidence, because it is the Government's burden to prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. That burden remains with the Government throughout the entire trial and never shifts to a defendant. A defendant is never required to prove that she is innocent.\nYou may not attach any significance to the fact that Ms. Maxwell did not testify.\nNo adverse inference against Ms. Maxwell may be drawn by you because she did not take the witness stand. You may not consider this against Ms. Maxwell in any way in your deliberations in the jury room.",
