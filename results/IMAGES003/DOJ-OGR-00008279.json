She replied: \"The stolen document I have in front of me is what you are referring to.\" Id. Finally, when asked whether she had access to \"a hardcopy document that she could refer to to find someone's number,\" she replied that \"This is, I believe, the book that was stolen, that was the hardcopy of whatever was there.\" Id. at 317 (emphasis added).
