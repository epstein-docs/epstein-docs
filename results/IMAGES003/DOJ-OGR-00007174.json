STERNHEIM: I'm asking the Court to have the MDC retrieve its mail in a timely manner. I will notify them if a next-day delivery is on the way, and that it be picked up for next-day and not languish in the post office.\nTHE COURT: Ms. Moe?\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, we will confer with MDC legal about this issue and their practices and happy to provide the Court with additional information about our disclosures last week and the ongoing practices.\nI can't speak to the particular mail sorting practices of the MDC, but I want to assure the Court we have been working diligently with the defense and with MDC legal on this issue and have been taking extraordinary efforts to make sure the disclosures are produced promptly and that they're sent to the defendant quickly and we will continue to do so. And if we learn of a practical way of expediting this, we would certainly be open to exploring that but that's all the information that I have at this point.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
