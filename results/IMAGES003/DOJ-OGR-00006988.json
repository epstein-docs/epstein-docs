  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 459 Filed 11/15/21 Page 16 of 43 16 LalWmaxC that, the defense gets ten peremptories; the government gets six. As I said, I'll seat six alternates. Under the rule, that's three additional peremptories per side for the alternates. If my math is right, that adds up to 40. To have a cushion heading into peremptory challenges, it's my plan -- again, time dependent -- to try to qualify at least 50 jurors, somewhere in the 50 to 60 range. So then the question is do we have that panel of qualified jurors come back on the 19th and exercise peremptories, or do we have them come back on the 29th? Either way, I anticipate that once we have that panel of qualified jurors come back, I'd ask some very basic preliminary questions -- do any jurors wish to amend answers? Confirm that they've not read or researched about the case, we'd deal with any issues along those lines, and then the parties would exercise the peremptories and all the others would be excused. If we do that on the 19th and finish the process, I'd inform the 18 that they've been selected as jurors, remind them very clearly of all the instructions and restrictions that apply, and direct them to return on the morning of the 29th. On that date, I'd swear them in, give them standard preliminary instructions, and we head to openings, straight into opening statements. Alternatively, if we were to wait for that final SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00006988",
