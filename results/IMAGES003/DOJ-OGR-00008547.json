You, the\n3 members of the jury, are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts. You pass upon the weight of\n4 the evidence or lack of evidence; you determine the credibility of the witnesses; you resolve such\n5 conflicts as there may be in the testimony; and you draw whatever reasonable inferences you\n6 decide to draw solely based on the evidence and from the facts as you have determined them.\n7 You must determine the facts based solely on the evidence received in this trial.\n8 In determining the facts, you must rely upon your own recollections of the evidence.\n9 What the lawyers have said—for instance, in opening statements, in closing arguments, in\n10 objections, or in questions—is not evidence. You should bear in mind particularly that questions\n11 put to witnesses, although they can provide the context to answers, are not themselves evidence.\n12 It is only the answers that are evidence.\n13 I remind you also that nothing I have said during the trial or will say during these\n14 instructions is evidence. Similarly, the rulings I have made during the trial are not any indication\n15 of my views of what your decision should be.\n16 The evidence before you consists of the answers given by witnesses and the exhibits and\n17 stipulations that were received into evidence. If I have sustained an objection to a question or\n18 told you to disregard testimony, the answers given by a witness are no longer part of the\n19 evidence and may not be considered by you. I will instruct you at the end of these charges about\n20 your ability to request to have testimony read back and your access to other evidence admitted\n21 during the trial.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-00008547",
