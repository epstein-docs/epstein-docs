Mar. 30, 2020) (quoting 4 Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 702.03 (2019)); see also United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 2001) (explaining that “the district court should not admit testimony that is ‘directed solely to lay matters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert's help’” (quoting United States v. Castillo, 924 F.2d 1227, 1232 (2d Cir. 1991))). Dr. Rocchio's first and second opinions may assist the jury in understanding how a minor may be enticed, induced, or coerced into illegal sexual activity without physical force. These opinions may also assist a jury in assessing evidence that some alleged victims repeatedly interacted with Jeffrey Epstein, seemingly voluntarily, even after they suffered abuse. Dr. Rocchio's fourth opinion is similarly relevant to the charges that require proving intentional enticement or inducement. Dr. Rocchio's third and fifth opinions pertain to issues that will arise in the case based on anticipated cross-examination by the Defense. Specifically, the third opinion becomes relevant if the Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on their substance abuse. And the fifth opinion may become relevant if the Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on an ostensible delay in fully disclosing sexual abuse. At the Daubert hearing, the Defense stated that they intended to pursue both lines of impeachment at trial. Nov. 10 Tr. at 156–57. The Court therefore finds these elements of Dr. Rocchio's testimony relevant to matters the Defense intends to put in issue during anticipated cross-examination. The Court also concludes that these opinions satisfy the other relevant Daubert requirements. Namely, they would assist the jury in understanding concepts that require expert knowledge without directing the jury to reach any conclusion as to a witness's credibility. Additionally, both Dr. Rocchio's opinion about sexual abuse's connection to substance abuse and her opinion about delayed disclosure are “are outside the ken of the 8 DOJ-OGR-00006349",
