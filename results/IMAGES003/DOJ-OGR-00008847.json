Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's Order dated January 26, 2022 regarding the redaction of a witness's name in one court exhibit. (Dkt. No. 584). The Government does not seek to redact the last name of the witness who testified as Carolyn in Court Exhibit 2, because Carolyn publicly disclosed her full name in a post-trial interview with the Daily Mail, in which she identified herself as the witness who had testified under the name Carolyn at trial, and stated that she waived her right to anonymity. The Government notified Carolyn through her counsel that it intended to take this position and Carolyn's counsel has confirmed that Carolyn does not object to her last name being used in filings going forward. 1 DOJ-OGR-00008847",
