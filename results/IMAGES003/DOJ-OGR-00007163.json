  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 465 Filed 11/15/21 Page 112 of 127 112 LB15max4 here is length of trial and the timing of trial. I would like the parties, in light of -- you have gotten some rulings, obviously not everything yet -- to think about whether what we include in the questionnaire is still the six-week time frame that we have indicated. And if it is, it is, but if there is any basis to suggest a lower estimate as the parties have continued preparing their cases and in light of any rulings, I would certainly be open to hearing it if we could safely put a shorter time frame in the questionnaire. Again, maybe we can't. So I just ask you to think about it and confer and put in a letter by November 2nd, on ECF, indicating whether the parties agree that there should be any different estimate to the trial length than what we have indicated in the current draft of the questionnaire. I recognize that may change after that but for jury selection purposes it won't help us if a few days later we decide that we could say four weeks instead of six weeks. So you will let me know and I will ask the parties to confer. You don't need to put in specific reasons, just if you can put in a joint submission as to the parties' best overall estimate of length of trial is to see if it can be realistically any shorter than what is in the questionnaire to help facilitate jury selection. That's what I have. I will hear from counsel any other issues. Ms. Moe? MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor; very briefly on two SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007163",
