We are still working through the logistics. This piece helps. As I said, there are pros and cons to both, but I think that the safest course for proceeding with a full jury is to bring them back on the 29th -- I will give you my final resolution as to that when I have it -- but my thinking is we are in the courtroom, all of us. The panel, approximately 50 to 60 people who I will bring back are in two other courtrooms because we can't get them all in one place, with a video, in which I ask some very preliminary questions: Does anybody need to change any answers and has anybody had media exposure, etc. Hands raised. If anybody does raise their hands, we will have staff in each of those rooms who we can bring in one at a time to deal with.\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25 And assuming not, or once we deal with that, that's our panel,\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
