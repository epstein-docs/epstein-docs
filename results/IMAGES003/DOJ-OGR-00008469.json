Ms. Maxwell\nhas pleaded not guilty to the charges in the Indictment. As a result, the burden is on the\nGovernment to prove Ms. Maxwell's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to each charge. This\nburden never shifts to the Defendant for the simple reason that the law never imposes upon a\ndefendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of testifying, or calling any witness, or locating\nor producing any evidence. In other words, Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove her innocence.\nThis presumption of innocence was with Ms. Maxwell when the trial began and remains\nwith Ms. Maxwell unless and until you are convinced that the Government has proven her guilt\nbeyond a reasonable doubt as to each charge. Even though Ms. Maxwell has presented evidence\nin her defense, the presumption of innocence remains with her and it is not her burden to prove\nthat she is innocent. It is always the Government's burden to prove each of the elements of the\ncrimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\n12\nDOJ-OGR-00008469",
