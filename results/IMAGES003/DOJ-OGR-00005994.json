  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 398 Filed 10/29/21 Page 39 of 52 It was not until 2020, after making a multi-million dollar claim to the Epstein Victim Compensation fund, that the SDNY interviewed and then in 2021 showed her photos -- the majority of which were men or women much younger than Ms. Maxwell. Only two of the photos look anything like Ms. Maxwell and thought one was Ms. Maxwell and the other might be Ms. Maxwell. Of course, no one thought to ask if her lawyers had shown her photos of Ms. Maxwell as part of her multi-million-dollar request or if she had seen any of the many photographs displayed on the internet of Ms. Maxwell, including those published in relation to the first indictment by Acting U.S. Attorney Strauss's Rule 23.1-violative press conference, or any of the millions of photographs published in the wake of the Indictment. The photo array process was not recorded, and we do not know why certain photos in the array were selected or by whom. No one documented how long the photo array was viewed or any other relevant indicia of reliability. The claim that the show-up was merely a \"confirmatory identification\" of someone that had \"known and identified by name over the years\" is completely unsupported by the evidence. Tellingly, the government appends no supporting exhibit or declaration in support of this conclusory statement because it cannot. The truth of the matter is that had never identified Ms. Maxwell as someone who abused her and never claimed to have seen Ms. Maxwell prior to 2020 when it became economically prudent for her to do so. 33 DOJ-OGR-00005994",
