Each count charges the defendant Ms. Maxwell with a different crime. You must consider each count separately and return a separate verdict of guilty or not guilty for each. Whether you find the defendant Ms. Maxwell guilty or not guilty as to one offense should not affect your verdict as to any other offense charged, unless you are instructed otherwise. You may only find Ms. Maxwell guilty of a particular count if the government has proven each element of the offense charged with respect to that count beyond a reasonable doubt. With that summary of the Indictment as background, I will now give you detailed instructions that relate to the crimes charged in Counts One through Six. Adapted from the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United States v. Pizarro, 17 Cr. 151 (AJN) and in United States v. Le, 15 Cr. 38 (AJN). Commented [RA(16]: See response on page 6 17 DOJ-OGR-00006083",
