And contrary to the Defense's briefing, nothing in Dr. Dietz's expert notice contradicts this description of Dr. Rocchio's role in a clinical setting. He lists \"indices\" that \"professionals often use.\" Notice at 10. But Dr. Dietz does not say that psychologists in a clinical setting must use these indices to verify their patients' claims. On the forensic side, Dr. Rocchio takes on \"an investigative role\" and does not accept claims \"at face value.\" Nov. 10 Tr. at 15.

In explaining her method, Dr. Rocchio did not say that she \"base[s] her opinions\" on victims' emotional distress. Def. Br. at 14. Rather, she testified that she looks at a significant volume of documentation, conducts an 8 to 10-hour in-person evaluation, and \"conduct[s] collateral interviews with others.\" Nov. 10 Tr. at 37-38. And consistent with Dr. Dietz's opinion, Dr. Rocchio said that she looks \"for consistencies and inconsistencies in what the individual is telling [her] in order to form an opinion.\" Id. at 39.

Br. at 13.\nSecond, there is a significant risk of prejudice. As explained, expert testimony that evaluates witnesses' credibility is inadmissible. For example, the Second Circuit in Lumpkin affirmed the exclusion of an expert opinion that a witness's \"confidence in identification is not a good predictor of accuracy\" because it \"would effectively have inserted [the expert's] own view of the [testifying witness's] credibility for that of the jurors, thereby usurping their role.\" 192 F.3d at 288–89.
