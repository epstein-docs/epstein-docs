Mollo Building One Saint Andrew's Plaza New York, New York 10007 December 19, 2021 USDC SDNY DOCUMENT ELECTRONICALLY FILED DOC #: DATE FILED: 12/19/21 BY ECF The Honorable Alison J. Nathan United States District Court Southern District of New York United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, New York 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: The parties previously indicated to the Court that they did not intend to make the visuals of the closing argument presentations public. The Court accordingly ordered the parties to confer on a proposal so as to ensure public access. For the reasons provided by the parties, the Court adopts the parties' proposal. Versions of the closing argument visual presentations with narrowly tailored redactions (e.g., redactions to protect the anonymity of witnesses the Court has permitted to testify under pseudonyms) shall be made available to the public within two hours of the completion of closing arguments. SO ORDERED. The parties respectfully submit this letter regarding the logistics for public access for closing arguments. The parties propose that they will release a public version of their slides (to the extent they do not contain sealed materials) following the conclusion of the trial day on the same basis that they have been releasing public exhibits during trial. This proposal appropriately balances the public interest in access to closing arguments with the Court and the parties' interests in avoiding delay and effective advocacy on behalf of their clients, as well as the interests of victims and third parties protected by the Court's sealing orders.1 Closing argument demonstratives are not part of the official trial record. The approach jointly proposed by the parties is consistent with trials conducted without electronics, where the public would not be in a position to see white boards or easel displays positioned facing the jury box. 1 Alison J. Nathan 12/19/21 DOJ-OGR-00008448",
