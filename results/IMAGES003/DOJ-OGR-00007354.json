Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew's Plaza\nNew York, New York 10007\nNovember 19, 2021\nBY ECF\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n40 Foley Square\nNew York, New York 10007\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government, with consent of defense counsel, respectfully requests that the Court allow the parties to arrange for the provision of secure high-speed wired Internet access in the courtroom in connection with trial in the above-captioned matter. The secure Internet connection will enable the trial teams in the courtroom to stay connected to their online case repositories and resources during critical moments of the proceedings. This will facilitate the effective and efficient presentation of evidence. In addition, the parties will be able to reduce the files they bring into the courtroom, as well as the traffic to and from the courtroom during proceedings. Although the parties understand that the courtroom also has Wi-Fi access, which is available for use, a high-speed wired connection ensures a faster internet connection and will avoid connectivity issues.\nSubject to the Court's approval, the parties will retain Courtroom Connect to provide these services. Courtroom Connect does not require any court resources to provide service and currently maintains a network in the courthouse that is 100% independent of the Court's internal network. Set up, installation and service fees will be paid for by the parties at no cost to the Court.\nOther trials in federal courts have utilized a high-speed connection to the Internet in the courtroom, including United States v. Gatto, 17 Cr. 686 (LAK). The following describes how Courtroom Connect restricts access to the network and ensures compliance with court security and directives:\n- The network will be a hard-wired, secure physical network connection utilizing a firewall and other security provisions.\nDOJ-OGR-00007354",
