The phrase, \"transport an individual in interstate commerce\" means to move or carry,\n7 or cause someone to be moved or carried, from one state to another.\n8\n9 The Government does not have to prove that Ms. Maxwell personally transported Jane\n10 across a state line. It is sufficient to satisfy this element that Ms. Maxwell was actively engaged,\n11 either personally or through an agent, in the making of the travel arrangements, such as by\n12 purchasing tickets necessary for Jane to travel as planned.\n13\n14 Ms. Maxwell must have knowingly transported, or caused the transportation of, Jane in\n15 interstate commerce. This means that the Government must prove that Ms. Maxwell knew both\n16 that she was causing Jane to be transported, and that Jane was being transported in interstate\n17 commerce. As I have explained, an act is done knowingly when it is done voluntarily and\n18 intentionally and not because of accident, mistake or some innocent reason.\n19\n20 It is the Defendant's intent that matters here. If the Government establishes each of the\n21 elements of this crime beyond a reasonable doubt, then the Defendant is guilty of this charge\n22 whether or not the individual agreed or consented to cross state lines.\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\nDOJ-OGR-00008648",
