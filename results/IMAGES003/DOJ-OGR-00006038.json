The process that we use is designed to help us figure out\n3 whether you can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case.\n4 If during the course of this process you come to believe that because of something that\n5 you have experienced or because of something you've heard or read that you cannot be fair and\n6 impartial—that is that you would favor either the Government or the Defendant regardless of\n7 what the evidence shows—then you must tell me. It's not unusual, and there's no reason to be\n8 embarrassed about it.\n9 But the system only works if all of our citizens are willing and prepared to serve as jurors\n10 when they can do so fairly and impartially. I do not expect that anybody would seek to avoid this\n11 important duty for any but the most compelling reasons.\n12 As I mentioned in my prior remarks, the Court has taken a number of steps to help ensure\n13 the process for selected jurors is as safe and easy as possible. We have masking and distancing\n14 protocols. We have reconfigured courtrooms to enhance safety measures. The Court will\n15 provide transportation for selected jurors to and from the courthouse each day. Breakfast,\n16 snacks, and lunch will be provided for you.\n17 To conduct the next phase of the process, I will ask each of you some questions\n18 individually. We'll do that in a separate courtroom where I and the lawyers and the Defendant\n19 are sitting now. You all will be brought in the courtroom one at a time. Bear in mind that this is\n20 a public courtroom. To protect your privacy, I will only refer to you by your juror number.\n21 Please do not state any identifying information. For example, if we talk about your job you\n22 could say that you are a sales clerk at a large retail store, without stating the specific name of\n23 your employer. This is to protect your privacy.
