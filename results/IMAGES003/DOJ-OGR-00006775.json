If the defendant cannot make such a showing, \"the trial identification testimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial identification.

See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at 110-14. Instead, the court must then determine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless \"independently reliable\" based on the totality of the circumstances.
