Your verdict must be unanimous.\n3 If at any time you are divided, do not report how the vote stands, and if you have\n4 reached a verdict, do not report what it is until you are asked in open court.\n5 A verdict form has been prepared for your convenience. After you have reached your\n6 decision, your foreperson will fill in the form. At that point the foreperson should advise the\n7 marshal outside your door that you are ready to return to the courtroom.\n8 Finally, I say this not because I think it is necessary, but because it is the custom in this\n9 courthouse to say this: You should treat each other with courtesy and respect during your\n10 deliberations.\n11 In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that if you listen to the views of your\n12 fellow jurors, and if you apply your own common sense, you will deliberate fairly.\n13 Members of the jury, I ask your patience for a few minutes longer. It is necessary for me\n14 to spend a few moments with counsel and the reporter at the side bar. I will ask you to remain\n15 patiently in the jury box, without speaking to each other, and we will return in just a moment to\n16 submit the case to you. Thank you.\n80\nDOJ-OGR-00008701",
