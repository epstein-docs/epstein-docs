As noted above, courts have frequently admitted testimony about the psychological relationship between victims of sexual abuse and their perpetrators. See supra pp. 7-8. Courts have also specifically authorized expert testimony on the subject of grooming. See, e.g., United States v. Telles, 6 F.4th 1086, 1097-1098 (9th Cir. 2021) (holding that admission of expert testimony on grooming did not violate Federal Rules of Evidence 702 or 403 nor violate due process and finding that the expert \"'merely gave a straightforward account of relevant background information based on [the expert's] own knowledge and experience'\" (quoting United States v. Johnson, 860 F.3d 1133, 1141 (8th Cir. 2017))); United States v. Halamek, 5 F.4th 1081, 1087-89 (9th Cir. 2021) (holding that expert testimony on grooming was \"relevant, reliable, and properly admitted\"); United States v. Isabella, 918 F.3d 816, 833 n.15 (10th Cir. 2019) (\"Grooming can be established by use of an expert witness who testifies about psychological tactics that are common in cases of child sex abuse.\"); United States v. Hitt, 473 F.3d 146, 158 (5th Cir. 2006) (affirming expert testimony on the \"grooming process\"); Morris v. State, 361 S.W.3d 649, 656-69 (Tx. Ct. Crim.
