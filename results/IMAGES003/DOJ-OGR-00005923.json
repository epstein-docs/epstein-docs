(continued) Study | Purpose | Design | Sample | Findings | Summary Hershkovitz and Lamb (2005) | To identify characteristics of suspected child abuse victims that are associated with disclosure during interviews | Large database of suspected cases of child abuse between 1998 and 2002 was analyzed. Interviews using standardized NICHD Protocol were conducted. Interview data were analyzed. | The sample comprised 26,446 children aged 3- to 14-years-old. 65% of the 26,446 children reported sexual abuse and physical abuse was reported in 6% of cases. Analyses only involved cases that had come to the attention of the agency making the referral. Disclosure rates increased 1- to 5-year-olds: 50% to 67%; 6- to 10-year-olds: 67% to 74%; and 11- to 14-year-olds: 74% disclosed abuse when questioned. None of the children were asked about physical abuse. Evidence for delayed disclosure was found. The results indicate that disclosure is a fundamental process that becomes more difficult the longer it is delayed. Children first told a family member. Shorter delay was more likely when the perpetrator was a family member. Over 90% of the 26,446 children made key findings of disclosure. Rates of disclosure varied systematically depending on the nature of the alleged offenses and the relationship between the victim and the suspected perpetrator. Children aged 3- to 6-years-old were less likely to disclose abuse during a forensic interview. Disclosure rates grew with age. | Generalizability of this study is limited by the fact that the sample was comprised of children who were referred for assessment referred through a police report. Overall findings indicate that rates of disclosure vary systematically depending on the nature of the alleged offenses and the relationship between the victim and the suspected perpetrator. Analyses only involved cases that had come to the attention of the agency making the referral. Disclosure rates increased 1- to 5-year-olds: 50% to 67%; 6- to 10-year-olds: 67% to 74%; and 11- to 14-year-olds: 74% disclosed abuse when questioned.

The results indicate that disclosure is a fundamental process that becomes more difficult the longer it is delayed. Children first told a family member. Shorter delay was more likely when the perpetrator was a family member. Strengthening parent-child relationships is an important practice when the child's experiences are taken into account. Jensen, Jørundsen, Mossige, and Tjersland (2005) | To study how children and parents were able to report their experiences in the context of an interview which dated back to what made them talk about sexual abuse experiences; the reactions of the parents; and what the parents and children perceived as helpful in the disclosure process. | Qualitative approach to data collection was used. Therapeutic conversations were analyzed through a tentative approach. | 20 families were interviewed 22 times in total. 3-4 participants in each family were interviewed. Children and parents were interviewed separately. Follow-up interviews were held 1 year after the initial interviews. | The study involved 20 families with a total of 22 children. Children aged 3-15 years (average age 7.5 years) and 16 adults participated. Sexually abused children felt it was difficult to share their experiences with someone in the family or close relative. When the child's experiences were taken into account, a purpose to talk, a connection on what they are talking about, and strengthening parent-child relationships is an important practice when the child's experiences are taken into account. | DOJ-OGR-00005923 271",
