Evidence consists only of the testimony of\nwitnesses, documents and other things admitted as evidence, or stipulations agreed\nto by the parties. Some of you probably have heard the terms \"circumstantial\nevidence\" and \"direct evidence.\" Do not be concerned with these terms. You are\nto consider all the evidence given in this trial.\n\nCertain things are not evidence and must not be considered by you. The\nfollowing is a list of what is not evidence:\n\nFirst, arguments, statements, and questions by the lawyers are not evidence.\nNor are statements I make or questions I ask of a witness.\n\nSecond, objections to questions are not evidence. The lawyers have an\nobligation to make an objection when they believe evidence being offered is\nimproper under the rules of evidence. You should not be influenced by the\nobjection or by my rulings on them. If the objection is sustained, ignore the\nquestion and any answer that may have been given. If it is overruled, treat the\nanswer like any other. If you are instructed that some item of evidence is received\nfor a limited purpose only, you must follow that instruction.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-00007457",
