The fact that a witness may be employed by the Federal Government as a law enforcement official or employee does not mean that his or her testimony is necessarily deserving of more or less consideration or greater or lesser weight than that of an ordinary witness.\n\nIn this context, defense counsel is allowed to try to attack the credibility of such a witness on the ground that his or her testimony may be colored by a personal or professional interest in the outcome of the case.\n\nIt is your decision, after reviewing all the evidence, whether to accept the testimony of the law enforcement or Government employee witness and to give to that testimony the weight you find it deserves.\n\nAdapted from Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instr. 7-16; and the charge of the Hon.
