Aiding and abetting\n4 liability is its own theory of criminal liability. In effect, it is a theory of liability that permits a\n5 defendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself committing the\n6 crime, assisted another person or persons in committing the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and\n7 Six, therefore, the Defendant can be convicted either if she committed the crime herself, or if\n8 another person committed the crime and the Defendant aided and abetted that person to commit\n9 that crime.\n10 Under the federal aiding and abetting statute, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands,\n11 induces, or procures” the commission of an offense is punishable as a principal. You should give\n12 those words their ordinary meaning. A person aids or abets a crime if she knowingly does some\n13 act for the purpose of aiding or encouraging the commission of that crime, with the intention of\n14 causing the crime charged to be committed. To “counsel” means to give advice or recommend.\n15 To “induce” means to lead or move by persuasion or influence as to some action or state of\n16 mind. To “procure” means to bring about by unscrupulous or indirect means. To “cause” means\n17 to bring something about, to effect something.\n18 In other words, it is not necessary for the Government to show that Ms. Maxwell herself\n19 physically committed the crime charged in order for you to find her guilty. This is because a\n20 person who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of a crime is\n21 just as guilty of that offense as if she committed it herself.
