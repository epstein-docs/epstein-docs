STERNHEIM: Your Honor, at this point do we know\n3 how many jurors will be summoned and how many the Court is\n4 planning to select for the final voir dire?\n5 THE COURT: Yes. What I can tell you -- and again, I\n6 just want to say an enormous thanks to the jury department, who\n7 I've been working with closely on this for months, as you can\n8 imagine. The return rate in the Covid era has gone up and down\n9 on summonses, but we have estimated our ability to administer\n10 the questionnaire over the three days in a morning and\n11 afternoon panel each day; the goal was 600 jurors, if we need\n12 it.\n13 That's the answer to question one.\n14 Question two I was going to get to the exercise of\n15 peremptories in a moment.\n16 I'm sorry. Maybe I misunderstood.\n17 What was question No. 2, Ms. Sternheim?\n18 MS. STERNHEIM: It was how many you are going to\n19 ultimately have us select to sit.\n20 THE COURT: Yes. OK. I thought I had that in a prior\n21 order, but my intention is to sit six alternates, so we'll have\n22 a jury of 18.\n23 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.\n24 THE COURT: OK.
