Kimba M. Wood in United States v. Almonte, 16 Cr. 670 (KMW); and the charge of the Hon. Denise L. Cote in United States v. Purcell, 18 Cr. 081 (DLC).\nCommented [CE63]: The modified language and the additional element are consistent with Sand and the Court's recent instructions on this issue. See Sand, Instr. 19-3; United States v. Pizarro, 17 Cr 151 (AJN)\nCommented [RA64R63]: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE: The Government needs to prove that a member of the conspiracy committed an overt act, but it need not be an overt act charged in the Indictment See, e.g., United States v. Salomonse, 352 F 3d 609, 619 (2d Cir 2003) (describing \"the well-established rule of this and other circuits that the overt act element of a conspiracy charge may be satisfied by an overt act that is not specified in the indictment, at least so long there is no prejudice to the defendant\"). Accordingly, it is not an element of the offense that the defendant knowingly committed \"at least one of the overt acts charged in the particular count of the Indictment\"\nDOJ-OGR-00006112",
