(continued) Study Purpose Design Sample questionnaire for childhood abuse characteristics and the disclosure. Children reported the character of abuse and their disclosure, perception of response and fear consequences were probed. Correlation analyses were conducted with path analyses to test the hypothesized causal relations among variables. The study focus was to gather data from a large sample of women about the extent of childhood sexual abuse, the age at first rape, and the time elapsed since the last rape. Two probability samples. Wave 1 = 2,009 respondents selected from a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) sample of approximately 35 minutes. Random digit dialing was used to contact potential respondents. A juror questionnaire was used to screen for women who were sexually assaulted before age 18 and who reported disclosure to at least one person. The telephone interview was conducted on a computer screen. The survey consisted of several measures designed to assess disclosure and the number of persons to whom disclosure was made. Both Wave 1 and Wave 2 data were collected. Wave 2 respondents were selected from the ages of 18 and 34 and were given a confidential status in 1989. Census statistics were used to compare the demographic characteristics of the sample to the U.S. population. The present study reports on data from the demographic and child rape victimization questions. Smith, LeTourneau, Saunders, K. Patrick, Resnick, and Best (2000) Summary Findings negative consequences to disclosure who took longer to disclose. We designed a study with high eve of disclosure for further mode of disclosure for further negative consequences to disclosure. However, researchers were not able to interview children who feared negative consequences to others took longer to disclose. Children who brought harm, fear of negative consequences to the self or perpetrators were unrelated to time of disclosure. (4) Perceived negative consequences to others took longer to disclose. The time frame of this survey may have had contextual influences on the major types of comparisons reported by the sample. Of the 288 women who reported n assault during the average length of time since the first rape was 10.9 years. The 288 women stated that they had told no one about the sexual assault at the time of the interview, 58% did not tell anyone within 5 years post-assault, and 27% disclosed to no one for over a year. At the time of the interview, women who disclosed to e phone were more likely to have been influenced by CSA (and should be disclosed to) response bias and may currently be influencing young women's disclosure patterns. For Wave 1, compared to the U.S. Census Bureau, the sample matched the demographic characteristics of the U.S. women population. Fewer than 10% of victims reported making or awareness of someone else's disclosure. Only 12% of child rape victims stated that the rape victimization author at some point LIM = long interview method; CSA = child sexual abuse; NCHD = National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; QIS = Questionnaire Informatique sur les Aggressions Sexuelles; NWS = National Women's Study; DSA = National Survey of Adolescents; SES = socioeconomic status",
