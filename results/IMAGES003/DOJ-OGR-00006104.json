It is also not required that the person actually performed a commercial sex act as long as the Government has proved that the defendant recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained the person for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex acts.\n\nAdapted from Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instr. 47A-22; 18 U.S.C. ยง 1591(c)(1) (2000) (defining \"commercial sex act\"); and the charge given by the Hon.
