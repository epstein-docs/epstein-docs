By disagreeing with the substance, the witness has logically and necessarily denied making the statement (or failed to remember making the statement).\nThus, under Rule 613, the statement is inconsistent because it has \"under any rational theory it might lead to any relevant conclusion different from any other relevant conclusion resulting from anything the witness said.\" United States v.
