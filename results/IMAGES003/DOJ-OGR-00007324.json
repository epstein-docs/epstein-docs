PAGLIUCA: Yes. 4 I guess the other point, your Honor, which I can develop, is, these studies that are included and impact the statistics are really not relevant here because they deal with males or a combination of males and females, and there are only a few of them that deal with females specifically. 5 THE COURT: OK. 6 MR. PAGLIUCA: So when we're conflating these things, it conflates the numbers. 7 May I proceed, your Honor? 8 THE COURT: You may. 9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Thank you. 10 Q.

But I -- there's no way I can read that. 14 THE COURT: I can't read it either. 15 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00007324",
