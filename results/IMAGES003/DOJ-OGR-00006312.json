NATHAN, District Judge:\nAttached is the Court's revised draft preliminary remarks to be recorded and played before each voir dire session. The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter approving of the remarks, Dkt. No. 420, and the Defendant's proposed additions, Dkt. No. 419. The revised remarks adopt all but one of the Defendant's proposals because the Court's subsequent revisions eliminated that portion of the script. In particular, the Court has made three additional changes in order to accurately explain the logistics of voir dire. Each of these changes is reflected in redline.\nThe parties are ORDERED to indicate by letter on or before November 11, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. whether or not they have any objections or suggestions the Court's revised preliminary remarks to be played before each voir dire session.\nAttached is also the Court's revised draft voir dire in redline. The Court's revisions simplify the phrasing of questions 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 25, and 37 in an effort to maximize the time dedicated to questioning each prospective juror. The revision to question 11 reflects the Court's oral ruling on November 1, 2021 regarding the use of pseudonyms for certain witnesses. The revisions to questions 9, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, and 33 are non-substantive changes to question\n1\nDOJ-OGR-00006312",
