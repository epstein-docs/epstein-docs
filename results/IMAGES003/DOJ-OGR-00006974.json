This is Judge Nathan. 2 We are here for a pretrial conference in this matter. 3 The case is scheduled to commence the jury selection process on November 4, trial to commence on November 29. 4 The primary purpose of today's conference is to go over jury selection matters and logistics. I'll also address the request to seal the proposed questionnaire and voir dire submitted by the parties, as I indicated I would in my order docketed yesterday. 5 As a preliminary matter, let me note that we are proceeding telephonically today. Counsel, my view is that, under Rule 43, we need not be in person with Ms. Maxwell present for today's proceeding. We do have Ms. Maxwell on the phone, of course. I do want to make sure counsel agree with that view and have no objection to proceeding remotely by phone conference today. 6 Ms. Pomerantz. 7 MS. POMERANTZ: The government has no objection, your Honor. 8 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim. 9 MS. STERNHEIM: The defense has no objection. Thank you. 10 THE COURT: OK. Thank you. 11 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00006974",
