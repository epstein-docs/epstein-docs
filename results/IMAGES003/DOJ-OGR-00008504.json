You may consider this\n2 evidence in determining whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt Ms.\n3 Maxwell's knowledge of the unlawful purposes of the conspiracy.\n4 It is for you to determine whether the Government has established beyond a reasonable\n5 doubt that such knowledge and intent on the part of Ms. Maxwell existed. It is important for you\n6 to know that Ms. Maxwell's participation in the conspiracy must be established by independent\n7 evidence of her own acts or statements, as well as those of the other alleged co-conspirators, and\n8 the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence.\n9 It is not necessary for the Government to show that Ms. Maxwell was fully informed as\n10 to all the details of the conspiracy in order for you to infer knowledge on her part. To have\n11 guilty knowledge, Ms. Maxwell need not have known the full extent of the conspiracy or all of\n12 the activities of all of its participants. It is not even necessary for a defendant to know every\n13 other member of the conspiracy.\n14 In addition, the duration and extent of Ms. Maxwell's participation has no bearing on the\n15 issue of her guilt. She need not have joined the conspiracy at the outset. Ms. Maxwell may have\n16 joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress, and she will be held responsible for all that\n17 was done before she joined and all that was done during the conspiracy's existence while she\n18 was a member. Each member of a conspiracy may perform separate and distinct acts and may\n19 perform them at different times. Indeed, a single act may be enough to bring one within the\n20 membership of the conspiracy, provided that Ms. Maxwell was aware of the conspiracy and\n21 knowingly associated herself with its criminal aims. It does not matter whether Ms. Maxwell's\n22 role in the conspiracy may have been more limited than or different in nature or in length of time\n23 from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was herself a participant.\n47\nDOJ-OGR-00008504",
