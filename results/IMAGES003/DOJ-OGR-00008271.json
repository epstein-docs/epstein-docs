Nathan\nDecember 8, 2021\nPage 7\nfaulted for pursuing a line of cross-examination that took the government at its word regarding its theory of admissibility and relevance and its plan to call Employee-1 as a witness to lay the required foundation.\nCONCLUSION\nThe government will rest either tomorrow or Friday, and it is long past time for the government to have presented evidence to authenticate Exhibit 52 and to lay the foundation for its admission. Because the government has not met its burden, this Court should exclude Exhibit 52, a book Mr. Alessi was unable to identify or authenticate, a book Ms. Maxwell was never shown during her deposition, and a book that was stolen and missing for several years, offered for sale in an extortion scheme and altered in untold ways.\nThis Court should reaffirm its decision not to admit Exhibit 52.\nDOJ-OGR-00008271",
