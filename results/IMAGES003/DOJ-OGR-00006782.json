Maxwell civil litigation . . . with no explanation about its origin.\" (Def. Mot. 7 at 1). The defendant misidentifies the exhibit. Government Exhibit 52 is a physical contact book belonging to the defendant. The records attached by the defense as Exhibit 1 appear to be a scan of Government Exhibit 52 that was produced in discovery in Giuffre v. Maxwell. But the Government will not offer that scan at trial. It will offer the physical book itself, along with scans taken by the Government of the physical book.

The defendant is correct that the Government came into custody of this exhibit after a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein attempted to sell it to a civil lawyer suing Epstein. (Id.). The defense calls this \"particularly troubling\" (Def. Mot. 7 at 2), but that argument is misplaced. How the Government acquired the exhibit goes, if anything, to its weight and not its admissibility.
