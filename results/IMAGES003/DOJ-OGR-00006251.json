First, the defense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no associated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 1, 7, 8, 12, 15; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor Dr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she describes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the literature, but she does not specify how often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7–8, 10, 16 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’ without providing the jury any explanation of how to decide whether grooming actually occurred in this case.”)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at 1 (“[Dr. Loftus] will describe scientific research showing that false memories can be described with confidence, detail, and emotion, just like true memories.”) (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of sexual assault do occur . . . .”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory and disclosure of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 17). That opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of post-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily cramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s view of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s arguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-00006251",
