Arroyo, 600 F. App'x 11, 13 (2d Cir. 2015) (summary order) (quoting United States v. LaFlam, 369 F.3d 153, 156 (2d Cir. 2004).

The Emails Bear No Relationship to the Charged Conspiracy, Reflect Pure Propensity Evidence, and Otherwise are Unduly Prejudicial to Uninvolved Third-Party Adults\n\nThe government's argument for admissibility of the Emails2 is breathtaking in its claims and unsupported by admissible evidence. Without expert testimony or even bothering to interview the Emails' recipients, the government contends the Emails represent \"direct evidence\" of a conspiracy (to recruit, groom, and sexually abuse minor females or to entice, transport or traffic them for Jeffrey Epstein's sexual pleasure) that Ms. Maxwell offered on two isolated occasions to arrange adult female dates for adult men completely uninvolved in this case.
