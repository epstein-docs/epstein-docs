Dr. Hall's \"fact testimony.\"\nAs Dr. Hall's report makes clear, never disclosed any abuse by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Then, when interviewed for 6 ½ hours by Dr. Hall. claimed to have been abused by Mr. Epstein, but she did not allege any abuse or improper conduct by Ms. Maxwell. This evidence is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.\nTo the extent the government claims failure ever to implicate Ms. Maxwell to or Dr. Hall is not \"inconsistent enough,\" that argument goes to weight, not admissibility.
