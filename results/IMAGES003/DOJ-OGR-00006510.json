AK's takeaway was that there was a large and potentially complicated record of civil litigation that would have to be at some point parsed through in assessing what any potential witness had said. It wasn't only that there was civil litigation involving Virginia, but there was also some person in Europe involved in litigation. AK felt this was a situation where there would be a lot of material to gather and read before talking to witnesses.\nAK doesn't remember being told any specific allegations victims had made against Maxwell. AK generally remembers Maxwell being mentioned as someone who had worked for Epstein.\nNotes reflect that Maxwell was \"head recruiter,\" but AK does not recall that description being attributed to any particular witness\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_02742888\nDOJ-OGR-00006510",
