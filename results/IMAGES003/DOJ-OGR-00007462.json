This is critically important to ensuring\n2 a fair trial - which I know that all of you would want if you were a party in this\n3 Court and I have no doubt is what you want for the parties who are here today. I\n4 expect you to inform me immediately through Ms. Williams if you become aware\n5 of another juror's violation of these instructions.\n6 Finally, each of you has been given a notebook and pen. That is because I\n7 permit jurors to take notes. But you do not have to take notes. Notes are just an\n8 aid to your own recollection. The court reporters in this case record everything\n9 that is said in the courtroom and any portion of the testimony can be read back to\n10 you during your deliberations. If you do take notes, be aware that note-taking may\n11 distract you from something important that is happening on the witness stand.\n12 Whether or not you take notes, rely on your own recollections, and don't be\n13 influenced by the fact that another juror has taken notes. If you do take notes, all\n14 notes must be left each day in the jury room. Ms. Williams will make sure that\n15 they are secure.\n16 From this point until the time when you retire to deliberate, it is your duty\n17 not to discuss this case with anyone and not to remain in the presence of other\n18 persons who may be discussing this case-this includes discussions even with\n19 members of your own family, and your friends. In this regard, please understand\n20 that the parties and counsel in this case have been instructed to have no contact\n9\nDOJ-OGR-00007462",
