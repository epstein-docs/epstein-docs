THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE THE TESTIMONY OF BENNETT GERSHMAN\n\nThe defense proposes to call Bennett Gershman, a professor of law at Pace University, for the following testimony:\n\nWe expect Professor Gershman to provide testimony on best practices to ensure the integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact, neutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their counsel, and case-related civil litigation.\n\n(Ex.
