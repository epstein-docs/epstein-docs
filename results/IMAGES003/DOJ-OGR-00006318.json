That's why if you're selected as a juror, I'll be reminding you of these rules\n6 regularly. You can't watch news accounts, look anything up or speak to anybody else about the\n7 case. You would be violating the oath you have taken as jurors and you would be violating my\n8 orders if you were to do that.\n9 Finally, you must report to me through my court deputy any effort by any person to speak\n10 with you about the case or to influence you about the case or to get information about the case.\n11 The attorneys and their assistants have been instructed by me not to speak to you or otherwise\n12 engage with you. They are not being rude or indifferent. They are merely following my\n13 instructions.\n14 I do want to thank all of you for the time you've invested already in this process. Our\n15 system cannot function unless we have good people like you who are willing to give up their\n16 time and to serve as jurors.\n17 Please sit quietly until your number is called and you are brought into the courtroom for\n18 questioning by me. Please follow all the instructions of the courtroom staff. Although you may\n19 use your electronic devices while you are waiting (bearing in mind of course all of my\n20 instructions that forbid you to do any research or engage in any communications about the case\n21 through any means), you must turn off and hand over any electronic devices to the Jury\n22 Department staff before you are brought into the courtroom.-I look forward to meeting each of\n23 you in person soon. Thank you.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-00006318",
