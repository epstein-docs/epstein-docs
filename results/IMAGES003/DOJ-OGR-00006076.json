Also, do not allow yourself to be influenced by personal likes or dislikes, sympathy, prejudice, fear, public opinion, or biases, including unconscious biases. Unconscious biases are stereotypes, attitudes, or preferences that people may consciously reject but may be expressed without conscious awareness, control, or intention. Like conscious bias, unconscious bias can affect how we evaluate information and make decisions.\n\nAdapted from the charge of the Honorable Alison J. Nathan in United States v. Berry, 20 CR 84 (AJN)\n\nCommented [CES]: The defense believes this instruction is appropriate to address any potential juror bias against Ms Maxwell due to the nature of the charges, public opinion against her, and/or her family background\n\nCommented [RA(6R5]: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE: While the Government does not object to the implicit bias instruction used in Berry, this instruction is otherwise largely redundant of the Improper Considerations instruction above, and the Government would combine the two\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006076",
