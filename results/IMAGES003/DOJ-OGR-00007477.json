The likely importance of her testimony to the government's case cannot be overstated.4 Dr. Dietz, who the government admits is supremely qualified, should be allowed to challenge the reliability of Dr. Rocchio's opinions, explain why they lack support, and opine about their limits.

Hindsight Bias.\n\nThe government appears to have two objections about Dr. Dietz's opinions on hindsight bias: First, that the testimony improperly attempts to inform the jury what result to reach, and second that the testimony is \"well within the ken of the average juror.\" Mot. at 13-14. The government does not dispute the reliability of Dr. Dietz's opinions, and as explained below, Dr. Dietz's testimony is independently relevant and relevant in response to Dr. Rocchio's testimony.\n\nThe government's first argument once again misunderstands Dr. Dietz's point. Dr. Dietz's opinion is about grooming. In his expert opinion, and at most, behavior can be labeled \"grooming\" only after the fact and retrospectively—that is, only after it is clear abuse occurred. Ex. 1, p 4-5. But the government's burden in this case is to prove that, at the time the abuse allegedly occurred, Ms. Maxwell knew about it and intended to facilitate it.
