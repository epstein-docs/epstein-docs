The lawyers' arguments are intended to convince you to draw\n6 certain conclusions from the evidence or lack of evidence. Those arguments are important. You\n7 should weigh and evaluate them carefully. But you must not confuse them with the evidence. If\n8 your recollection of the evidence differs from the statements of the lawyers, follow your\n9 recollection.\n10 You should draw no inference or conclusion for or against any party by reason of lawyers\n11 making objections or my rulings on such objections. Counsel have not only the right but the duty\n12 to make legal objections that they think are appropriate. You should not be swayed against the\n13 Government or the Defendant simply because counsel for either side has chosen to make an\n14 objection. Similarly, statements made by counsel when arguing the admissibility of evidence are\n15 not to be considered as evidence.\n16 If I comment on the evidence during my instructions, do not accept my statements in\n17 place of your recollection. Again, it is your recollection that governs.\n18 Do not concern yourself with what was said at side bar conferences or during my\n19 discussions with counsel. Those discussions related to rulings of law, which are my duty, and not\n20 to matters of fact, which are your duty to determine.\n21 At times I may have admonished a witness or directed a witness to be responsive to\n22 questions, to keep his or her voice up, or to repeat an answer. My instructions were intended only\n23 to clarify the presentation of evidence. You should draw no inference or conclusion of any kind,\n24 favorable or unfavorable, with respect to any witness or party in the case, by reason of any\n8\nDOJ-OGR-00008629",
