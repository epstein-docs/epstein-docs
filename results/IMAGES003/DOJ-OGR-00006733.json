  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 452 Filed 11/12/21 Page 25 of 84\n\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including substance use and participation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged exposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by trusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various psychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in relationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with the consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these psychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet that information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of Minor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other difficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government expects the defense to attack the credibility of a Minor Victim by cross0-examining her about her substance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by showing that substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain psychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is evidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered known consequences of such abuse.
