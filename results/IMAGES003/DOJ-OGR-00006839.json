Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosure Studies: 2000-2016 Study Purpose of Disclosure (CSA) Design Sample Findings Summary Gagner and Co Ventura (2016) To explore disclosure processes for male victims of CSA Phenomenological method used to interview male CSA survivors. Interview (LIM) guided data collection and analysis. 17 men ranged in age from 19 to 67, average age 47. Purposive sampling strategy was used  The majority of the men in the study had disclosed and received services before. Member checking was used to control for negative delayed disclosure. Negative disclosure was associated with stereotyping. Negative disclosure butted to be forgotten. Both disclosure and non-disclosure was cited as a motivator for further inquiry. Other issues such as negative trustworthiness of the data and contextual issues were noted. Socio-cultural stereotyping of male sexuality, linking disclosure to forms of media on disclosure, and a retrospective study and analysis of CSA disclosure were important One of the few studies to focus exclusively on African American women. Small sample size but sufficient to bring forward cultural and contextual issues. Retrospective study that may have been affected by recall bias. Use of a fe-course perspective as a theoretical framework throughout the study. 17 African Canadian women in mid-life between 40 and 63 experienced CSA, ntrafficking, and snowboarding strategy 17 Afr can women n m d-life between 40 and 63 exper enced ntraff ck ng and sn wba ng Purpos ve strategy CSA onset was noted at ages 5 and 9. One never talked to them about sex; one didn't understand the language or breakdown or removal of family name. Barr's fear of tarnishing the family name was not wanting to by family members felt but not by family members felt. Pattern of self-disclosure identified. 17 participants identified disclosure as a primary source of strength throughout the court process. Half of the participants had disclosed CSA experiences before the age of 19. Three broad categories were identified as barriers to CSA disclosure: barriers from female and male survivors (76%); barriers from family and friends (24%); and barriers from professionals. 67 male and female CSA adult survivors were identified as having CSA experiences from 9 to 69 years (M = 44.9) ranges from 9 to 69 years. Purposive sampling strategy Qualitative design using LIM. To provide a mapping of factors that prevent CSA disclosures through a sample of CSA adult survivors. 369 adult male sexual offenders were convicted of a sexual offense; the offense age increased with the age of the offender at the time of the offense. Disclosure was related to the offender's cognitive distortions - if the offender was not living with the offender at the time of the offense, the disclosure was not associated with the offender's cognitive distortions. Adult male child sexual offenders were interviewed to examine predictors of CSA disclosures (continued) 262",
