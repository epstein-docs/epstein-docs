So, as I say, I am still working through the specific logistics of that but that's my thinking as to how we will do it. Any reactions, Ms. Moe? MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim? MS. STERNHEIM: Yes. My only reaction is are we going to be able to see the jurors as they respond to the Court's questioning? THE COURT: So, I think what we can do is have staff in each of the courtrooms, I will ask my question, anyone who raises their hand will be brought in individually. If you would like to have someone in each of those rooms for the hand-raising, that's fine with me. MS. STERNHEIM: OK. THE COURT: We would be happy to do that. MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you. THE COURT: But because there are other trials being selected on the 29th we can't use the jury assembly room and, in any event, it would slow us down. So I think this is the way to go logistically but that's what it will entail for the exercised peremptories. MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.
