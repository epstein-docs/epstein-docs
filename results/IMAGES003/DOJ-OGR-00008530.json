Such consultation helps conserve your time and the Court's\n10 time. In fact, it would be unusual for a lawyer to call a witness without such consultation.\n11 Again, the weight you give to the fact or the nature of the witness's preparation for his or her\n12 testimony and what inferences you draw from such preparation are matters completely within\n13 your discretion.\n73\nDOJ-OGR-00008530",
