For these reasons, I deny the defendant's request to seal the proposed voir dire and questionnaire. They should be docketed by the end of the week, and my chambers will do the same with my draft as well. All right. With that resolved, I would like to turn to the specifics of my draft and hear, with the background now of how we'll proceed and opportunity to have reviewed those drafts in advance, if there are issues to raise, specific objections to my draft questionnaire and voir dire, which I transmitted to the parties yesterday. Ms. Pomerantz. MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor. The government has no objection to the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire. THE COURT: OK. Ms. Sternheim. MS. STERNHEIM: Yes, Judge. Although we would have preferred a more fulsome questionnaire, containing a larger percentage of the questions that we requested, we do have a few requests that we would ask the Court to consider. THE COURT: OK. MS. STERNHEIM: And if you'd just give me a moment so that I can get that document? SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00006999",
