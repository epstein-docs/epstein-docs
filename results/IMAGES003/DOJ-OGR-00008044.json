Neither of these issues is relevant at trial, and both experts should be precluded.\nThe defendant has failed to provide adequate notice as to the four remaining experts. Instead of describing those experts' opinions and the bases for them, as required by Rule 16, the notice identifies topics on which the experts might testify.
