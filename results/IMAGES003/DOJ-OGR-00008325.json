And as I said, if there's something that comes up or you realize you neglected to put it in, we could deal with that. But by and large, you're directing them to a tab in a binder, just like you would direct your paralegal to show a particular document on the screen. What am I missing? MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, we can try that, your Honor. And we'll see how it goes. I mean, we'll be prepared to do it both ways. THE COURT: And I assure you, if for some reason there's something you want to show that's not in the binder, we will work that out and you won't be precluded from showing it. But to the extent you've prepared your cross outline and you know what you're going to ask about, just like you would call it up, just have that in a tabbed binder so they can turn to it. And, again, to be completely clear, should there be anything you need to do that wasn't in the binder, you'll be able to do it and we'll either hand up paper in those few instances or we'll turn off the table monitors and show it on the screen. MR. PAGLIUCA: OK, your Honor. Thank you. THE COURT: Thank you. What else? No? OK. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00008325",
