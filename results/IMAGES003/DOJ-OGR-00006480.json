As described previously, supra at Preliminary Statement, these are inappropriate motions in limine. It is unclear if the government's real intent in filing the motion is to entice defense counsel to share her intended evidence or arguments for trial in advance of the deadlines set by this Court. In any event, Ms. Maxwell's defense and her evidence depends very much on what evidence the government elicits or argues at trial and in opening statements.\n\nThere are certain longstanding and easily understood rules of evidence which apply to this case. Rule 404(a)(2) permits introduction at trial of a defendant's \"pertinent trait,\" which, if offered, the government may rebut. Rule 405(a) permits evidence of a person's character or character trait by reputation or opinion, which, if offered, the opposing party may then inquire as to relevant specific instances of conduct. Rule 608(a) permits a witness's credibility to be attacked or supported by reputation testimony for truthfulness or untruthfulness. Ms. Maxwell and her counsel do not dispute that these rules of evidence apply nor that they all understand the prohibitions on encouraging jury nullification.
