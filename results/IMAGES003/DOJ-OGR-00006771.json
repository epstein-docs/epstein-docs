Although the defense complains that the Government seized \"multiple electronic devices\" containing \"hundreds of thousands of statements spanning decades\" (Def.

The defense need look no further than the Government's exhibit list to discover what documents will be offered at trial.\n\nSimilarly, although the defense complains of \"document dumps\" (id. at 2) and the need to review \"thousands of pages of newly provided discovery material\" (id. at 7), any witness testimony containing co-conspirator statements is contained in the Government's Jencks Act production—and specifically, the Government's production of material for testifying witnesses. Although the Government produced as a courtesy prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, by definition the Government does not plan to call those individuals at trial. And the Government has informed the defense of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom it may refer at trial, so the defense knows exactly which declarants' statements are possibly subject to the co-conspirator exception.

The majority of the statements made by co-conspirators that will be offered at trial have other bases for admissibility. For example, witnesses will testify regarding promises, offers, instructions, and directions they received from Epstein. Those statements are not factual assertions subject to hearsay rules.
