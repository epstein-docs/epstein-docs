And so the fact that the defendant was taking these steps towards a girl who was 17 years old certainly speaks to her knowledge and willingness to provide such a girl to Epstein with respect to the sex trafficking counts as well.\n\nTHE COURT: So to prove the sex trafficking count, we're talking Count Five and Count Six, right?\n\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: On this one, for sex trafficking, you have to prove what with respect to H in order to get a conviction?\n\nMS. MOE: That the victims were less than 18 years old.\n\nI would note on that score, your Honor, with respect to the trafficking counts, the issue is about commercial sex acts in exchange for something of value involving individuals under 18. Minor Victim-3 would testify about participating in sexualized massages with Epstein at the defendant's urging and receiving compensation in part. And that's one of the many other reasons why her testimony is corroborative of other victim testimony in this case and direct evidence of the charged crimes.\n\nTHE COURT: So the conduct took place -- the sexual conduct took place at the age of 17. Factually, this is an individual who says -- the government can't establish under the age of 18 for purposes of travel. I guess that goes to the Mann Act, not to the trafficking count.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00007129",
