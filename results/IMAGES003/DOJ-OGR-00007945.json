And so he really thought this other guy was really cool, and that was how he, you know, came to kind of be introduced and involved in the relationship. There's a -- there was a -- in a clinical setting, I've certainly talked with individuals where, you know, I've talked about that part of, why they came to trust someone and initially started the relationship with them was because either they looked cool or they knew someone that they knew or they were introduced by a friend or a teacher. So in those settings certainly I've -- it's something that happens. THE COURT: Does it surprise you, then, there's no discussion in the literature of that specific phenomenon? THE WITNESS: I think that it's -- no, because I think what I'm talking about is specific ways in which individuals are kind of disarmed or come to trust others, so within the literature the phenomenon of what kinds of things, like -- can create an aura of trust and respectability, that is certainly discussed in the literature. But I think that the example you're asking me about is so highly specific, I think it would fall under the category of a number of things that are discussed, but I'm not aware of it having been discussed that specifically.
