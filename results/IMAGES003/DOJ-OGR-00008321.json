  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 536 Filed 12/10/21 Page 11 of 43 11 LBNAMAXTps this trial in paper format is that there's just too much paper involved. And the plan would be, if we're going to be impeaching the witness, you know, on an inconsistent statement or something else, that we would simply display that electronically to the Court, counsel, and here at the podium, and the witness, do the impeachment, and then take it down. These would not be things that would be shown to the jurors. But I want to make sure that that's an acceptable process to the Court. THE COURT: There are times when the witness will want to see the full document, so you'll have those available should they ask for them or need them. But it's certainly consistent with standard practice to show the document electronically, and, again, say, you want to see more, either the whole document in paper or the page before or after, you'll accommodate that. But otherwise, I don't see an issue. MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. As the Court may have recalled, when the parties submitted a joint proposal with respect to issues regarding witness anonymity, one of the joint proposals was that exhibits under seal which contain identifying information or victims or other relative witnesses would be handled in paper copies with binders for the jurors? THE COURT: Because the screens are visible. MS. MOE: Exactly, your Honor. And so to the extent any of those exhibits fall within that category, our view is SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00008321",
