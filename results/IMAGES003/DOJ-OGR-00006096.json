A person may have several different purposes or motives for such conduct, and each may prompt in varying degrees the person's actions. The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, however, that a significant and motivating purpose of Jane Doe-1's travel across state lines was that she would engage in illegal sexual activity with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn other words, the illegal sexual activity must not have been merely incidental to the trip.\n\nAdapted from Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instrs. and 64-4, 64-18; Edward J.
