From your perspective, other outstanding issues that the Court hasn't addressed yet? MS. COMEY: Nothing outstanding, your Honor. The government did have a few small issues to alert your Honor to. But I'll defer to the defense on these issues you already raised. MR. PAGLIUCA: Late breaking, we requested subpoena issue last evening. THE COURT: Yes. MR. PAGLIUCA: I understand that's very new, but I'm just flagging that as an outstanding issue. THE COURT: Yes. And let me ask, has notice been provided to the victim witnesses? MS. COMEY: No, your Honor. We received it late last night and had not had the opportunity to provide that notice, but we will do that today. THE COURT: So the government will provide notice? MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. THE COURT: So, I don't know that it matters. I can issue the subpoena, if there is a motion to quash, we can deal with it, or we can brief it in advance. I think we need to move as expeditiously as possible, so my inclination would be to issue the subpoena, and if there is a basis to quash, the government can be heard.
