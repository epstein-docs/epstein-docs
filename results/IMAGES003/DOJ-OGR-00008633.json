Ms. Maxwell\n3 has pleaded not guilty to the charges in the Indictment. As a result, the burden is on the\n4 Government to prove Ms. Maxwell's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to each charge. This\n5 burden never shifts to the Defendant for the simple reason that the law never imposes upon a\n6 defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of testifying, or calling any witness, or locating\n7 or producing any evidence. In other words, Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove her innocence.\n8 This presumption of innocence was with Ms. Maxwell when the trial began and remains\n9 with Ms. Maxwell unless and until you are convinced that the Government has proven her guilt\n10 beyond a reasonable doubt as to each charge. Even though Ms. Maxwell has presented evidence\n11 in her defense, the presumption of innocence remains with her and it is not her burden to prove\n12 that she is innocent. It is always the Government's burden to prove each of the elements of the\n13 crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n12\nDOJ-OGR-00008633",
