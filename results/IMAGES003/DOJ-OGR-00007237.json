POMERANTZ: Your Honor, we move to admit 4 Government Exhibit 5. 5 MR. PAGLIUCA: No objection. 6 THE COURT: Government Exhibit 5 is received. 7 (Government's Exhibit 5 received in evidence) 8 BY MS. POMERANTZ: 9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, did you provide the government with this article? 10 A. I did. 11 Q. Why did you provide the government with this article? 12 A. I was asked to provide examples to the government of 13 literature in the field that I thought might be helpful to the 14 court to understand the concepts that I'm talking about. This 15 does a really nice job of pointing to the part that the terms 16 grooming and seduction refer to a pattern of behavior that's 17 widely known and well established to be part of the dynamics of 18 sexual abuse. But in particular, I appreciated the author's 19 emphasis later on in the article of some of the problems with 20 the words seduction and some of the ways that much earlier 21 literature erroneously used terminology that could 22 inappropriately indicate a victim is blamed for the abuse that 23 they have been subjected to. 24 25 MS.
