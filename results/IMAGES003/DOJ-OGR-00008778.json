Evidence obtained from these searches was properly\n4    admitted in this case, and may be properly considered by you. Such searches were appropriate\n5    law enforcement actions. Whether you approve or disapprove of how the evidence was obtained\n6    should not enter into your deliberations, because I instruct you that the Government's use of the\n7    evidence is entirely lawful. You must, therefore, regardless of your personal opinions, give this\n8    evidence full consideration along with all the other evidence in the case in determining whether\n9    the Government has proven the Defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As with all\n10    evidence, it is for you to determine what weight, if any, to give such evidence.\n71\nDOJ-OGR-00008778",
