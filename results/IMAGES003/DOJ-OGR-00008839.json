NATHAN, District Judge:\nThe Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a new trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No. 580. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this matter and will ensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's, interest.\nAccordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance.\nThe Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a letter on the public docket on or before February 1, 2022, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three-part test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Government may file on ECF a response to the Defense's justification letter on or before February 4, 2022.\nUSDC SDNY DOCUMENT ELECTRONICALLY FILED DOC #: _____ DATE FILED: 1/26/22\n20-cr-330 (AJN)\nORDER\nDOJ-OGR-00008839",
