In this article, I report the results of searches using Google Scholar to look at the introduction of this use of the term \"grooming\" to the peer-reviewed literature in 1984 and its increasing use through 2016. Since 2008, the usage has been adopted in hundreds of articles in the professional literature each year, suggesting that this usage of the term \"grooming\" will remain common in the decades ahead. I also examine the history of the term \"seduction\" in the context of child sexual abuse, particularly two archaic uses of the term: as a euphemism for any sexual or sexually stimulating encounter between child and adult and in the context of suggestions that it was the child who seduced the adult. To avoid resurrecting any confusion over these issues, it would be a mistake to abandon \"grooming\" in favor of \"seduction.\" I conclude that the best strategy may be that adopted by Lanning of using the terms grooming and seduction in tandem, explaining the parallels between the seduction of one adult by another and the grooming or seduction of a child by an adult.\n1Park Dietz & Associates, Newport Beach, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nPark Dietz, Park Dietz & Associates, Newport Beach, CA 92663, USA.\nEmail: expert@parkdietzassociates.com\nDOJ-OGR-00006299",
