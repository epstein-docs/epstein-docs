Dr. Rocchio, did you provide the government with this article?\n10 A. I did.\n11 Q. Why did you provide the government with this article?\n12 A. I was asked to provide examples to the government of\n13 literature in the field that I thought might be helpful to the\n14 court to understand the concepts that I'm talking about. This\n15 does a really nice job of pointing to the part that the terms\n16 grooming and seduction refer to a pattern of behavior that's\n17 widely known and well established to be part of the dynamics of\n18 sexual abuse. But in particular, I appreciated the author's\n19 emphasis later on in the article of some of the problems with\n20 the words seduction and some of the ways that much earlier\n21 literature erroneously used terminology that could\n22 inappropriately indicate a victim is blamed for the abuse that\n23 they have been subjected to.\n24 MS.
