Aiding and abetting\n4\nliability is its own theory of criminal liability. In effect, it is a theory of liability that permits a\n5\ndefendant to be convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not herself committing the\n6\ncrime, assisted another person or persons in committing the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and\n7\nSix, therefore, the Defendant can be convicted either if she committed the crime herself, or if\n8\nanother person committed the crime and the Defendant aided and abetted that person to commit\n9\nthat crime.\n10\nUnder the federal aiding and abetting statute, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands,\n11\ninduces, or procures” the commission of an offense is punishable as a principal. You should give\n12\nthose words their ordinary meaning. A person aids or abets a crime if she knowingly does some\n13\nact for the purpose of aiding or encouraging the commission of that crime, with the intention of\n14\ncausing the crime charged to be committed. To “counsel” means to give advice or recommend.\n15\nTo “induce” means to lead or move by persuasion or influence as to some action or state of\n16\nmind. To “procure” means to bring about by unscrupulous or indirect means. To “cause” means\n17\nto bring something about, to effect something.\n18\nIn other words, it is not necessary for the Government to show that Ms. Maxwell herself\n19\nphysically committed the crime charged in order for you to find her guilty. This is because a\n20\nperson who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of a crime is\n21\njust as guilty of that offense as if she committed it herself. Accordingly, you may find Ms.\n22\nMaxwell guilty of the offenses charged in Counts Two, Four, and Six if you find beyond a\n23\nreasonable doubt that the Government has proven that another person actually committed the\n37\nDOJ-OGR-00008658",
