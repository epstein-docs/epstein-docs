  "full_text": "Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 12 of 93\n\nReasonable Doubt\n\nThe question that naturally arises is: \"What is a reasonable doubt?\" What does that phrase mean? The words almost define themselves. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based in reason and arising out of the evidence in the case, or the lack of evidence. It is a doubt that a reasonable person has after carefully weighing all of the evidence in the case.\n\nReasonable doubt is a doubt that appeals to your reason, your judgment, your experience, and your common sense. If, after a fair and impartial consideration of all the evidence, you can candidly and honestly say that you do have an abiding belief of Ms. Maxwell's the defendant's guilt as to any crime charged in this case, such a belief as a prudent person would be willing to act upon in important matters in the personal affairs of his or her own life, then you have no reasonable doubt, and under such circumstances it is your duty to convict the defendant Ms. Maxwell of the particular crime in question.\n\nOn the other hand, if after a fair and impartial consideration of all the evidence, you can candidly and honestly say that you are not satisfied with Ms. Maxwell's the defendant's guilt as to any charge, that you do not have an abiding belief of her guilt as to that charge—in other words, if you have such a doubt as would reasonably cause a prudent person to hesitate in acting in matters of importance in his or her own affairs—then you have a reasonable doubt, and in that circumstances it is your duty to acquit the defendant Ms. Maxwell of that charge.\n\nOne final word on this subject: Reasonable doubt is not whim or speculation. It is not an excuse to avoid an unpleasant duty. Nor is it sympathy for the defendant. \"Beyond a reasonable doubt\" does not mean mathematical certainty, or proof beyond all possible doubt. The law in a criminal case is that it is sufficient if the guilt of the defendant is established beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond all possible doubt, and, therefore, if after a fair and impartial consideration of\n\n12\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006078",
