Her conditions of confinement are extraordinary and “redundant” and have impeded her ability to prepare for trial. Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby were permitted to walk into the courthouse each day of their respective trials. Not until their verdicts were rendered, adjudging them guilty, were they detained. They were accorded dignity to defend themselves. Ms. Maxwell has not.\n\nThe Court should release Ms. Maxwell from pretrial detention. It is the right and just thing to do, most especially for a mature woman with no criminal history, no history of violence, who poses no threat to the community, is not a flight risk, and is eager for her day in court.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell looks forward to her trial and to walking out of the courthouse uncuffed and unshackled following her acquittal.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.
