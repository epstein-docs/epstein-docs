It is your job to decide how\n3 believable each witness was in his or her testimony. You are the sole judges of the credibility of\n4 the witnesses. How do you evaluate the credibility or believability of the witnesses? The answer\n5 is that you use your common sense, judgment, and experience. Common sense is your greatest\n6 asset as a juror. You should ask yourselves, did the witness impress you as honest, open, and\n7 candid? Or did the witness appear evasive, as though the witness was trying to hide something?\n8 How responsive was the witness to the questions asked on direct examination and on cross-\n9 examination? Consider the witness's demeanor, manner of testifying, and accuracy of the\n10 witness's recollection. In addition, consider how well the witness recounted what was heard or\n11 observed, as the witness may be honest but mistaken.\n12 If you find that a witness is intentionally telling a falsehood that is always a matter of\n13 importance that you should weigh carefully. If you find that any witness has lied under oath at\n14 this trial, you should view the testimony of such a witness cautiously and weigh it with great\n15 care. You may reject the entirety of the witness testimony, part of it or none of it. It is for you to\n16 decide how much of any witness's testimony, if any, you wish to credit. A witness may be\n17 inaccurate, contradictory, or even untruthful in some respects and yet entirely believable and\n18 truthful in other respects. It is for you to determine whether such untruths or inconsistencies are\n19 significant or inconsequential, and whether to accept or reject all or to accept some and reject the\n20 balance of the testimony of any witness.\n21 In evaluating credibility of the witnesses, you should take into account any evidence that\n22 the witness who testified may benefit in some way from the outcome of this case. If you find\n23 that any witness whose testimony you are considering may have an interest in the outcome of\n24 this trial, then you should bear that factor in mind when evaluating the credibility of his or her\n61\nDOJ-OGR-00008768",
