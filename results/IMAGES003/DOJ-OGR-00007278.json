What is it in your file that forms the basis of your opinion?\nA. There's nothing in my file that forms the basis of my opinion. What's in my file are, for example, the motion for today's hearing, a copy of the disclosure for some of the witnesses, a redacted copy of those sorts of things, but nothing from which I'm basing my opinion on today.\nQ. OK. You mentioned a contract. You're billing the government at a rate of $450 an hour. Is that correct?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. And your initial government contract is from $45,000. Is that right?\nA. Up to $45,000.\nQ. And how much have you been paid up to today?\nA. Nothing.\nQ. And so you need to complete your contract before you receive your $45,000; is that right?\nA. No. That's not my understanding. I need to prepare an invoice and provide it to the government. And I haven't had a chance to do that yet.\nQ. OK. And do you know what your final invoice will look like in terms of hours spent up till today?\nA. I don't at this point, no.\nQ. How many hours have you spent up till today?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00007278",
