Is it reported, you know, more often or found to have occurred more often, for example, in a group of individuals who are cognitively or intellectually disabled.\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 MS. POMERANTZ: Ms. Durocher, can we pull up Government Exhibit 3, please. Can we turn to page 3.\n7\n8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, we looked at this table before. Can you please explain, what if anything does the table tell you about particular vulnerabilities.\n9\n10\n11 A. So the particular vulnerabilities in particular are most relevant to the first stage of the grooming model, which is the victim-selection model, in terms of looking at who are the individuals that offenders choose to abuse or who end up abusing. And, again, I think it's important to bear in mind that this whole list was initially established from literature looking at what offenders have told us they look for as well as what kinds of prevalence rates have occurred in certain populations.\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20 And then these, in that top section of victim selection, are the factors, vulnerability factors, that there has been statistically significant agreement by professionals factor into victim selection.\n21\n22\n23\n24 Q. And when you say \"the top section,\" you're referring to the -- what part of the table are you referring to?\n25\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00007936",
