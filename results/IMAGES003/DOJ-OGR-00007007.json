STERNHEIM: I'm not sure who the government is referring to. The counsel of record are appearing at this conference. No one else has been a member of the defense team. MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I'm happy to respond to that. Mark Cohen is on the docket in this case, and David Marcus has also represented the defendant in connection with her various appeals. THE COURT: Right. And I've written about the extent to which Mr. Marcus is obligated to follow the relevant rules that apply to the defense in this case. I'm inclined, Ms. Sternheim, to agree for similar reasons to the inclusion of Mr. Rossmiller and include Mr. Cohen and Mr. Marcus. MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I don't mean to draw the distinction that it is correct that at some point Mark Cohen was counsel who put in a notice of appearance. Mr. Marcus has not put in a notice of appearance. He was only coupled in when the government took issue with something that he had written that we had not endorsed. THE COURT: OK. I'm going to include the names. With respect to these three names -- the two for the SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
