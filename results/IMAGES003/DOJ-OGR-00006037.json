Maxwell, 20cr330\n2 Preliminary Remarks Prior to Voir Dire\n3 To be recorded and played on 11/16-11/19\n4\n5 Introduction\n6 Welcome back to the Southern District. Thank you again for your time and service. As I mentioned in my remarks to you when you filled out the questionnaire, I'm Judge Nathan and I am the judge who will preside over this case. The questionnaire you previously filled out was the first step in the jury selection process. Today will be the second step. Some of you will be excused today and will not have to return for this case, although you may be directed to go through a similar process in another case. Others may be directed to return tomorrow if necessary. And ultimately, some of you will return for the third and final step in the process. That will take place on November 29. In any event, after you complete this step of the process today, you will receive instructions on next steps that are particular to you.\n14 As you know from my prior remarks to you and from the questionnaire, we're here today to select a jury to serve in a criminal case, called the United States against Ghislaine Maxwell. As you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and aided and abetted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n22 Thank you for participating in this process. The process of selecting a jury in a criminal case is a critical part of our justice system. The purpose of this process is to select those jurors who can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case. Some people find that they can be fair and\nDOJ-OGR-00006037",
