Minor Victim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2001 and 2004. She knew the defendant by name and gave a description. In the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that Minor Victim-4's identification of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to permit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (1) never identified the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime because the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the time between the abuse and the identification was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The first three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling given Minor Victim-4's contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening time. The defense is free to attempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments supports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4's identification of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knows who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has for the decades since it happened.
