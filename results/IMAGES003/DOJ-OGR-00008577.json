For instance, it affects interstate commerce to use products that\n11 traveled in interstate commerce.\n12 It is not necessary for the Government to prove that Ms. Maxwell specifically knew or\n13 intended that her conduct would affect interstate commerce; it is only necessary that the natural\n14 consequences of such conduct would affect interstate commerce in some way, even if minor.\n15 If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the recruitment, enticement, harboring,\n16 transportation, providing, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex\n17 acts was economic in nature and involved the crossing of state lines, or was economic in nature\n18 and otherwise affected the flow of money to any degree, however minimal, you may find that the\n19 interstate commerce requirement of the offense of sex trafficking of a minor an individual under\n20 the age of 18 has been satisfied.\n21 I further instruct you that to find that this element has been proven beyond a reasonable\n22 doubt, it is not necessary for you to find that any interstate travel occurred.
