Moreover, to the extent the government is seeking to introduce Accuser-3's evidence to show Epstein's sexual preference for \"young girls\"—which would include women who are young, but still above the age of consent like Accuser-3—that would mislead the jury and invite them to convict Ms. Maxwell based on a moral judgment of sexual activity which, in the case of Accuser-3, was entirely legal.\n\nSecond, Epstein's \"sexual preference\" is impermissible propensity evidence that is inadmissible under Rule 404(b). Epstein's alleged \"sexual preference\" is evidence of his character. By its own admission, the government wants to use Accuser-3's testimony to prove this aspect of Epstein's character and argue that he acted in accordance with this character with the other Accusers. That is classic propensity evidence that cannot be admitted under Rule 404(b).\nSee United States v. Buczkowski, No. 5:08-CR-159-F, 2009 WL 10681888, at *1 (E.D.N.C.

As previously argued, Accuser-3's evidence does not show that Ms. Maxwell knew Epstein engaged in sexualized massages with underaged girls. See November 5 Ltr. at 7-8. At most, it establishes that she allegedly knew that he engaged in sexualized massages with adult women. Similarly, her evidence does not show that Ms. Maxwell had a motive to obtain underaged girls to satisfy Epstein's sexual desires. See id. at 8.
