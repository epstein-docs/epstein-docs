(continued) Study Purpose Design Sample Findings Summary Priebe and Svedin (2008) This study aimed to investigate disclosure patterns and examine predictors of disclosure and nondisclosure. Participants completed 65-item questionnaires that included questions about background, consensual sex, sexual abuse experiences, noncontact abuse (e.g., exhibitionism), and female- and male-perpetrated CSA and whether they disclosed CSA or not. The sample consisted of 4,339 high school students in Sweden (2,324 boys). The mean age of the participants was 18.15 years. This study used a subsample of 1,962 participants who reported CSA and answered disclosure questions. Fewer had reported the abuse to a professional (contact abuse) with more severe CSA, but over 69% of boys (23%) and girls (6%) reported disclosure to someone. More of the sexual abuse boys experienced was key to disclosure; father or other male relative, rather than a female abuser. A qualitative component of the study provided a broader understanding of disclosure processes. Study focused on male survivors of CSA disclosure challenges for male survivors of CSA: (1) To understand three issues: (1) To understand",
