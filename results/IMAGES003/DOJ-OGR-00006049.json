Nathan United States District Judge United States Courthouse 40 Foley Square New York, NY 10007 Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) Dear Judge Nathan: Counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell renew our request that the Court release the names of potential jurors, for attorneys' eyes only, as soon as the written questionnaires are distributed. Based on the Court's statement during the October 21 teleconference, it was counsel's understanding that juror names would be provided to counsel on the Juror Sheet to be inserted in the questionnaire. In responding to the Court's order regarding approval of the video to be played to prospective jurors, the government importuned the Court to deny counsel the opportunity to properly vet jurors at this critical state of the proceeding. Not knowing the names of the potential jurors will prevent the parties from conducting necessary background research on the jurors in advance of voir dire so that they may evaluate potential challenges and strikes. Due to the large number of potential jurors (600), waiting until voir dire to release the names of the jurors will make it virtually impossible for the parties to conduct any meaningful research to uncover issues that may require follow-up questions, lead to additional cause challenges, or enable the parties to exercise their peremptory challenges in an informed manner. Recently, in Sines, et al. v. Kessler, et al., 17-CV-72 (KNM) (W.D. Va.), the civil case brought against the organizers of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the United DOJ-OGR-00006049",
