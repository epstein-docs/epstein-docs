Like the first exemplar, this statement was made during the sex trafficking conspiracy that continued past 2004. The statement was also in furtherance of the conspiracy because it related to efforts to protect co-conspirators from legal jeopardy so that the conspiracy might continue. Cf. United States v. Johnson, 469 F. Supp. 3d 193, 213 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\"[A] 'plot to silence [a] witness[ ]' is admissible as a co-conspirator statement, because the plot \"furthers the goals of the conspiracy in that the [conspiracy's objectives] would be facilitated by the acquittal of all the defendants\"\" (quoting United States v. Arrington, 867 F.2d 122, 130 (2d Cir. 1989)). Accordingly, although the Government does not anticipate offering this statement for its truth under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), it would also be admissible on that basis.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00006961",
