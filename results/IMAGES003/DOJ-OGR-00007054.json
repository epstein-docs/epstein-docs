MOE: No, your Honor, thank you.\n5 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?\n6 MS. STERNHEIM: Not at this time, Judge.\n7\n8 THE COURT: All right. I am in receipt of the\n9 parties' various motions in limine, responses in opposition,\n10 and replies in support. I did require the parties to file the\n11 papers on the public docket with their proposed redactions so\n12 that the public could have immediate access to the documents.\n13 I'll rule on the proposed redactions as quickly as I can,\n14 including some that I will discuss today, but we will use\n15 the same process going forward so as not to delay public access\n16 to the bulk of materials related to pretrial filings. And I\n17 thank counsel for that, as well as the submission to me of the\n18 unredacted versions with the color coding indicating requested\n19 redactions.\n20 The government filed 11 motions in limine and the\n21 defense 13, so there's a lot of ground to cover.
