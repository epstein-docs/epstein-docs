Do I have that right? THE WITNESS: No. I'm sorry. What increases susceptibility to grooming would be prior victimization. I believe I'm being asked here now about consensual sexual activity.

THE WITNESS: Can increase the likelihood of being sexually abused later, not necessarily susceptibility to grooming per se, but we know that it increases the likelihood of subsequent victimization. We also know that one of the effects of victimization in and of itself can be an increase in risky behavior. And for adolescents in particular that risky behavior can often take the form of risky sexual behavior.
