The terms \"persuaded,\"\n6 \"induced,\" \"enticed,\" and \"coerced\" have their ordinary, everyday meanings.\n7\n8 The term \"interstate commerce\" simply means movement from one state to another. The\n9 term \"State\" includes a State of the United States and the District of Columbia.\n10\n11 \"Knowingly\" Defined\n12\n13 Ms. Maxwell must have acted knowingly. An act is done knowingly when it is done\n14 voluntarily and intentionally and not because of accident, mistake, or some other innocent reason.\n15\n16 Now, knowledge is a matter of inference from the proven facts. Science has not yet\n17 devised a manner of looking into a person's mind and knowing what that person is thinking.\n18\n19 Whether Ms. Maxwell acted knowingly may be proven by Ms. Maxwell's conduct and by all of\n20 the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.\n21\n22\nDOJ-OGR-00008478",
