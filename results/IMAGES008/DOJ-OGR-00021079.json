In Annabi, the defendants were charged under a three-count indictment in the Eastern District of New York with conspiring to import, importing, and possessing heroin with intent to distribute. See 771 F.2d at 671. After they pled guilty to the substantive importation charge, the prosecutor represented to the court that \"the only agreement that exists between defendants and the Government is that at the time of the imposition of sentence ..., the Government would move to dismiss the two open remaining counts...\" Id. Accordingly, the conspiracy and possession counts were dismissed. See id. Subsequently, the defendants were indicted in the Southern District of New York with conspiracy to distribute heroin. See id.
