Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, MICHAEL THOMAS and TOVA NOEL, the defendants, received a delivery of breakfast carts into the SHU, after which time they were again the only officers in the SHU. Shortly after 6:30 a.m., NOEL and THOMAS walked up to and entered the tier in which Epstein was housed to serve breakfast. At approximately 6:33 a.m., an alarm was activated in the SHU. Epstein was alone in his cell and not responsive, with a noose around his neck. A supervisor who had just started his shift (\"Supervisor-1\") responded to the alarm almost immediately thereafter, and as NOEL approached the door to the SHU to open the door for Supervisor-1, NOEL told Supervisor-1 that \"Epstein hung himself.\" After arriving in the SHU, Supervisor-1 spoke with THOMAS and NOEL. NOEL told Supervisor-1 \"we did not complete the 3 a.m. nor 5 a.m. rounds.\" THOMAS stated, \"we messed up,\" and \"I messed up, she's not to blame, we didn't do any rounds.\"\n12\nDOJ-OGR-00021919",
