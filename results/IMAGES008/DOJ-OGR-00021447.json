The court distinguished In re Dean as \"dictum\" consisting of a \"three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any analysis of the CVRA's text, history, or structural underpinnings.\" The court noted that its interpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department's 2010 OLC opinion concerning victim standing under the CVRA and the Department's efforts in \"implementing regulations.\" Finally, the court raised separation of powers concerns with Wild's (and the dissenting judge's) interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would interfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\nNevertheless, the court was highly critical of the government's conduct in the underlying case, stating that the government \"[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein's lawyers\" regarding information it provided victims about the NPA and that its \"efforts seem to have graduated from passive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.\" The court concluded that although it \"seems obvious\" that the government \"should have consulted with petitioner (and other victims) before negotiating and executing Epstein's NPA,\" the court could not conclude that the government was obligated to do so.
