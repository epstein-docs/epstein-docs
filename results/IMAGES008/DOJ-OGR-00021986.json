  "full_text": "Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 17 Filed 12/19/19 Page 10 of 15 10 JbpWnoC which Ms. Noel has already complied with. During the proceedings before the magistrate court, I presented arguments in favor of her ability to keep her firearm. I'm asking for this Court to reconsider that decision and provide an individualized assessment of whether that condition is appropriate under the circumstances of this case. Your Honor, this case involves allegations of nonviolent criminal conduct. I do not believe that there's a controversy of whether she's a flight risk or danger to the community. What has been said to me with regards to why the application for the firearm has been made by pretrial services is to make them more comfortable so when they come to the home there's not a firearm in the home. I appreciate the fact that pretrial services needs to be safe, and I don't deny that. However, when it comes to infringing upon her Second Amendment right to possess her firearm that she has legally, that's personal to her, I also would like to make one correction in the record from my previous presentation, because I indicated to the Court at that time that she possessed it legally and that she just has it for the home. Well, it turns out she does have credentials to actually carry her firearm in public as it relates to her job. I suspect that that could change if something happened with her job as a result of these proceedings, but that wouldn't change SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00021986",
