Moreover, based on the representations from MDC legal counsel regarding the delivery of the Defendant's legal mail, Dkt.

MDC legal counsel and the Government are ordered to take the steps outlined in the Dkt. No. 422 between now and the completion of trial. As to the Defendant's transport, the Court concludes that she will be transported to and from the courthouse for pretrial conferences and trial in a way that is humane, proper, and consistent with security protocols. This conclusion is based on representations from MDC legal counsel in the letter submitted under seal because it discusses BOP security protocols, see Dkt. No. 412, as well as the Court's communication with the United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York. The Government, BOP, and USMS shall continue to take all available measures consistent with security protocols to ensure the Defendant has sufficient rest, nutrition, and comfort in order to be https://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2110870152221896-L_1_0-1 63/113 DOJ-OGR-00020685",
