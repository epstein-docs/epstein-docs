I do want to emphasize that today the\n7 sentence is based entirely on those crimes and the harm done to\n8 the victims of those charged and proved crimes. The evidence\n9 at trial established that Ms. Maxwell directly and repeatedly\n10 and over the course of many years participated in a horrific\n11 scheme to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls, some\n12 as young as 14, for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein.\n13 I will pause on those words for a moment, \"by and with\n14 Epstein.\" It is important at the outset to emphasize that\n15 although Epstein was, of course, central to this criminal\n16 scheme, Ms. Maxwell is not being punished in place of Epstein\n17 or as a proxy for Epstein. Like every other participant in a\n18 multi-defendant case, Ms. Maxwell is being punished for the\n19 role that she played in the criminal conduct. As to that role,\n20 the trial evidence established that Ms. Maxwell was\n21 instrumental in the abuse of several underage girls and that\n22 she herself participated in some of the abuse, and it is her\n23 conduct for which she has been convicted in the court under the\n24 laws of this country and it is her conduct for which she must\n25 be held accountable.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
