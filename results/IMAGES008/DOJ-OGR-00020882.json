It didn't get heated. It was just confusing, and when people are confused, tones can get raised. Nobody ever yelled at other people. People would just speak, sounding frustrated.\n'So, we [realized] we had to come up with a new game plan and that game plan was, we're going to talk to each other with compassion.'\nAccording to Scotty once the jurors had found a way to 'understand' each other they worked methodically through each count starting with count 2.\nThis was the only charge on which they did not convict Maxwell and related to the charge of 'enticing' Jane to travel for sexual exploitation.\nAn initial vote saw 7 jurors vote guilty and 5 not guilty. Those 'not guilty' votes turned to 'not sure' on further discussion. Ultimately, he said, it was not a question of Jane's credibility but rather the fact that they simply did not feel the evidence was there to meet the necessary bar of beyond reasonable doubt.\nWorking through each charge jurors wrote out lists of evidence on a white board and attached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated towards consensus.\nOn counts two and four - both relating to Jane - there was a 7/5 split of guilty/not sure. On counts one, three and five - all conspiracy charges - there was a 10/2 guilty/not sure split and on count six, the sex trafficking charge relating to Carolyn, all voted guilty from the start.\nScotty said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the jurors to reach a verdict. In fact, he said, when the judge sent a note on Wednesday 29 December informing them that if they had not reached a verdict she would recall them the following day, they were about to send her a note saying they had reached consensus on all counts.\nMaxwell signed an earlier £370,000 ($500,000) legal settlement with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the duke's friend.\nMiss Roberts, 38, one of the billionaire sex offender's most high-profile victims, claims she was trafficked by him and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with Andrew on three occasions when she was 17.\nThe 61-year-old prince vehemently denies the claims and says he has no recollection of even meeting her.\nJudge Kaplan appeared mostly dismissive of the arguments by the duke's lawyer, Andrew Brettler.\nHe said that part of the 2009 settlement protecting 'other potential defendants' that Andrew's lawyers had appeared to be leaning on was 'unclear' and pointed to two sentences in the text that seemed to suggest it could not be used by Andrew.\nJudge Kaplan also pointed to language in the agreement stating it is 'not intended to be used by any other person' to protect themselves from lawsuits without the agreement of Miss Roberts and Epstein - again suggesting Andrew could not rely on it.\nWhile he did not immediately rule at the end of the hearing, he made clear that he was not leaning Andrew's way as he rejected much of the reasoning offered by Mr Brettler, who said the case 'should absolutely be dismissed'.\nJudge Kaplan told the two sides: 'I appreciate the arguments and the passion. You'll have the decision pretty soon.' But he directed that the exchange of potential evidence in the case was to proceed as scheduled - which was seen as an indication he would likely rule against Andrew's motion.\nSources close to the proceedings yesterday described them as 'brutal' for Andrew. During the hour-long hearing, held via video conference due to Covid, Judge Kaplan interjected several times in Mr Brettler's arguments.\nHe told him once: 'With all due respect, Mr Brettler, that's not a dog that's going to hunt here' and another time asked the lawyer outright: 'So what?'\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10370193/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html\n9/16\nDOJ-OGR-00020882",
