The Court rejects the Defendant's additional post-hearing argument that Juror 50 was biased because he failed to follow instructions.\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 50's testimony that he was \"absolutely not\" concerned with following the Court's instructions when filling out the questionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 50 was unable to serve as an unbiased juror.
