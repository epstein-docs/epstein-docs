I felt rushed only because of all the commotion going on in front of me and everybody else just going by on both sides.\nQ. And how did that make you feel rushed?\nA. It made me - growing up in school I never wanted to be the last one finished. You want to finish your test and go hang out with your friends. So it's that same policy, I get that same kind of feeling and I'm like: Why am I still reading this? I'm never going to get it done with. Let's get this done with, let's get this done with.\nQ. Would you say you approached the cilling out of the questionnaire with diligence?\nA. Looking back on it now, your Honor.\nQ. Were you concerned with following my instructions?\nA. Absolutely not.\nQ. You were not concerned with following my instructions?\nA. No, I really -- this is a terrible excuse, but I didn't really think I would be chosen.\nQ. Some of the questions required following on whether a yes or no answer was provided. Do you recall that?\nA. Yes, your Honor.\nQ. And we'll take a quick look at two examples, question 9 on page 8, question 9A and question 10A.\nQuestion 9A asked whether your beliefs would make you\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\n17\nM3BMAX1\nQ. In any way did you intentionally provide an inaccurate answer to this question, your Honor.\nA. Absolutely not.\nQ. In responding to the question, did you answer no so as to make it more likely that you would be selected for the jury?\nA. No, your Honor.\nQ. Did your history of sexual abuse motivate you, again, to try to tailor this answer to be selected for the jury?\nA. No, your Honor, I wasn't even thinking about that.\nQ. I am going to return to the topic of the process for filling out the questionnaire, and you have spoken to that some by background, you will give you as much space as you want to respond.\nA. Just\nby background, you were summoned to appear for jury duty on the morning of November 4th, is that correct?\nA. Yes, your Honor.\nQ. And when did you learn you would be filling out a questionnaire?\nA. When we got to the courtroom.\nQ. When did you learn the case for which you were being considered as a juror?\nA. Three hours after sitting in that chair.\nQ. And how long did it take you to fill out the questionnaire?\nA. It's a great question. I don't recall how long it took, but I want to say we were done by around noon or a little after\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00020898",
