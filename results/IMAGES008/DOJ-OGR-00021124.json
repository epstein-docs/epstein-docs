But neither decision cited Landgraf; purported to follow its two-step framework; or examined §3283's legislative history. Instead, both decisions simply assumed that a criminal statute of limitations can be applied retroactively absent an Ex Post Facto problem under Stogner.

Count Six is also barred by the Statute of Limitations\n\nCount Six (2001-2004) charging §1591 is also time-barred because the 2003 amendment to §3283 cannot be applied retroactively under Landgraf for the reasons stated above. In addition, §3299 cannot be applied retroactively. In 2006, Congress enacted §3299 to eliminate the limitations period for §1591. But since the sex trafficking in Count Six predates the enactment of §3299, Count Six is time-barred unless the statute applies retroactively. Landgraf's \"presumption against statutory retroactivity\" forecloses retroactive operation of this statute at step two as the Government has conceded elsewhere. 511 U.S. at 293. see U.S. v.
