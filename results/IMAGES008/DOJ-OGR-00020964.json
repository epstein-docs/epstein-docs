Yet Juror 50 did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his answer to it on November 4.\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 50 changing his story so much as an explanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The Court is cognizant that jurors may well assign their own emotional connotations to terms like \"family\" rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an attorney or judge.\nCf.
