From his vantage point, he said, he had a vista of the entire court and the 'perfect view' of Maxwell herself.\nHe recalled, 'I could literally see her [at all the time]. There were times when it felt like she was staring right at me and we would lock eyes...it didn't feel real.'\n'She was constantly taking notes, and constantly passing post-it notes over to her attorneys especially when they were on cross examination.'\nAt times, he said, 'I felt like she was watching what we were doing because there were times when some jurors, not during when the victims presented their testimony, but when certain other people presented on things that maybe they didn't feel mattered...some people would nod off.'\nScotty said that Maxwell's manner in court was discussed during deliberations. He said, 'We did discuss that we thought she was a little standoffish and not necessarily cold, more like she was paying attention.'\nIn an insight that will surely come as a gut blow to Maxwell herself, who reportedly wanted to testify but was advised against it, Scotty revealed that if she had taken the stand, 'it would have shown maybe that she was a little more human.'\n'Maybe if she gave her version of the story, who knows, maybe if she gave us a story of how she was manipulated...I don't know. But then that would have been an admission I feel like of guilt.'\nJurors were instructed not to draw any inference of guilt or otherwise from Maxwell's decision not to testify and, Scotty said, it was simply set to one side and not discussed during deliberations.\nAsked if, at any stage, he had experienced any sympathy for Maxwell he said, 'Absolutely. Because this is the rest of her life, right? We were deciding what happens based off the evidence provided.'\n'We took that very seriously because we took at as, this could be on our sister, our sister could be on trial here. We have to really comb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she's either guilty or not.'\nDavid told The Independent he found all the accusers to be credible, despite the defense's attacks on their stories and memories.\nHow Maxwell could claim a mistrial after juror reveals he was victim of child sex abuse and shared his experience with the jury\nGhislainne Maxwell could lodge a claim of mistrial after it emerged one of the jurors who convicted her was a victim of child sex abuse.\nScotty David said he had helped the other members of the jury understand things from a victim's point of view.\nHe also claimed the five guilty verdicts returned last week, possibly condemning Maxwell to spend the rest of her life behind bars, were for 'all the victims'.\nDavid said that after he revealed his ordeal, another juror came forward with to share that they too had been sexually abused.\nLegal experts said that if David failed to disclose his past experiences before the jury deliberations, Maxwell could have grounds to claim a mistrial and have her convictions quashed.\nMoira Penza, a former federal prosecutor in New York, said: 'I certainly hope the juror disclosed this fully on his questionnaire.'\n'A little strange the defence didn't strike him. It could definitely be an issue.'\n'In the first instance it would likely form the basis for a motion to Judge [Alison] Nathan for a new trial.'\nHowever, the question of whether a potential juror was a victim of sexual abuse or a relative or friend of a victim was asked in the 50-question questionnaire completed by each juror ahead of selection.\nScotty could not remember that question when asked by DailyMail.com but was certain that he had answered all questions honestly.\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10370193/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html\n5/16\nDOJ-OGR-00020878",
