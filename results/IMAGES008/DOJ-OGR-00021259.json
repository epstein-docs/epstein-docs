Acosta Agrees to Meet with Epstein's New Attorneys\n\nVillafaña told OPR that Epstein's team was \"incensed\" that Acosta would not meet with them and that the USAO had set such a short deadline to respond to its offer. Around this time, Epstein added to his team Kenneth Starr and Jay Lefkowitz, two prominent attorneys from the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, whom Acosta knew from his employment a decade earlier as an associate at the firm.

Unbelievable.\" During their OPR interviews, neither Acosta nor Sloman remembered the call from Kirkland & Ellis and could provide no additional information about the contact. A reply email from Acosta to Sloman indicates that the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys were considering elevating to the Department their objections to the USAO's involvement in the Epstein matter. In that email, Acosta stated, \"They are likely to go to DC. We should strategize a bit. We are not changing positions, and that should be made clear.\"\n\nThe next day, Acosta wrote to Sloman:\n\n[Epstein's] attorneys want to go to DC on the case, on the grounds of a process foul, i.e., that I have not met with them.

Why don't we just move forward?\"\n\n94 Acosta told OPR that as a junior associate with Kirkland & Ellis from September 1995 to March 1997, he had worked on at least one matter each with Starr and Lefkowitz, and since that time, he had professional acquaintanceships with both.\n\n95 Menchel told OPR that he did not remember the timing of the call, but he did remember an occasion on which he entered Acosta's office as Acosta was finishing a phone conversation, and Acosta stated, \"[T]hat was Ken Starr,\" and told Menchel the call related to the Epstein case.\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-00021259",
