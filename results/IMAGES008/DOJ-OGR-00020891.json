Consistent with that anonymity order during trial, I will permit that to continue. In that letter dated March 1st, 2022 that Mr. Spodek informed me that Juror 50 would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination at this hearing. Ask you see from my February 24 opinion, Mr. Spodek, I am going to ask Juror 50 questions today about responses that he gave during the jury selection process in the case of United States v. Maxwell. Does it remain your client's intention to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to those questions?\nMR. SPODEK: Yes, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: I'm going to confirm on the record with your client, Mr. Spodek, is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege in response to the questions I'm going to ask you today?\nJUROR 50: Yes, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: All right. I received a written application from the government last night. Ms. Moe, could you confirm that the government is making the application?\nMS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

I am denying that request. I will conduct this proceeding in accord with my February 24 opinion.\nFollowing my questioning, I will hear from counsel for the parties at sidebar as to any proposed follow-up questions that they wish be asked and I will consider those requests. In a moment, I will address counsel for Juror 50.\nLet me ask counsel for the parties if there are any preliminary matters.\nMS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor, thank you.\nMS.

Juror 50 is present and represented by retained counsel, Mr. Spodek.\nMr. Spodek, just as a preliminary matter, does your client wish that he be referred to here as Juror 50 rather than using his full name?\nMR. SPODEK: Yes.\nTHE COURT: And I understand, but again confirm for me that in post-verdict press interviews he did not reveal his last name, is that correct?\nMR.
