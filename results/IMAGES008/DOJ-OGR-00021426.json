[and] now it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.\" Villafaña recalled \"explaining that the case was under investigation,\" that they \"were preparing the case [for charging] again,\" and \"expressing our hope that charges would be brought.\" Villafaña recalled one victim \"making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it so low\" and Villafaña answered, \"that was the agreement that the office had reached.\"\n\nWith regard to the victims Villafaña interviewed who had not received an FBI notification in October 2007, Villafaña recalled discussing one victim's safety concerns but not whether they discussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that \"we thought we had reached an agreement with [Epstein] and then we didn't,\" but was \"pretty sure\" that she did not mention the agreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafaña explained that she likely did not discuss the agreement because at that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn't know anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was going to end up being thrown on the heap, and I didn't want to -- . . . if you tell people, oh, look, he's already admitted that he's guilty, like, I didn't want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get the facts of the case.\n\nThe CEOS Trial Attorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims about the NPA or the status of the case.340 She did remember explaining the significance of the prosecution to one victim who \"did not think anything should happen\" to Epstein. The FBI case agent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2008 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI interview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Attorneys for the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2007 about the resolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2020, their clients had no memory of meeting with authored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the investigation or the resolution of the case.
