As explained, I will use the\n3    2003 Guidelines manual. Following Section 2G1.1(d)(1), each\n4    victim is considered a separate count of conviction. In\n5    addition to the three victims for which an offense level was\n6    calculated in the PSR -- Jane, Annie, and Carolyn -- I\n7    calculate offense levels, for Virginia and Melissa, coming to a\n8    total of 5 groups.\n9        For all groups, the base offense level is 19. That's\n10   Sections 2G1.1(a) and 2X1.1(a).\n11       For Jane and Carolyn, because they were older than 12\n12   but were not yet 16 when abuse began, the offense level is\n13   enhanced by 2. 2G1.1(b)(2)(B).\n14       The offense level for Jane and Carolyn is further\n15   enhanced by 2 because they were unduly influenced into a\n16   commercial sex act. 2G1.1(b)(4)(B).\n17       For Annie, Virginia, and Melissa, who were at least\n18   16, the offense level is increased by 2 because they were\n19   unduly influenced into a commercial act. 2G1.1.(b)(4)(B).\n20       The offense level for all groups are also enhanced by\n21   4 points because of the supervisory role in an extensive\n22   criminal activity. 3B1.1(a).\n23       This brings the total offense level for Jane's and\n24   Carolyn's groups to 27. And Annie's, Virginia's and Melissa's\n25   groups each to 25.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00021593",
