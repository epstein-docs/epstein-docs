Last summer, the watchdog released a 568-page report on Midyear Exam, the DOJ and FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's improper private email server. And the inspector general is expected to release the results of his investigation into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during the Trump-Russia probe sometime around Labor Day.\nEpstein's apparent suicide followed the unsealing on Friday of 2,000 pages of court records by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit connected to the defamation lawsuit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's on-again-off-again girlfriend and longtime associate whom Giuffre has accused of helping Epstein abuse her and other women when Giuffre was underage. The records included allegations by Giuffre that Maxwell instructed her to have sex with the U.K.'s Prince Andrew, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, and former Sen. George Mitchell as well as money manager Glenn Dubin and MIT professor Marvin Minsky, among other high-profile figures.\nBefore Friday, Epstein's flight records spanning from 1999 through 2005 had been made public, but new flight manifests ranging from November 1995 through August 2013 were released Friday. The records show Epstein crisscrossed the globe accompanied by tycoons, celebrities, employees, friends, and politicos.\nAlex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney for Southern Florida, reached an agreement in 2008 with Epstein's attorneys in which Epstein was allowed to plead guilty to two state-level prostitution solicitation charges. Epstein served just 13 months of an 18-month stint at a Palm Beach County jail where he was allowed out on work release, paid restitution to certain victims, and registered as a sex offender. The agreement was reportedly struck before investigators had finished interviewing all the alleged victims and was kept secret from some of Epstein's victims. Acosta left his Cabinet position amid increased scrutiny of the sweetheart deal.\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-announces-doj-inspector-general-investigation-into-epstein-death\n2/3\nDOJ-OGR-00022053",
