I am also required to consider the other factors set\n8 forth in a provision called 18 U.S.C. 3553(a). These include\n9 the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history\n10 and characteristics of the defendant; the need for the sentence\n11 imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\n12 respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the\n13 offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to\n14 protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, to\n15 provide needed educational, vocational training, medical care,\n16 or other treatment. I am to take into account the kinds of\n17 sentences available, as I have said, the guideline range, any\n18 pertinent policy statement, the need to avoid unwarranted\n19 sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who\n20 have been found guilty of similar conduct, the need to provide\n21 restitution as appropriate under the law to any victims of the\n22 offense.\n23 I am required to impose a sentence sufficient, but no\n24 greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes I have just\n25 described.
