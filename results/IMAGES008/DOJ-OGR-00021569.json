MOE: Post indictment conduct, your Honor.\n13 THE COURT: Post indictment. Is it in some way not\n14 post conspiracy?\n15 MS. MOE: Well, your Honor, again, the question before\n16 the Court, according to the application is when the did offense\n17 end.\n18 THE COURT: Ms. Moe, I do understand you're framing\n19 that question. I'm asking record evidence question. Is there\n20 something you're pointing to for your statement, the post 2005\n21 which consists of conspiratorial conduct?\n22 MS.
