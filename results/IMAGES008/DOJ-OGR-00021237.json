He also pointed out that in numerous emails before the June 26, 2007 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he wanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have discussed a potential resolution with Sanchez \"without having discussed it with me.\"\n1. Acosta's Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based Resolution\nSubsequent events showed that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was pivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta explained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta said that although he, Sloman, and Menchel \"believed the victims\" and \"believed [Epstein] did what he did,\" they were concerned \"about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in terms of testimony.\"59 Acosta also recalled discussions with his \"senior team\" about how the victims would \"do on the stand.\"\nAcosta told OPR that \"from the earliest point\" in the investigation, he considered whether, because the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n57 Villafaña explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a substantive charge, \"consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,\" with \"a recommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein] would receive credit for time in state custody towards his federal release date.\" See n.65 for an explanation of the Ashcroft Memo.\n58 Villafaña was in trial and on July 4, 2007, likely before reading Menchel's email, Villafaña responded to defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, \"If you would like to discuss the possibility of a federal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.\"\n59 In commenting on OPR's draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or deciding how to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in reaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. However, Sloman also told OPR that he had little recollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and Menchel.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-00021237",
