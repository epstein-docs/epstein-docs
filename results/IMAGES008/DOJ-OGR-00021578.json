But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really didn't know what her role was, and his best recollection was that she was an assistant for Epstein.\n10 And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's testimony who was the actual assistant for Ms. Maxwell, and she says unequivocally, \"I was her assistant. Kellen was Epstein's assistant.\" So there is no fair inference that Ms. Maxwell was supervising Sarah Kellen. The inference is exactly the opposite, and it can't provide a basis for that leadership enhancement.\n17 THE COURT: All right. Anything further on the enhancements for the government's objection?\n19 MS. MOE: Your Honor, just very briefly with respect to the leadership question, I just want to direct the Court's attention, we noted this on page 27 of our brief, but the testimony at trial was that Carolyn recalled that even after Sarah Kellen took over calling to schedule massages, Maxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for massage appointments.\n25 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C...
