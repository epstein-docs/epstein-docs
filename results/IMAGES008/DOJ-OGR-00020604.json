We have been working diligently on this case and have identified several issues\nthat we believe merit appellate review. However, there is still considerable work to be done. We\nfind that we need an additional month beyond the current deadline to complete this important\nwork responsibly.\n\n9. We believe that the above represents extraordinary circumstances that justify the\nrelief sought. Denial of this application would cause irreparable harm to our client.\n\n10. Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Rohrbach informed me today that\nRespondent United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York does not\nobject to the Court granting our motion for an additional one-month extension of time to file\nAppellant's brief.\n\n11. We respectfully request that the Court extend our time to file our brief to February\n28, 2023. We are cognizant that the Court warned that \"[f]urther extensions of time will be\ndisfavored.\" For this reason, we request only the additional time that we believe is absolutely\nnecessary in order to effectively represent our client.\n\nWHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested that this Court issue an Order granting\nAppellant's motion in its entirety, and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just\nand proper.\n\nDated: January 12, 2023\nNew York, New York\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\nAIDALA, BERTUNA & KAMINS, PC\nBy:\nJOHN M.
