Brown, Esq. Linda Childs, Esq.\nAs previously noted, I intend on filing a motion for dismissal based on selective prosecution. If successful, this motion will entitle my client to additional discovery beyond what has previously been provided which also pushes the trial timeline beyond April of 2020.\nMy client's position is also that we are entitled to any and all reports, memorandums, witness statements and investigative reports written, produced or possessed by the inspector general regarding this incident and the Federal Bureau of Prison's policy regarding written statements and employee conduct.\nIt should be noted, that it took the justice department, the FBI, the inspector general's office and an assortment of other federal agencies more than 90 days to investigate this matter. Accordingly, it is more than reasonable that it would take the defendant and his counsel, who have less than one percent of the man power and resources of the government, a significantly longer time to accomplish an adequate investigation and review of all the necessary information provided in this case.\nRespectfully yours, /s/ Montell Figgins Montell Figgins, Esq.
