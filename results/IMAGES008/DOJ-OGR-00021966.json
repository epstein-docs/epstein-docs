THE COURT: Just so I understand your argument, you would like your client to retain her personal-use firearm because she otherwise has the right to do so? She doesn't need it for any particular reason? MR. FOY: Well, I suppose a person who has a firearm may feel that they need it for their self-protection. Now, I'm not suggesting that there's been some specific threat or anything, other than the world is crazy, but if she hasn't done anything improper with regards to that important right, it shouldn't be sacrificed now, at an arraignment, as a condition of her release, when she has fully cooperated with everything up until this point. We've been in communication with the government since August 14th, and communicated about her international travel since this investigation began. All we've done is comply and put the government on notice as to her whereabouts and what's going on. We've been completely cooperative in that respect. But when you talk about removing someone's personal firearm, that they legally possess in their home - she doesn't have a license to carry it anywhere, just in her home - unless there is a reason connected to the case, to the crime, that suggests that it could be in fact a danger to a third party or someone else, then, in that case, I would understand, but not SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
