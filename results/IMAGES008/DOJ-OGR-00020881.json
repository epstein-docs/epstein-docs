He said, 'We did discuss that we thought she was a little standoffish and not necessarily cold, more like she was paying attention'\nHowever, the question of whether a potential juror was a victim of sexual abuse or a relative or friend of a victim was asked in the 50-question questionnaire completed by each juror ahead of selection.\nScotty could not remember that question when asked by DailyMail.com but was certain that he had answered all questions honestly.\nHe also revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual abuse and that it did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty.\nIt did, however that he believes give him access to a better understanding of the testimony of victims.\nTo that end, he said, the defense's tactic of 'going hard' on the victims did not play well with him or other jurors.\nScotty pointed to defense attorney Laura Menninger's use of air-quotes when questioning Jane about her story of 'escaping' Epstein at one point.\nHe said, 'Everything, her tone, using air-quotes with escape ... I think she was acting in order to convince us that this girl's lying and lying for money.'\nInstead, he said, all it did was convince jurors that the defense team were showing a complete lack of respect for the victims.\nHe said, 'I just felt terrible I'm like, 'I can't believe you're treating this woman like this.' Like even if she's lying there's better ways to go about it...I don't feel attacking them that way or degrading her based on what she said was the way to go.'\nThe jury was sent out with a daunting 80 pages of instructions after a trial that was often dizzying in detail with lengthy testimony from the victims alone, and six counts to consider.\nAt first, Scotty admitted, jurors struggled to know where to start or how to make any progress at all.\nHe said that they did not take an initial vote of opinions but instead, on the first day they were sent out simply chose a foreperson and began by reading the instructions page by page.\nHe said, 'It was overwhelming. I mean 80 pages of how you interpret the law on each count, and it flips back and forth between different pages, and you have to flip 20 pages in order to get a definition of something else that can apply to one specific count.'\n'Brutal' Prince Andrew court hearing 'couldn't have gone worse' for him: Duke's hopes of having case thrown out hang by a thread after judge 'made it very clear he did not accept' royal lawyers' arguments, experts say\nPrince Andrew's hopes of getting the case by his US sex accuser thrown out of court were hanging by a thread last night following a 'brutal' hearing in New York.\nA judge told the royal he would find out 'pretty soon' - most likely within days - if his bid to have the lawsuit dismissed would be successful.\nBut the early signs were not good for the Queen's son after Judge Lewis Kaplan put his legal team through a bruising encounter during a make-or-break hearing in New York yesterday.\nOne legal expert said that the hearing 'could not have gone worse' and pointed out that the fact that his lawyers were reduced to saying they 'respectfully disagree' with the judge did not bode well- adding 'respectfully disagreeing with the judge means you are about to lose.'\nPrince Andrew is interviewed for the BBC's Newsnight in November 2019.
