That would not be a significant\n5 or motivating purpose.

But\n10 returning from there is not that purpose. Returning is\n11 returning, or it's going somewhere else; it's going somewhere\n12 away from where -- at least in the record, the evidence in the\n13 record, if there is any -- Epstein was presumably in New\n14 Mexico. This is her leaving New Mexico. So I don't think that\n15 qualifies as a significant or motivating purpose. That travel\n16 across state lines is for some other purpose.\n17 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I don't believe this note is\n18 that clear about what flight we're talking about. The note\n19 begins by talking about an unspecified return flight, and then\n20 it turns to talking about a flight to New Mexico. Then there's\n21 a modifying clause about intent. It is unclear which of the\n22 two flights we are now modifying.\n23 I think the safest course here is to refer the jury to\n24 the elements of the crime.
