Nathan from Christian R. Everdell dated 2/1/22 re: Extension of Time. ENDORSEMENT: The extension request is hereby GRANTED. The briefing schedule for other post-verdict motions is revised as follows: - Defense submission: February 11, 2022. Government response: February 25, 2022. Defense reply: March 11, 2022. (Motions due by 2/11/2022. Responses due by 2/25/2022. Replies due by 3/11/2022) (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 2/2/2022) (ap) (Entered: 02/02/2022)\n| 02/04/2022 | 593 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: As a post-trial house-keeping matter, attached to this Order are the Court Exhibits. The parties have proposed redactions to several exhibits and the sealing of Court Exhibit 4. The Court concludes that the proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006), and narrowly tailored. The redactions serve the purpose of protecting the anonymity of jurors and of victim-witnesses subject to the Court's anonymity order. With respect to Court Exhibit 4, rather than seal the entire document, the Court has redacted the information that would potentially identify the victim-witness who testified pursuant to the Court's anonymity order. Unredacted copies of the Court Exhibits will be filed under seal. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 2/4/2022)(ap) (Entered: 02/04/2022)\n| 02/04/2022 | 594 | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated February 4, 2022 re: Opposition to Defendant's Sealing Request Document filed by USA. (Pomerantz, Lara) (Entered: 02/04/2022)\n| 02/08/2022 | 595 | LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Bobbi C. Sternheim dated 2/8/2022 re: Request for Sealing (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 02/08/2022)\n| 02/11/2022 | 596 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' letters addressing the Defendant's request to temporarily seal her motion for a new trial and accompanying exhibits, and the Government's response in opposition and accompanying exhibits. See Dkt. Nos. 590, 594, 595. Several media organizations have also filed letters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 50's motion to intervene. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The Defendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 50's motion. For the reasons outlined more fully below, the Court rules as follows. First, the Defendant's motion to temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a new trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrowly tailored to serve competing interests. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 2/11/2022)(jw) (Entered: 02/11/2022)\n| 02/11/2022 | 597 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court's chambers received the attached letter via email from counsel for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) seeking leave to file an amicus brief regarding the Defendant's motion for a new trial. The Court issues this Order in response. If any party wishes to file an amicus brief concerning the Defendant's motion for a new trial, it may submit to the Court via email a motion for leave to do so on or before February 18, 2022. The Court will only consider such a\nhttps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?211087015221896-L_1_0-1 90/113\nDOJ-OGR-00020712",
