As the Fourth Circuit noted, prosecuting a defendant for the same charges resolved by plea agreement in a different district puts at stake “the honor of the government[,] public confidence in the fair administration of justice, and the efficient administration of justice in a federal scheme of government.” Carter, 454 F.2d at 427-28. Here, under the “sufficiently-distinct” qualification to Annabi, the Government was precluded, at minimum, from charging Appellant under Count Six. This count arose out of the 2006-08 SDFL investigation and is based on a trafficking statute, § 1591(a), that is explicitly mentioned in the NPA. A175. The only accuser on whom Count Six is based, Carolyn, was also a witness in the SDFL investigation. [T: 1604-5, 1614, 1679]. But unlike the SDNY charges in Annabi, Count Six falls wholly within the time period contemplated by the NPA as well. Compare 771 F.2d at 672. Count Six alleged that Defendant trafficked Carolyn from 2001 to 2004. The court held that the NPA “cover[s] any involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed by Epstein from 2001 to 2007,",
