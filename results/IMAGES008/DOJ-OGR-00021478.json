As Epstein's counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and civil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against Epstein by the government's promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 20, 2008 state deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.435 In her 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaña identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the government's decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for 18 U.S.C. § 2255 recovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2008, the Friday before Epstein's Monday, June 30, 2008 state court guilty plea hearing, Villafaña contacted Edwards to inform him that upon coming hearing.
