Alternatively, the District Court's reliance on U.S. v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 1985) to resolve perceived ambiguities was an error and the District Court should have ordered a hearing.\n\nMs. Maxwell further argues that the District Court's findings and conclusions concerning Juror 50 were an abuse of discretion in three respects: (1) Juror 50's explanations for his false answers to a juror questionnaire were incredible on their face; (2) Juror 50's concealed traumatic experience as a victim of childhood sexual abuse under circumstances analogous to the experiences of the Government witnesses, if known during voir dire, would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause; and (3) the Court abandoned its obligation to ascertain not merely the juror's credibility, but also the validity of a challenge for cause, when it unduly narrowed the scope of its examination of Juror 50 at the post-trial hearing.\n\n1\n\nDOJ-OGR-00021749",
