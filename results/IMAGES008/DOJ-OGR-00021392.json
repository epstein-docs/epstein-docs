The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C. § 10606), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide victim services, which attach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-enforceable rights that attach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\nIn 2015, Congress amended the CVRA and added the following two rights:266\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement.\n(10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the services described in section 503(c) of the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 10607(c)) and provided contact information for the Office of the Victims' Rights Ombudsman of the Department of Justice.\nIII.
