Villafaña said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset of the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein's legal team would likely employ. Villafaña explained, \"When you have a case that you know people are going to be getting calls about . . . you just want to make sure that they know about it so they don't get . . . a call from out of the blue.\" According to Villafaña, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to put the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she \"didn't want to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur\" with a federal prosecution as had occurred with the state. She told OPR, \"I remember specifically saying to them that I expected the case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI's resources if the Office would just back down to pressure at the end.\" According to Villafaña, Acosta and Sloman promised that \"if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.\" In a later email to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafaña recounted that she spoke with Acosta and Sloman because she \"knew that what is happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal prosecution if the U.S. Attorney isn't on board,\" but Acosta and Sloman had given her \"the green light\" to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2006 meeting with Villafaña. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not previously heard of Epstein.22\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man who was \"doing sordid things\" with girls, and that it \"seemed a reasonable matter to pursue\" federally. Epstein's wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told OPR, the USAO had prosecuted \"lots of influential folks.\" When asked by OPR to articulate the federal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, \"the exploitation of girls or minor females.\" Regarding Villafaña's view that she had been given a \"green light\" to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have explicitly told Villafaña to \"go spend your time\" on the case; rather, his practice would have been simply to acknowledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal investigation \"sound[ed] reasonable.\"\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein investigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Attorney's Office had \"abdicated their responsibility\" to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall with specificity Villafaña's concern about Epstein's team pressuring the State Attorney's Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect the USAO, noting that as of July 2006, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically connected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of Epstein. On July 24, 2006, Villafaña emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as a \"Manhattan money manager\" and \"part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey.\" Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\n\n19\nDOJ-OGR-00021219",
