For over a decade, Maxwell traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his private planes and mingled with rich and famous people, while enjoying a life of extraordinary luxury. (Tr.96-99, 233-34, 303-04, 1194). Maxwell and Epstein spent time together in Epstein's various properties, including his mansion on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his apartment in Paris, and his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (Tr.99). Maxwell also received a townhouse that Epstein bought for her in New York City, and Epstein transferred more than $23 million to Maxwell during the timeframe of the conspiracy. (Tr.1194, 1310-17).\nIn addition to her role as Epstein's girlfriend, Maxwell also supervised Epstein's households as \"the lady of the house.\" (Tr.95, 783-84). When she took charge of Epstein's homes, she imposed strict rules for staff, some of which were included in a household manual dictating the operation of the Palm Beach residence. (Tr.807-08, 823-31).\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure, Maxwell fostered a culture of silence at Epstein's homes. (Tr.784, 826). The household manual made clear that staff were to \"see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at\" that staff member. (Tr.826). Maxwell directed Juan Alessi, the former manager of Epstein's Palm Beach villa, to speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look Epstein in the eyes. (Tr.784).\nDOJ-OGR-00021664",
