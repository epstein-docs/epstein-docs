What kind of person persuades young girls to\n8 massage the feet of a middle-aged man? What kind of person\n9 gets a 16-year-old girl all alone at a ranch in the middle of\n10 nowhere and tells her to take off her clothes and get on a\n11 massage table so that she can grope that girl's chest?

What kind of person sees a\n14 17-year-old girl on the street and pulls over so that she can\n15 persuade that girl to come to a house of horrors where that\n16 young girl will be trafficked for sex? What kind of person\n17 flies around on a plane with underage girls so that when her\n18 boyfriend travels, he always has a young girl to touch? What\n19 kind of person would use their privilege, their power in this\n20 world to intentionally prey on the vulnerable, young girls from\n21 struggling families: Girls without fathers, girls who needed\n22 help.
