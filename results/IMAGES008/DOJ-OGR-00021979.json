DONALESKI: Your Honor, we'll provide a draft to defense counsel within the next day, and then depending on how long it takes for them to comment on it and the parties to reach a resolution, we'll provide it to the Court as expeditiously as possible, so it's my hope that that can happen within a week.\n8 THE COURT: All right. By the end of December, discovery should have been produced. Is that correct?\n10 MS. DONALESKI: That's fine, your Honor.\n11 THE COURT: It's not voluminous, is it?\n12 MS. DONALESKI: Your Honor, it will consist of hundreds of hours of video recording, so in that aspect it will be voluminous, but the paper records, the bank records will not be voluminous.\n17 THE COURT: All right. It doesn't seem that you would need more than a month to review the discovery so that by the end of January, you should have made decisions as to whether you're going to be filing motions. Correct?\n20 MR. FIGGINS: Your Honor, if I may?\n21 I also know that there's an ongoing inspector general's report. I don't have any idea as to the time frame, if and when that's going to be completed. I do believe that there would be some pertinent information, relevant information\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300",
