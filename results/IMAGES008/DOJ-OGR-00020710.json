The Court is in receipt of the parties' joint letter regarding a schedule for sentencing and resolution of the severed perjury counts. Dkt. No. 574. The Court hereby schedules the sentencing in this matter for June 28, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. The Court will delay ordering the preparation of a presentence investigation report until April 2022. The Court previously set the schedule for briefing on the new trial motion as well as all other post-verdict motions. Dkt. No. 571. That schedule remains in place. The Court adopts the parties' proposal that the scheduling of any proceedings related to the severed perjury counts be deferred until the post-verdict motions are resolved. By January 18, 2022, the Government shall indicate in a joint letter whether it is seeking an exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act for the perjury counts and the basis for any requested exclusion. In the joint letter, the defense shall indicate whether it consents to the proposed exclusion of time (Sentencing set for 6/28/2022 at 11:00 AM before Judge Alison J. Nathan.)
