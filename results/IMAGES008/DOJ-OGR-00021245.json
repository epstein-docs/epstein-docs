Lastly, I was not trying to \"dictate\" a meeting with the U.S. Attorney or anyone else.

With respect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say that disagreements about strategy and raising concerns about the forgotten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified as a lapse in judgment.

She viewed Mechel's message as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even though she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise her concerns.71 Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not \"order\" Villafaña to refrain from raising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafaña foreclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, \"the context of this exchange is, she is running roughshod over the U.S. Attorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You're not in charge of it. I'm not in charge of it. [Acosta's] in charge of it.\" Acosta, who was apparently not aware of Villafaña's email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective, Villafaña was not \"frozen out\" of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him directly for a meeting.\n\nB. Villafaña Attempts to Obtain the Computer Equipment Missing from Epstein's Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\n\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2007 how to resolve the federal investigation, one item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer equipment removed from Epstein's home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although Villafaña took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n\n70 Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n71 Villafaña told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafaña, but that Menchel responded it was not Villafaña's \"place\" to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-00021245",
