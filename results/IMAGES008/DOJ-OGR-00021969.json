And for Ms. Noel, your travel will be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the District of New Jersey and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In addition, I'm imposing the requirement for Mr. Thomas that he refrain from the excessive use of alcohol, and, for Ms. Noel, the requirement that she -- I'm going to give the authority to pretrial to determine whether or not a mental health evaluation or support is needed, but that will be at the direction of your pretrial services officer. Let me warn each of you that if you fail to appear in court or if you violate any of the conditions of your release, a warrant will be issued for your arrest, and you and anybody who cosigned the bond may be responsible for paying its full amount, which is $100,000, and you will be charged with a separate crime of bail-jumping. In addition, if you commit an offense while you're on pretrial supervision, you may be subject to a more severe punishment than you would receive if you committed the very same offense at any other time. Has Judge Torres set the next conference date? MR. ROOS: Yes, your Honor. The judge set it for November 25, 2019. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00021969",
