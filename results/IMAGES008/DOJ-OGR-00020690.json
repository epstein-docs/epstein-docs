(Rohrbach, Andrew) (Entered: 11/12/2021)\n11/12/2021 456 LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated November 12, 2021 re: Co-Conspirator Statements Document filed by USA. (Comey, Maurene) (Entered: 11/12/2021)\n11/12/2021 458 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter motion seeking clarification on two items from the November 1, 2021 pretrial conference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification about the line between permissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses testifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to permissible cross-examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross-examination. See United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2008). The line of questioning the Government identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus the Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on cross-examination. As the Court noted at the November 1 conference, the Defendant may not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment may be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty.
