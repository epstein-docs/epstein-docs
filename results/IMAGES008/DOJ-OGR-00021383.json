As OPR has set forth in substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the prosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more appropriately be tied to Acosta's misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state crime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had set, even when Villafaña and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta himself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in greater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records revealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta was involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie told OPR that it was \"unusual to have a U.S. Attorney get involved with this level of detail.\" Menchel told OPR, \"I know we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I'm sure with Jeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.\" Lourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, . . . he would have been talking to Jeff and Matt, talking to me to the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros Memo and . . . the guidance from CEOS, he would have been reading the defense attorney's letters, maybe talking to the State Attorney, I don't know, just . . . all these different sources of information he was -- I'm comfortable that he knew the case, you know, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you know, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff . . . .\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels in the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knowledge of the facts of the case—Villafaña and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution memorandum on his own, but as he told OPR, he recognized that the case was going to go through the front office \"[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.\" Yet, although Acosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as overseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a consequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ownership of the investigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafaña included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon which Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made traveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafaña. Villafaña did draft a detailed, analytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have relied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel's departure. Despite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such as Oosterbaan's strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafaña's concerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA.
