If, however, the \"statute is ambiguous or contains no express command regarding retroactivity,\" then the court must turn to the second step, where \"a reviewing court must determine whether applying the statute to antecedent conduct would create presumptively impermissible retroactive effects.\" Id. at 55. \"If it would, then the court shall not apply the statute retroactively absent clear congressional intent to the contrary.\" Id. \"If it would not, then the court shall apply the statute to antecedent conduct.\" Id.\nB.
