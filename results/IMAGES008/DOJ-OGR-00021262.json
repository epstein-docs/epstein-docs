The draft NPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 31, 2007, and called for Epstein to enter a state plea by September 28, 2007.

September 7, 2007: Acosta, Other USAO Attorneys, and FBI Supervisors Meet with Epstein Attorneys Starr, Lefkowitz, and Sanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2007, Acosta, Sloman, Villafaña, Villafaña's co-counsel, Oosterbaan, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO's West Palm Beach office with defense attorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkowitz.102 This was Acosta's first meeting with Epstein's defense team. Villafaña understood the purpose of this meeting was to afford Epstein's counsel an opportunity to \"make a pitch\" as to why the case should not be prosecuted federally. Villafaña recalled that at a \"pre-meet\" before defense counsel arrived, Acosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not \"a negotiation,\" but a chance for the defense to present their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafaña similarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case should remain a state matter in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafaña and her co-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held Senate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were \"the only people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.\" Acosta did not recall the comment, but he told OPR, \"[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\n\nChapter Three, the Department's position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in matters in which the government did not pursue a federal charge.

During September 2007, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C., as he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Chief of Staff to the head of the Department's Criminal Division, Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher.
