I overrule this objection for the same reasons as\n7 articulated with respect to paragraph 22. In addition, the\n8 trial evidence established that the defendant and Epstein\n9 isolated girls by spending time with them alone away from their\n10 families. For example, Annie's testimony regarding the trip to\n11 New Mexico. Jane's testimony that she would spend time at the\n12 Palm Beach residence alone with Epstein and the defendant.\n13 Paragraphs 27 and 28 the defendant makes two\n14 objections: First, to the assertion that the defendant and\n15 Epstein developed a scheme that created a \"constant stream of\n16 girls who recruited each other.\" And, second, she objects to\n17 the assertion that she encouraged minor girls to bring other\n18 minor girls to provide Epstein with sexualized massages.\n19 Again, based on the trial testimony and evidence, I\n20 overrule the objection. It supported the information in these\n21 paragraphs. The evidence indicated the scheme started with the\n22 defendant's recruitment of Virginia. Virginia then enlisted\n23 Carolyn in addition to at least two other girls. Carolyn in\n24 turn recruited at least three friends, and those friends then\n25 brought more girls.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00021554",
