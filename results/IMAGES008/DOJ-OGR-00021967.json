Thank you.\n3 I have a few responses. The first is, although I greatly appreciate when the parties are able to reach agreement on the terms of a defendant's release, that agreement is meaningful to me but it's certainly not controlling. I ultimately decide how defendants should be released. And there have been occasions where I've disagreed with an agreement between the parties. So the fact that you and the government reached agreement on certain terms, the terms that will be imposed may be different than that agreement. It's simply, the way that court proceeds. And the fact of the agreement - while very helpful and I appreciate it, and it suggests that the parties are working well together - doesn't necessarily mean that those are the conditions that I'm going to impose.\n16 The second thing to say with respect to the issue of firearms is that it is in fact a policy. It's not a policy of the U.S. Attorney's Office; it's a policy of our pretrial service office, because they are going to be sending officers in to enforce the terms of your client's release, and, as you said yourself, the world is crazy, and they have safety concerns, which isn't to say that they have specific safety concerns about Ms. Noel. And, as you point out, this case is not a violent case and there are not allegations that your client has engaged in violence, either in connection with this\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
