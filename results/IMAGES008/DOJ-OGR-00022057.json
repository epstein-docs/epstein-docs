In the meantime, the bureau has been relying on augmentation to temporarily fill correctional officer positions with other staff. Although Sawyer said this is a good process and all staff are trained for this role, she admitted the agency has to use augmentation more than is optimal and often employees are taken away from their designated work. In addition to hiring, Hawk Sawyer said the bureau is working to replace the surveillance cameras in all prisons, ensure that staff are thoroughly trained and have managers repeatedly tell staff what their responsibilities are. These are all issues that came to light in the wake of the Epstein scandal. As the hearing was going on the Justice Department indicted the two federal correctional officers on duty the night of Epstein's death with falsifying records to say they checked on him. Hawk Sawyer agreed with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that the Epstein situation was a \"black eye\" on the entire agency. Since the FBI and the Justice Department Inspector General are looking into the Epstein case she said he could not speak about any specifics. \"We have some bad staff,\" Hawk Sawyer said. \"We want rid of those bad staff who don't do their job. We want them gone one way or another either by prosecution or by termination. But the good staff are doing extraordinary work out there every day managing the 177,000 inmates. You never hear anything about those people.\" By Courtney Bublé November 19, 2019 https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2019/11/lack-staff-and-resources-continue-strain-federal-bureau-prisons/161398/ https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2019/11/lack-staff-and-resources-continue-strain-federal-bureau-prisons/161338/print/ 2/2 DOJ-OGR-00022057",
