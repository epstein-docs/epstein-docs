Section 3553(c)(2).\n\nThe conviction must be reversed and the indictment dismissed or, in the alternative, the matter should be remanded for the appropriate hearings.\n\nPOINT I\n(Point I in Appellant's Principal Brief)\nMS. MAXWELL IS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF A NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT WHICH, BY ITS TERMS, BARRED THE USAO-SDNY FROM PROSECUTING MS. MAXWELL FOR THESE OFFENSES.\n\nIn this Circuit, while ordinarily any plea or non-prosecution agreement is confined to enforcement in the district of origin, under U.S. v. Annabi, supra., there is an exception wherein \"it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction,\" as is the case here. See Annabi at 672. This exception dictates that the NPA be enforced to protect Ms. Maxwell as a third-party beneficiary to the agreement from prosecution for these offenses. See U.S. v.
