Due to conflicts in the Court's and the parties' availability in the third quarter of 2021, the Court, utilizing the procedures within this District governing the scheduling of jury trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, will instead seek to schedule a jury trial for the fourth calendar quarter of 2021.
