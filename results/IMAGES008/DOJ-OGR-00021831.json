New York, 404 U.S. 257, 261 (1971). Alternatively, the Court should limit Annabi as follows: Annabi should not apply (1) to plea agreements from other circuits that do not have such a rule; (2) to offenses based on the same conduct that was the subject of a non-prosecution or plea agreement; (3) where there are \"affirmative indications\" that the defendant reasonably understood the agreement to bind other districts; and (4) without discovery and an evidentiary hearing. Here, Annabi was applied to a plea that was negotiated and executed in the Eleventh Circuit (a circuit that does not follow Annabi); to an offense based on the same conduct that the \"United States\" had agreed not to prosecute; despite affirmative appearances of intent to bind other districts; and without discovery and a hearing.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-00021831",
