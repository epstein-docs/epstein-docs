This move is in addition to the FBI inquiry already underway. The FBI declined to comment about its investigation. \"I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody,\" Barr said. \"Mr. Epstein's death raises serious questions that must be answered.\" Neither the Justice Department not the inspector general's office immediately responded to the Washington Examiner's request for further details. The Bureau of Prisons released a statement on Saturday stating that the jet-setting financier and sex offender was found \"unresponsive in his cell\" located in the Special Housing Unit at around 6:30 a.m. this morning following \"an apparent suicide.\" Officials said lifesaving efforts were immediately undertaken and that emergency medical services were quickly called. Epstein was brought to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. Epstein reportedly hanged himself, and a gurney carrying Epstein's body was wheeled out of the Manhattan Correctional Center around 7:30 a.m. this morning, according to reports. According to a representative for NYC Office of Chief Medical Examiner who spoke with the Washington Examiner, \"there is no official cause of death yet\" as \"the medical examiner has to do their job.\" \"We are investigating the cause of death and we have an open case,\" the representative said. The 14-page indictment against Epstein alleged that he sexually exploited dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, among other locations, between 2002 and 2005 and perhaps beyond. Some of the victims were ostensibly as young as 14 at the time the alleged crimes occurred. Epstein allegedly \"created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit\"and \"maintained a steady supply of new victims.\" https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-announces-doj-inspector-general-investigation-into-epstein-death 1/3 DOJ-OGR-00022052",
