She also continued collecting records relating to Epstein's business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein's activity. On several occasions, Villafaña sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable national expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as whether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim's age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a prosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was expected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant procedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues; expected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by lower-level supervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and approval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Attorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafaña drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta, Sloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO's Criminal Division Chief the previous October, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May 1, 2007, supporting a proposed 60-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth legal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other statutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and potential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who were expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafaña's immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum, had only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The immediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the case was complex and that Villafaña would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and proposed indictment \"were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,\" but that he wanted to employ a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that presented \"the toughest cases\" for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already raised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some concerns about the case—particularly the government's ability to prevail on certain legal issues and the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as insurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require approval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that \"[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get-go,\" he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go forward with the prosecution.\n\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follow-up meeting with Lourie and Villafaña on February 20, 2007, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-00021225",
