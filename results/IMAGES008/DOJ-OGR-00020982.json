It does not support that an uncareful and inattentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury selection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 50 committed perjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury.

Juror 50's sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 50 was not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the actual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case participants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered \"yes (self)\" to Question 48, the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 50's personal history of sexual abuse. That Juror 50 was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was biased or failed to follow the Court's instructions during voir dire and the trial.
