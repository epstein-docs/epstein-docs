OVERVIEW\nFollowing the Miami Herald report in November 2018, media scrutiny of and public attention to the USAO's handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart of the public's concern is the perception that Epstein's 18-month sentence, which resulted in a 13-month term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein's criminal conduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from Epstein's conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making process leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff's motivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors and defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the NPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a \"sweetheart deal\" because they were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships with his attorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the following core questions: (1) who was responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its specific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules or regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by improper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness interviews shed light on these questions, OPR shows in detail the process that led to the NPA, from the initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process. After a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive interviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions concerning the NPA's origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth its conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\n\nII. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knowledge of its terms. He revised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that he either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the case against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled him about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta did not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the \"three pronged resolution, two years . . . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my authority. . . . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I . . . accept that I'm not . . . pushing away responsibility for it.\"\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually. Menchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña were involved in the matter to varying degrees, at\n\n133\nDOJ-OGR-00021333",
