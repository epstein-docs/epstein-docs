(See Br.79 (citing GX-662-R at 44)). The same is true regarding Maxwell's comparison of Counts Two and Four: in Maxwell's view, the jury rejected nearly all of the evidence of Maxwell's enticement of Jane to New York for lack of corroboration, and then convicted her based on an unsupported speculative leap about arranging an unidentified return flight from New Mexico. That is not plausible, and it certainly is not a \"substantially likely\" conclusion that can be drawn from an inscrutable jury note.\n\nFor similar reasons, no variance occurred. As discussed above, the proof at trial corresponded to the allegations in the Indictment, namely, evidence and argument that Maxwell enticed and transported Jane to New York in order to facilitate sexual abuse there. Maxwell was also well aware that the Government's proof would include conduct in New Mexico. (See A.117, 121-22, 126). Maxwell therefore had \"fair and adequate notice\" that the conspiracies included conduct at Epstein's New Mexico home, which is all that is required. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 608, 622 (2d Cir. 2003). In any event, the Government produced on November 6, 2021—more than three weeks before trial—notes from an interview with Jane describing sexual abuse in New Mexico. That is sufficient. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (rejecting a prejudice argument in part because \"[t]he government disclosed the evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial\").\n\nDOJ-OGR-00021735",
