But again, like if\nyou're going to serve jury duty, it might as well as be\nsomething that's interesting, but I did not set out in order to\nget on this jury.\nQ. Let me ask you to return to question 18A, page 24. You\nspoke to this a little bit but I want to make sure I understand\nthe answer.\nQ. You indicated that when you checked no, that was\nan inaccurate answer.\nA. I didn't see the part where it says, 'I was distracted by all the\nnoise going on around me.' I was just like 'no.' I said,\ncompletely skimmed way too fast. And again, I just\nwanted to get done with it.\nQ. Had you been sitting for hours, there were\nthree\naudiovisual problems\nI literally sat there for three\nhours, getting your video to play, so we\nI didn't have a phone, I didn't have a book, I was\nsitting there twiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up\nthat just happened a few weeks prior and I was sitting in my\nfeelings\nand not very focused.\nQ. So tell me what you understand to be asking for\ninformation to be asking about family or a friend.\nA. I thought it was asking for self? And the box that says yes for\nself? I just missed it.
