Absolutely not.\nQ. In responding to this question, did you answer no so as\nto make it more likely that you would be selected for the jury?\nA. Absolutely not, your Honor.\nQ. Did your history of sexual abuse motivate you in any way to\ntry to tailor your answers to make it more likely that you\nwould be selected for this jury?\nA. Not at all, your Honor.\nQ. At the time you filled out the questionnaire on November 4,\ndid it occur to you that you might personally benefit in any\nway from being on the jury in this case?\nA. Not at all, your Honor.\nQ. I'm going to return to question 25 again, which you have\nindicated was inaccurately responded to and again discussed this, but I want to just hear directly in response to\nthis question, why did you check no?\nA. Well, again, I don't really\nthink about abuse. I wasn't thinking about it because it doesn't\ndefine me today. It's something that happened, and I have lived through it, and I\nbecame the person I am today because of my goals and\nambitions. And I do not feel that I'm a victim of a crime,\neven though looking back on this abuse, that does make me a\nvictim of a crime, which is why I should have marked yes for\nself.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\n15\nM38TMAX1\n1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25\nQ.

So you learned of an inaccurate answer in an article about\nan interview?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And what about during the interview?\nA. No.\nQ. During the interview, when did you first learn that the questionnaire may contain\nquestions about sexual abuse history?\nA. That was during my Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins.\nQ. So we're talking about your response to 18 which you have\nindicated was inaccurate.
