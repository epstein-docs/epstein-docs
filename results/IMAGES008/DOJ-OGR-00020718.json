As indicated at yesterday's hearing, the Court has docketed the unredacted copy of the Court's February 24, 2022, Opinion & Order, the Government's proposed questions, the Defendant's proposed questions with limited redactions, the signed immunity order with limited redactions and Hearing Exhibit 1. The limited redactions to the signed immunity order and the Defendants proposed questions are narrowly tailored to further the interest of protecting juror anonymity. The Court will file the unredacted documents under seal. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/9/22)(jbo) (Entered: 03/09/2022)\n03/10/2022 640 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Per the Court's instruction at the March 8 hearing, the parties submitted revised redactions to their briefing on the Defendants motion for a new trial. The Court rejects the Defendant's proposed redaction to page 8, lines 6-7 of her reply because it is not necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity and privacy. See Dkt. No. 607. The Court concludes that the remaining proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to further the important interest of protecting juror anonymity and privacy. Press-Enter. Co. v.
