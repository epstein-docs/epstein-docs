The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited from the victim regarding Epstein's abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of the case or the victim's view about the prosecution of Epstein.433\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when she was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafaña told OPR that she believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued \"interviewing witnesses\" and \"doing all these things\" to file charges and prepare for a federal trial. As Villafaña stated, \"So to me, saying to a victim the case is now back under investigation is perfectly accurate.\"\n\nVillafaña was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with civil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims' attorneys about the NPA. In a 2017 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims' attorney Bradley Edwards alleged that during telephone calls with Villafaña, he \"asked very specific questions about what stage the investigation was in,\" and Villafaña replied that she could not answer his questions because the matter \"was an on-going active investigation.\" Edwards stated that Villafaña gave him \"the impression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously growing, both in the number of identified victims and complexity.\" Edwards also stated, \"A fair characterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafaña listened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.\"\n\nIn her written response to OPR, Villafaña stated that she \"listened more than [she] spoke\" during her interactions with Edwards and that due to the \"uncertainty of the situation\" and the possibility of a trial, she \"did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.\" Villafaña also told OPR that because of \"all of these concerns and instructions that I had been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any involvement in victim notification,\" she felt \"prohibited\" from providing additional information to Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO from exercising its discretion to notify the victims, \"[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to break down and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you're going to get $150,000, that's . . . going to be instant impeachment for the defense.\"434 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n\n433 As noted above, the FBI agent's notes for one victim's interview reported that she wanted another victim to be prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman responded that he \"was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn't get the sense that the victims were overly interested in showing up . . . at the change of plea.\"\n\n275\nDOJ-OGR-00021477",
