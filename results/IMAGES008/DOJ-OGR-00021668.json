(Tr.1191-93).\nWhen Kate was approximately 18 years old, she visited Epstein and Maxwell in Palm Beach. (Tr.1199). Maxwell left a schoolgirl outfit for Kate and said it would be fun for Kate to wear for Epstein. (Tr.1200-01). Kate-alone in a place she had never previously visited-complied. (Id.). Epstein initiated sexual con-tact with Kate and engaged in a sex act with her. (Tr.1202). Later that day, Maxwell asked Kate if she had fun and told Kate that she was a \"good girl\" and \"one of [Epstein's] favorites.\" (Tr.1202). Epstein en-gaged in unwanted sexual activity with Kate multiple times during that same trip. (Id.).\n3. Sexual Abuse of Annie Farmer\nMaxwell also took steps to normalize sexual contact with Annie Farmer, who was then 16 years old. Annie first met Epstein on a trip to New York, where she and her older sister visited Epstein's Manhattan town-house, and during which Epstein began to groom An-nie by stroking her hand and leg while watching a movie with her. (Tr.2056-61). In the spring of 1996, Annie's mother, at Epstein's request, agreed to send Annie to Epstein's ranch in New Mexico for a retreat for a group of students who were academically gifted. (Tr.2069-70, 2253-55). Annie felt more comfortable go-ing once she understood that Maxwell, a grown woman in a romantic relationship with Epstein, would be there. (Tr.2077).\nDOJ-OGR-00021668",
