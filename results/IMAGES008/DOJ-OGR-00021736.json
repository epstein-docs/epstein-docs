Applicable Law\nA district court commits procedural error if, among other things, it \"makes a mistake in its Guidelines calculation\" or \"fails adequately to explain its chosen sentence.\" United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 190 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc). This Court reviews a district court's\" application of the Guidelines de novo, while factual determinations underlying a district court's Guidelines calculation are reviewed for clear error.\" United States v. Cramer, 777 F.3d 597, 601 (2d Cir. 2015). In explaining the sentence, a district court must show that \"it has considered the parties' arguments and that it has a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decisionmaking authority.\" Cavera, 550 F.3d at 193.\nB. Discussion\nMaxwell argues that the District Court erred by applying a four-level leadership enhancement under ยง 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. That enhancement applies when a defendant was an \"organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was . . . otherwise extensive,\" which must include the defendant's leadership of at least one other criminal participant. U.S.S.G. ยง 3B1.1 & cmt. n.2. Maxwell contests only whether the evidence showed that she led another criminal participant. (Br.84-85).\nDOJ-OGR-00021736",
