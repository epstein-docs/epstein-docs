She has been dishonest with the Court, and she has\n3 made misrepresentations when it suits her. Your Honor, we\n4 recognize that the Court has calculated the guidelines to be\n5 188 to 235 months.

Our country now recognizes how woefully\n12 inadequate the 2003 guidelines were, and the Supreme Court has\n13 expressly held that sentencing courts can vary upwards for\n14 exactly that reason. Again, this is that case. This is\n15 exactly that case. This is the time to impose an\n16 above-guideline sentence. A guideline sentence in this case\n17 would create unwarranted sentencing disparities with\n18 individuals being sentenced today for sex-trafficking offenses.\n19 This case calls out for an above-guideline sentence because of\n20 the breathtaking scope of the defendant's conduct, the length\n21 of her crimes, the number of victims, the vulnerability of her\n22 victims, the sophistication of the defendant's predatory\n23 conduct and the degree to which she psychologically manipulated\n24 her victims.
