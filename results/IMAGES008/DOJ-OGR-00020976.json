In arguing that Juror 50's experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 50 was sexually abused as a minor on multiple occasions by \"two people who were friends\"—his stepbrother, who was \"someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,\" and the stepbrother's friend.
