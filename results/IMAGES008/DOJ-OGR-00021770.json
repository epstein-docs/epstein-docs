Certain life experiences create permanent biases. Nevertheless, it is this juror in this situation that the law would properly \"cautiously incapacitate\" because persons in such a situation would naturally feel prejudice. In his post-verdict interviews, Juror 50 admitted as much when he described how he identified with the Government witnesses through the lens of his own experience of child sexual abuse; convinced other jurors to credit the testimony of Government witnesses and discredit defense witnesses precisely because of his unique insight about memory for child sexual assault; and bonded so profoundly with the Government witnesses that he felt compelled to contact one after trial and to give interviews about his own experience.\nSuffice to say, this was not an example of an impartial juror using his \"life experiences\" in the performance of his civic duty, contrary to the Court's view.
