Michael Thomas is charged with certain crimes resulting from this same event.\n\nOn August 10, 2019, the Washington Examiner, reported under the headline: \"Barr announces DOJ inspector general investigation into Epstein death.\" (See Exhibit D.)

On the Wikipedia page entitled, \"Death of Jeffrey Epstein,\" the following appears, among other information: \"After initially expressing suspicion, Attorney General William Barr described Epstein's death as 'a perfect storm of screw-ups.'

Because the government has failed to meet the disclosure mandates of Rule 16 and Brady-Giglio, this motion seeks to compel the government to produce the following: 1) Inspector General's report investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein and the Bureau of Prisons' policies and procedures; 2) any reports, witness statements, memorandum, and documents from any separate investigation conducted by the BOP; and 3) any reports, witness statements and/or documents created by any other federal agencies that investigated the circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein that have not already been disclosed.\n\n1 See, YouTube clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI_haGuVBC4\n2 See, https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/11/us/jeffrey-epstein-investigation-us-marshals-documents/index.html\n3 See, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Jeffrey_Epstein\n4\nDOJ-OGR-00022031",
