We do understand of course that that may be difficult with Mr. Foy's trial schedule with having the July trial, but it seems like there may be a possibility of putting this trial before Mr. Foy's July trial and still giving him sufficient time to prepare for both.\n\nTHE COURT: And how long do you expect this trial to go?\n\nMS. LONERGAN: Your Honor, if this trial is confined to that 14-hour time period, setting aside jury selection, I can't imagine it lasting more than a week.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. The trial is set for June 8.\n\nWith respect to the motion to dismiss, the motion is due on March 9, opposition is due by April 6, and the reply is due on April 20.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
