Villafaña explained to Sloman:\n\nThe funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven't met) or spoken to [the private attorney] before I asked him if he would be willing to take on this case. . . . But as soon as you mentioned the appearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and agreed that the Special Master would be a safer route. I just worry that the defense's attacks on me could harm the victims.\n\nSloman responded that defense counsel had \"put an . . . insidious spin\" on Villafaña's role in proposing the private attorney, but Sloman added, \"I hope that you understand that these ad hominem attacks against you do not diminish in our eyes what you and the agents have accomplished.\"\n\n147 Acosta and Villafaña were copied on this email.\n148 The Addendum is attached as Exhibit 4 to this Report.\n\n93\nDOJ-OGR-00021293",
