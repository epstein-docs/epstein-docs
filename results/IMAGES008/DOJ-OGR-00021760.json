The Government, having received the totality of the benefit of the bargained elements in the NPA, should be held to its terms. There is no remedy other than enforcement of the NPA according to its terms or, should the Court determine that such terms are ambiguous, the holding of a hearing. Should the hearing establish that Epstein understood the co-conspirator clause to be global, while the Government deemed its reach a mistake or the subject of regret, Epstein, now dead, cannot undo it. The Government, having removed limiting language in the NPA, cannot restrict the NPA in retrospect, as it had convinced the District Court.\n\n12\nDOJ-OGR-00021760",
