That evening, Epstein returned to the SHU from his attorney visit and was escorted into his cell by TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and another officer at approximately 7:49 p.m. NOEL and the other officer left the tier in which Epstein was housed immediately thereafter.\n\n19. By or before 10 p.m., all inmates in the MCC were locked in their cells for the night. At or around that time, TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-2 were responsible for conducting the 10 p.m. institutional count in the SHU. However, video from the MCC's internal video surveillance system shows that NOEL and Officer-2 did not perform the 10 p.m. count. Nonetheless, NOEL and Officer-2 completed and signed a count slip falsely stating that the 10 p.m. institutional count had been performed. In reliance on that falsified count slip, at approximately 10:36 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 10 p.m. count.\n\n20. As reflected on video obtained from the MCC's internal video surveillance system, at approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9, 2019 - after TOVA NOEL, the defendant, had signed and submitted the 10 p.m. count slip and the institutional count had been completed - NOEL briefly walked up to, and then walked back from, the door to the tier in which Epstein was housed. As confirmed by the video obtained from the MCC's internal video surveillance system, this was the last time anyone, including any\n\n9\n\nDOJ-OGR-00021916",
