During his OPR interview, Menchel could not specifically recall why he believed it was \"premature\" to provide the defense with the requested information, but speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum had been circulated for Acosta to have made a decision about how he wanted to proceed. This recollection is consistent with the May 2007 emails reflecting that Acosta wanted time to consider the proposed prosecution.\n\nOn May 22, 2007, defense counsel Lefcourt emailed Lourie a letter to \"confirm\" that Epstein's attorneys would be given an opportunity to meet with Lourie before the USAO reached a final decision on charging Epstein. Lourie forwarded the letter to Menchel and Sloman, but noted that Epstein's defense team was \"really ready for the next level,\" rather than another meeting with him. Lourie suggested that Menchel meet with defense counsel, adding, \"Whether Alex would be present or grant them another meeting after that is his call.\" Lourie also emailed Lefcourt, clarifying that Lourie had not promised to call Epstein's counsel before filing charges, and suggesting that Epstein's counsel make their next presentation to Menchel.\n\nAlthough Lourie's emails show that he had no objection to more senior USAO managers meeting with defense counsel, Villafaña opposed such a meeting. Several emails indicate that Menchel traveled to West Palm Beach to meet with Lourie and Villafaña on the afternoon of May 23, 2007.48 On that same date, Villafaña drafted an email, which she planned to send to Sloman and Menchel, expressing her disagreement with meeting with defense counsel. Although the email was written for Sloman and Menchel, Villafaña sent it as a draft only to her immediate supervisor, seeking her \"guidance and counsel\" as to how to proceed.\n\nHi Jeff and Matt - I just want to again voice my disagreement with promising to have a meeting or having a meeting with Lefcourt or any other of Epstein's attorneys.

This is a case where the defendant is facing the possibility of dozens of years of prison time.
