(Rohrbach, Andrew) (Entered: 10/29/2021)\n10/29/2021 402 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of Defendant's letter regarding delivery of Defendant's legal mail at MDC. Dkt. No. 381 . The Government is hereby ORDERED to respond by Tuesday, November 2, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

No. 378, and the Defendant's motion in limine to exclude under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), Dkt. No. 386. The issues raised in the two motions overlap significantly. The Court is required under Federal Rule of Evidence 412 to conduct an in camera hearing. Fed. R. Evid. 412 (\"Before admitting evidence under this rule, the court must conduct an in camera hearing and give the victim and parties a right to attend and be heard. Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion, related materials, and the record of the hearing must remain under seal.). In addition, the Court has determined it will conduct a Daubert hearing with respect to the Defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Because of the overlap in the substance of the motions, the Court will conduct the two proceedings back to back. The Court previously set a tentative date for the Rule 412 Motion hearing as November 5, 2021. Dkt. No. 354. The Court is prepared to proceed with both hearings on that date. Alternatively, the proceedings could be held on either the afternoon of November 9 or the afternoon of November 10. The Government shall confer with its proposed expert regarding availability for the Daubert hearing as well as with alleged victims who wish to attend and be heard at the Rule 412 Motion hearing. After doing so, the parties shall confer with each other as to availability. On or before November 2, 2021, the parties shall jointly file a letter with the Court indicating whether the hearings be held on November 5, 9, or 10. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 10/31/2021) (bw) (Entered: 11/01/2021)\n11/01/2021 401 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' proposed redactions to the parties' motions in limine, responses in opposition, replies in support, and related exhibits. As the Court indicated at today's conference, some of the parties' proposed redactions are overbroad considering the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). In https://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?211087015221896-L_1_0-1 59/113 DOJ-OGR-00020681",
