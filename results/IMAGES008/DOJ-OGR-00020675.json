Nathan from Counsels of record for the Government dated 10/15/21 re: Government response to Order of The Court dated 10/15/21 (Dkt. No. 348).ENDORSEMENT: Based on the information in this letter the Court will not enter the Defendant's requested order. See Dkt. 346.

Going forward, if another delay occurs, the Defendant may renew the request for a specific order requiring delivery within the time frame. With this understanding and in light of the unusually early pre-trial disclosure schedule set by the Court, the Court remains confident that Ms. Maxwell and her attorneys are fully able to prepare for trial.
