The jurors had the mistaken impression that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found that Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, even though such conduct was not and could not have been “sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55.”\nThe corroborating evidence supports the theory that the jury did not credit Jane’s testimony that Maxwell participated in or helped arrange Jane’s sexual abuse in New York and was instead focused on her involvement in the New Mexico conduct. The most important piece of evidence corroborating Jane’s testimony were the flight logs kept by Epstein’s pilot, Dave Rodgers. See GX-662-R.
