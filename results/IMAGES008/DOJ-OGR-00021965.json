  "full_text": "Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 14 Filed 12/16/19 Page 7 of 12 7 JBJKNOEN With regards to the surrender of firearm, I'm asking that your Honor not make that a requirement of her release. I ask that because - in this nonviolent allegation, in which no firearm was involved, with a history of having no criminal record of any kind or any history of violence - she, who legally possesses and has a permit for the firearm, should still be able to possess her firearm because she's not a convicted felon and someone who's not permitted to do so. She's -- THE COURT: Is that a duty firearm or personal use? MR. FOY: Personal. So that's the only issue that I have, because I think that at this time, to sacrifice that right that she legally has, and has complied with everything that it means to have that firearm, that she still be able to do so. I could imagine that there could be an argument about safety of others; however, there's nothing to really corroborate the fact that her continuing to possess her firearm, just like she has in the past, would actually endanger anyone. We voluntarily surrendered. We participated in a pretrial interview. There's just no reason for it, other than probably a policy that says that's what they would like to do. Now, it's a meaningful one, I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, but under the unique circumstances here, in this case, in the history and type of case that it is, I'm asking SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
