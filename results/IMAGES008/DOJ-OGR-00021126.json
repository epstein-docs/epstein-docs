Ct. 845 (1984).\n\nIn any event, there was ample evidence establishing that Juror 50 harbored actual bias and that the similarities of his child sexual abuse to the case supported a finding of implied and inferred bias at the time of jury selection such that, had Juror 50 given truthful answers at the time of jury selection, Defendant would have interposed a valid challenge for cause. A new trial must be ordered.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\n“When it is discovered that a juror gave false answers during voir dire, any motion for a new trial must first be analyzed under the Supreme Court’s test in McDonough Power Equity v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (1984). Under a two-part test, a party must show that “a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556. Second, the party must show that “a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Id. Moreover, a new trial can be ordered without a finding of actual prejudice. Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 307-10 (1991). The standard of review for a district court’s denial of a motion for a new trial is abuse of discretion. See, Rivas v. Brattesani, 94 F.3d 802, 807 (2d. Cir. 1996).\n\n64\nDOJ-OGR-00021126",
