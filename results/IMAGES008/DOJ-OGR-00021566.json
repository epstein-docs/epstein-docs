The question is whether the\n13   factual record at trial establishes that the offense continued\n14   throughout the duration of 2004, which it emphatically did.\n15       The testimony of a crime victim who testified at this trial\n16   establishes that the offense conduct went past November 1,\n17   2004.\n18       THE COURT:  So I think the framing of the question\n19   here is very important and its technical -- this whole\n20   discussion is very technical.  It seems to me the question is\n21   can the government point to a preponderance of the evidence\n22   that conspiratorial conduct took place in this very small time\n23   window, basically November and December 2004.
