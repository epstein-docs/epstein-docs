Maxwell argues that this agreement, which neither she nor the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York signed, nevertheless bars her prosecution in the Southern District of New York in this case, and she twice sought dismissal of the charges in the Indictment on that ground. The District Court denied the motions to dismiss, correctly recognizing that Maxwell's argument is precluded by the text of the agreement and this Court's longstanding precedent. Accordingly, this Court should affirm the denial of the motions to dismiss.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00021673",
