See Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d at 583-84; Levin, 2016 WL 2990831, at *12. Evidence on those points does not relate to whether the defendant committed the crimes charged, but rather is intended to elicit sympathy, compassion, or compromise from the jury. The records Thomas seeks are no more discoverable than the nullification evidence precluded in Armstrong and its progeny.

Delacruz, No. 14 Cr. 815 (KBF), 2015 WL 2211943, at *4 (S.D.N.Y.
