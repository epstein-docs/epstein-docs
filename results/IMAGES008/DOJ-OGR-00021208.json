JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1953.4 Although he did not graduate from college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhattan from 1974 until 1976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street firm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited partner before leaving in 1981. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear, Epstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur through whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtown Manhattan, where he resided. In the early 1990s, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also owned a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled among his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other entities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and extent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.5 He associated with prominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and engaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including housekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom traveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein's Defense Attorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense attorneys in responding to the allegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach, Florida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the allegations, he added attorneys having particular relevant knowledge of, or connections with, those entities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami criminal trial attorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense attorney who was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Attorney, and by nationally prominent Harvard Law School professor and criminal defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, who was a self-described close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Attorney's Office, Epstein replaced the local attorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal defense attorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Attorney handling the Epstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Attorney was removed from the Epstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent attorney who began representing Epstein during the state investigation was New York City attorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n\n4 Epstein's background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas Jr., \"Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,\" New York, Oct. 28, 2002; Vicky Ward, \"The Talented Mr. Epstein,\" Vanity Fair, Mar. 2003; James Barron, \"Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and Lurid Accusations,\" New York Times, July 9, 2019; Lisette Voytko, \"Jeffrey Epstein's Dark Façade Finally Cracks,\" Forbes, July 12, 2019.\n\n5 After Epstein's death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and trust documents. https://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-00021208",
