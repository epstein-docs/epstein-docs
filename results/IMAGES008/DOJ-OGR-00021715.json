At the hearing, Judge Nathan asked Juror 50 the questions she asked other jurors who indicated a personal experience with sexual assault or abuse. She concluded that \"Juror 50's credible responses [to those questions] under oath at the hearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\" (A.340). As Judge Nathan explained, other jurors who answered the questions similarly were not even challenged for cause, and she would not have granted a challenge had one been made. (A.344-45). She also rejected the notion that mere similarities between Juror 50's life experiences and the issues at trial required her to excuse Juror 50 for cause. (A.346).\nDOJ-OGR-00021715",
