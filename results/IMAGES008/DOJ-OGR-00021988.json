What I'm suggesting to your Honor in the least restrictive manner is that we can make sure that if anyone from pretrial services comes to the home, that she will secure the gun away so that it's not out, since that seems to be their concern.\nShe doesn't have any ill will towards the court staff or anyone a part of this process. She understands what she needs to do. There is no actual, credible, competent threat supported by evidence to suggest that at this time her constitutional right to possess her weapon should be infringed at this time.\nI suppose there could come a time where that could change, but when we take it now, without an individual assessment of her particulars, her background, the specific circumstances of the case, then it gives the impression as if the conclusion's foregone that she should be -- meaning in this case -- a felon deprived of her firearm. She's not. She remains innocent as we sit here today, and the fact that she's here is disappointing, but we're here, so we have to deal with it.\nAll I'm asking for is fair consideration in an individualized way. Any concern that your Honor has about her possessing a firearm, I'd welcome you to address it with me so I have an opportunity to directly speak to your concerns.\nTHE COURT: I'll hear from the government.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
