I can't quite tell from the papers whether -- I know you\n2 say the bequest is likely to be contested. What is the current\n3 status of the bequest?\n4 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, my understanding is that\n5 the document says what it says, and the estate is undergoing\n6 bankruptcy proceedings. I don't believe there is any -- this\n7 issue has been addressed because I think the estate is still\n8 dealing with victims' claims and other claims against the\n9 estate. But because it's in bankruptcy, I assume that this\n10 will be contested, and we don't know if there will be any money\n11 left at the end of that proceeding to honor the bequest. So\n12 that's one of the many reasons why I think this is such a\n13 tenuous asset that it shouldn't be considered for purposes of\n14 fines.\n15 THE COURT: It's listed as an asset in the financial\n16 affidavit, is it not?\n17 MR. EVERDELL: It is, your Honor, because we felt we\n18 wanted to fully disclose everything we know about, and we do\n19 know about simply because we were produced that document. We\n20 didn't know about it before. We knew about it because we got\n21 it in discovery, and we saw it was there, so we felt in good\n22 faith, we had to list it or at least disclose it, but I don't\n23 think it should be considered for purposes of fine.\n24 THE COURT: Ms. Moe, do you want to respond to that?\n25 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I don't have additional\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00021597",
