Two witnesses, both pilots for Epstein, testified that Kellen was Maxwell's assistant. (A.417; see Tr.139-40, 1890). Judge Nathan found that testimony credible, in part because it was corroborated by other testimony that Maxwell was Epstein's \"number two and the lady of the house\" in Palm Beach where much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen worked. (A.417). The trial evidence showed that Kellen scheduled sexualized massages and took nude photographs of Carolyn. (PSR ¶ 66; Tr.1554-55). Even after Kellen took over some of Maxwell's duties, Maxwell continued to manage her by virtue of her position in the house, a fact corroborated by a household manual directing staff to tend to the specific needs of Epstein, Maxwell, and their guests, as well as flight records showing that Maxwell and Kellen flew together on Epstein's planes dozens of times. (A.417). The clear inference from this record is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding how to schedule massages and run the part of the scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls to schedule appointments following Maxwell's directions. Maxwell argues that Judge Nathan erred because a defense witness testified that she, rather than Kellen, was Maxwell's assistant. (Br.85). That uncorroborated testimony is not enough to render Judge Nathan's finding clearly erroneous. Moreover, what matters is whether Maxwell exercised supervisory authority over Kellen, not whether Kellen or another individual was formally Maxwell's assistant.\n\nMaxwell also argues that when imposing the 240-month sentence, which was above the Guidelines",
