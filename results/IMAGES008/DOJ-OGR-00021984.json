FIGGINS: Your Honor, to be more specific, one of\n5    the issues here is going to be the conditions and the\n6    supervision and the policies that were upheld and advanced by\n7    the Bureau of Prisons. That is what the inspector general's\n8    report is investigating. That's very important information\n9    that's relevant to this case and relevant to the defense. I'm\n10   not saying we have to hold up our case forever, but we should\n11   at least get some type of idea as to the status of that report\n12   and when it's going to come out or when they're going to\n13   complete the actual report because I believe that there's going\n14   to be a lot of information that may be relevant to our defense,\n15   and it may not be specifically just about this particular\n16   investigation.\n17       There's been multiple information in the media now\n18   with respect to testimony by the head of the Bureau of Prisons,\n19   information released by the U.S. Attorney himself regarding\n20   this investigation with respect to this case, so I believe that\n21   we will need that information.
