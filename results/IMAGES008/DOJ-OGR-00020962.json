No. 649.\nJuror 50 certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court's questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 50 would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 50's responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf. Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App'x 10, 12 (2d Cir. 2020)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness's testimony as \"rehearsed\" where that witness\ndid \"what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing\"). As for being \"self-serving,\" as noted above, Juror 50's personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 50 \"did not see the word 'you'\nand the answer 'Yes (self)'\" for Question 48.

Yet the Court, in several lines\nof questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 50's testimony and is satisfied by his\nanswers. The Court first observed to Juror 50 that throughout the questionnaire, he \"appeared to\nhave followed the instructions.\" Hearing Tr. at 19. When asked how he correctly followed the\ninstructions elsewhere, Juror 50 explained, as he had previously in his testimony, that for\nquestions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he \"was still . . . in focus\" and so more able to\nrespond accurately.
