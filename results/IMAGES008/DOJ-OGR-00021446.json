Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission of the NPA; a written apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta, Villafaña, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials; training for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and attorneys' fees.387\n\nFollowing Epstein's indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death while in custody, on September 16, 2019, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied the petitioners' motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein's death \"rendered the most significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government's violation of Petitioners' rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.\"388 The court did not order the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it \"fully expects the Government will honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper treatment of crime victims.\"389 The court also denied the petitioners' request for attorneys' fees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, \"[a]lthough unsuccessful on the merits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.\"\n\nOn September 30, 2019, Wild appealed the district court's rejection of the requested remedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.390 In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and \"regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.\"391 Nevertheless, the government argued that, \"as a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not attach prior to the government charging a case\" and thus, \"the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because no criminal charges were brought.\"392 The government conceded, however, that with regard to the New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, \"[p]etitioner and other Epstein\n\n387 Doe, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2's Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2019).\n388 Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. 16, 2019).
