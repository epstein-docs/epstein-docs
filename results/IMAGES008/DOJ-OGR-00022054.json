The Justice Department said in February that it had also launched an internal inquiry into the handling of the Epstein case at the federal level, but the status of that investigation is not known.\nEpstein was arrested at the airport in Teterboro, New Jersey after returning from an overseas trip to Paris in early July. Epstein's home in New York City was raided by law enforcement as well, and investigators found nude photographs of underage girls, thousands of dollars in cash, dozens of loose diamonds, and a foreign passport from the 1980s with Epstein's picture and a false name.\nEpstein's lawyers had argued that Epstein should be allowed out on house arrest, asking the court to let him await trial in his Manhattan mansion. That request was denied. Besides his New York City mansion, Epstein also had an estate in Palm Beach, maintained a ranch in New Mexico, had a luxury apartment in Paris, and owned a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nIn denying him bail earlier this month, the judge said that Epstein posed a \"significant\" danger to the community and agreed with prosecutors that he was a serious flight risk.\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-announces-doj-inspector-general-investigation-into-epstein-death\n3/3\nDOJ-OGR-00022054",
