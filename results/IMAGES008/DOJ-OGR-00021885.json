On March 8, 2022, the District Court held a hearing and Juror 50 testified —under grant of immunity—that his answers to three questions related to sexual abuse in the jury questionnaire were not accurate but that the answers were an inadvertent mistake and that his experiences did not affect his ability to be fair and impartial. Finding Juror 50's testimony to be credible, the District Court denied Maxwell's motion for a new trial in a written order. Maxwell was subsequently sentenced to a term of 240 months' imprisonment to be followed by five years' supervised release, and the 8 Question 2 asked \"[h]ave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of a crime?\" Question 48 asked \"[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?
