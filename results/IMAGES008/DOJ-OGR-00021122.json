We agree. See Stogner, 539 U.S. at 632. But the Government's reliance on Ex Post Facto principles is misdirection. As Richardson, Gentile, and Schneider illustrate, the Ex Post Facto Clause is not the final word on whether a statute is impermissibly retroactive.

Because it accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity will generally coincide with legislative and public expectations. Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price *273 to pay for the countervailing benefits.\n\nLandgraf, 511 U.S. at 272-73 (emphasis in original; bold added).11 This view was echoed by no less a jurist than Judge Calabresi, who opined that \"[Landgraf's] anti-retroactivity presumption is triggered by statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto, nevertheless would\n\n11 Landgraf cannot be distinguished in this regard simply because it was a civil case. Non-criminal statutes, like criminal statutes, can be unconstitutionally retroactive (i.e. under the Takings or Due Process Clauses), but the constitutional standard is different from the Landgraf test.
