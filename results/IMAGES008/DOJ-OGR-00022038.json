Furthermore, the government had Mr. Thomas sign a consent form specifically from the Inspector General's office. (See Exhibit C.) Thereafter, the government turned over the results of this search in the normal course of discovery production. This fact shows that the Inspector General was investigating this incident thus all information they receive is discoverable.

Bryan sought discovery, under Rule 16(a)(1)(C) of items that were in the possession of the FBI. The charges against Bryan stemmed from the IRS investigation, and this difference, together with the further objection that production should be limited only to documents found in the District in which the matter was pending, Oregon, formed the basis of the government's objection.\n\n11\nDOJ-OGR-00022038",
