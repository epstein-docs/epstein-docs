Counts Three and Four Are Offenses Involving the Sexual Abuse of a Child\nMaxwell's entire argument is based on a mistaken premise: that the phrase \"offense involving the sexual . . . abuse . . . of a child,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3283, only encompasses crimes in which \"unlawful sexual activity actually took place.\" (Br.44). This flawed proposition ignores relevant statutory definitions, which make clear that Section 3283 reaches more broadly to include offenses in which there was no completed illegal sex act.\nAs described above, Section 3283 was originally codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k).
