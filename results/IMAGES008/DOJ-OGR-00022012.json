You said we dealt with\n3 the issue with respect to the Investigator General's report.\n4 This court has never addressed it at all. You never said\n5 anything with respect to that. So I just want to make that\n6 clear. Do I need to file a motion with respect to that.\n7 THE COURT: You may file a formal motion.\n8 MR. FIGGINS: Thank you.\n9 THE COURT: Anything further?\n10 MR. FIGGINS: Your Honor, can I have an additional two\n11 weeks? Can we push the motion schedule back at least an\n12 additional two weeks? Because I have my 80-something-year-old\n13 relative coming to visit me from February 23 through March 1,\n14 so I kind of won't be working during that time. So if you\n15 could just make it like -- if you could make it something\n16 around like the 18th or the 21st.\n17 THE COURT: All right, then. You can file your motion\n18 by March 20.\n19 How long does the prosecution need to oppose?\n20 MS. LONERGAN: Your Honor, three weeks, please.\n21 THE COURT: So the prosecution will file opposition on\n22 April 10, and the reply will be April 24.\n23 Is there anything further?\n24 MS. LONERGAN: Yes, your Honor, at this time the\n25 government moves to exclude time between now and the trial\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00022012",
