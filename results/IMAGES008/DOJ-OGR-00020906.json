MOE:\nThank you, your Honor.\nTHE COURT:\nAnd then I will believe he mentioned something about his interview with the journalist Lucia, first name Lucilla, and that this was an issue in the questionnaire. But I believe the reporting is that they discussed this at length, the consequences of him going public and the consequences of there were answers to jury questionnaire at issue here and about those questions that he would be talking about. I can't remember exactly what it is, but there was some discussion about the consequences of him going forward. And I believe what he said was: I didn't have any discussions or any lengthy discussions with the journalists about the consequences, about whether he just answered their questions. But I believe there was a discussion with Lucia, about -- I don't remember now -- what you're referring to. I don't understand what he wants to do.\nTHE COURT:\nOkay.\nMR. EVERDELL:\nI think the issue is he was saying how he didn't expect to be public, he didn't expect to be known worldwide as a victim of sexual abuse, that he didn't expect this to come out, even though he's talking to journalists. My understanding is he had a discussion with Lucia, the journalist\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

I think we also need some follow-up questions in our letter about his belief victim memory, because I think that goes to his ability to evaluate the evidence fairly and impartially.\nTHE COURT:\nI will deny that.\nMR. EVERDELL:\nI believe also he said in his answers on the jury but if he is going to be paraphrasing, it might be something interesting. I think we need some follow-up about the import of his comment. Was it interesting? Was it that he found this of the fact that it involved victims of sexual abuse, and because he was the victim of sexual abuse himself that made it interesting for him?\nTHE COURT:\nI will ask him what he meant.\nMS. STERNHAIN:\nI may have an issue, the last question about following your instructions. I think he said no. And insofar as saying no, how did he filled out the questionnaire?
