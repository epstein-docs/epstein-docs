And the Government consistently represented to the court, in numerous conferences and filings, that a conviction under the Mann Act counts had to be based on an intent or an agreement to violate New York Penal Law §130.55.

If Maxwell were convicted on Counts Three or Four based solely on such conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment.
