The Court concluded that, because the conspiracy alleged in the SDNY indictment \"extended for an additional two years\" beyond the date of the conspiracy alleged in the EDNY indictment, \"the new charges are sufficiently distinct at least to warrant application of [this] rule concerning construction of plea agreements.\" Id.\n\nAnnabi has been sharply criticized. One circuit said it was \"unable to discern a sound basis for the [Annabi] rule,\" adding that the decision \"really has no analytically sound foundation.\" U.S. v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 547 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nAnnabi cited three prior cases from this Circuit in support of the rule. 771 F.2d at 672 (citing U.S. v. Abbamonte, 759 F.2d 1065 (2d Cir. 1985); U.S. v.

The court in Alessi relies upon Papa, which is a related case. ...\n\nPapa, however, provides no support for the rule the Second Circuit follows. ... Although Papa held that the plea agreement did not bind other districts because the evidence revealed an intent to bind only one district, the Second Circuit apparently has broadly interpreted this case as meaning that plea agreements do not bind other districts absent an 9\n\nDOJ-OGR-00021838",
