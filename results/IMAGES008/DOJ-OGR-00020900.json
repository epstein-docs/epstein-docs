I really don't think about my sexual abuse, period. I don't tell very many people.\nQ. After the trial you gave interviews, in which you did tell people about your history of sexual abuse.\nA. Yes.\nQ. How do you reconcile what you just said with that?\nA. So I didn't -- this is going back to a deliberation thing, so I have to think about how to say this. I don't want to talk about it, but --\nQ. Well, if you can, you just said you don't talk about it. I only talk about my abuse, I could say that -- I didn't talk to a reporter in order to insert anything, I used it in order to talk to a sportscaster about jury deliberations, I didn't use it in order to insert anything, I just gave that as to why I believe in a certain way based on all the evidence that was provided during the trial.\nQ. I suppose that the question is: I was prepared for the public and you knew you were giving national and international media interviews, you were prepared for your history of sexual abuse to be widely known.\nA.

Looking again at 48, which has sort of a lot of white space for the answer there, do you see that?\nQ. And again, this is how many of the questions were structured: Check box yes, self, yes friend or family, yes friend or family.\nA. I just read the friend or family, again, like distracted, so I missed that \"have you or family,\" and then \"yes self\" while reading this question.\nQ. At the time you were filling this out, were you surprised you didn't honestly think about friend and family but not about it?\nA. At the time you filled out the questionnaire, did you think that your history of sexual abuse would be something that parties and I would want to know in order to determine if you could be fair and impartial?\nA.
