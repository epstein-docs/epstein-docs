The Court addresses first the documentary evidence. First, the Defendant does not attest, or even suggest, what the absent documents are likely to show.

At trial, the Government elicited testimony that flight manifests from before September 11, 2001, were far less detailed than modern manifests. E.g., Trial Tr. at 2518–22.

The Defendant does not explain what additional information would have been contained in official property records.\n\nSecond, even if more detail of the contents of these documents were presented, the Defendant fails to show why the evidence, if admitted at trial, would have benefitted her case. The Defendant's motion presumes that each piece of missing evidence would have favored her: an absence of payments by Epstein to the Defendant, an absence of phone calls from the Defendant to victims, an absence of the victims on detailed flight manifests.
