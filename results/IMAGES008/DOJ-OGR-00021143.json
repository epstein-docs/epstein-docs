Indeed, although Jane had previously told the FBI about the trip to New Mexico, she had denied being sexually abused there. It was not until just before trial, that Jane claimed for the first time that she had engaged in sexual activity with Epstein while she was at the ranch.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Maxwell's convictions on Counts Three and Four were based on a constructive amendment to the charged offenses.
