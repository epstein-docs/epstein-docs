FIGGINS: Your Honor, I would think it would\n2 probably be about five days on our case.\n3 And your Honor, I did want to ask the Court or we\n4 would like to at least get some type of idea with respect to\n5 the status of the inspector general's report. I do think that\n6 it's beyond relevant; it's an investigation into what happened\n7 here. There's going to be multiple details of information and\n8 interviews and statements and things of that nature regarding\n9 this particular case, so on and so forth. So I would ask at\n10 least the Court to see if we can get a time frame from the\n11 government if that report is going to be imminently due or what\n12 type of time frame we're looking at, because I do believe there\n13 are going to be a lot of relevant facts in that report, that we\n14 would need that information. And then we would need time to\n15 then maybe even investigate based on some of that information.\n16 THE COURT: Does the government know anything about that?\n17 that?\n18 MS. DONALESKI: Your Honor, I don't. And I'll just\n19 clarify that to the extent counsel's asking for a summary of\n20 the results of the criminal investigation, obviously we'll be\n21 turning over in discovery all of the underlying results of the\n22 criminal investigation. So I'm a little puzzled as to what\n23 defense counsel is saying that he needs. I don't have a time\n24 frame on the inspector general report, but the government will\n25 produce to the defense all of the relevant discovery materials\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00021983",
