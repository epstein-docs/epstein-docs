Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally known New York criminal defense attorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer to dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by attacking the credibility of the victim witnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Attorney's Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the case to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2016, his office prosecuted minors as young as 14 for prostitution.10 The possibility that Epstein's victims themselves could have been prosecuted caused \"great consternation within the office,\" and according to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.11 Belohlavek told OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein \"seriously, because . . . it was an organized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money.

Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable by imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.12 Under Florida law, however, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death penalty case.13 For all other cases, a State Attorney has concurrent authority to file criminal charges by means of a document called an \"information\" or to seek a grand jury indictment. Although Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often utilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by public officials.14 Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\n\n10 Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\n\n11 Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Attorney's Office's handling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR his office's prosecutorial decisions.\n\n12 U.S. Const. amend.
