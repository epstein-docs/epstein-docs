With respect to\n2 whether this information should be in the PSR, I think the\n3 Court is exactly right. This is listed on an asset on her\n4 balance sheet. Whether she ultimately recovers that amount or\n5 not, it's listed in the same way that liabilities are listed\n6 even though it may be uncertain as to how those are resolved.\n7 So I don't think the objection is founded.\n8 THE COURT: Yes, I'm going to overrule this objection\n9 to the PSR paragraph. It is included as an asset in\n10 Ms. Maxwell's financial aid affidavit. The uncertain assertion\n11 that she may lose the asset is not a basis to exclude it from a\n12 considered asset for purposes of determining a fine.\n13 Paragraph 178, the assertion here is that she is\n14 unable to pay a fine.\n15 Do I have that right, Mr. Everdell?\n16 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.\n17 THE COURT: I overrule the objection. Section\n18 5E1.2(a) of the Guidelines requires the Court to impose a fine\n19 in all cases except where the defendant establishes that she is\n20 unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\n21 The defendant has failed to establish this. As I just noted,\n22 there is a $10 million bequest from Epstein this is in addition\n23 to other assets noted in the PSR.\n24 I will say the assets and finances have been a moving\n25 target. In July 2020, Ms. Maxwell reported $3.8 million in\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00021598",
