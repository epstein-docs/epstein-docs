Maxwell instructed Annie to hold Epstein's foot and showed her how to give Epstein a foot massage. (Tr.2083-84). Maxwell then offered to give Annie a massage. (Tr.2084-85). After telling Annie to get undressed, Maxwell gave Annie a massage on a massage table while Annie was naked. (Tr.2085). During the massage, Maxwell directed Annie to roll over so that Annie was laying on her back. (Id.). After Annie complied and rolled to her back, Maxwell pulled the sheet down and exposed Annie's breasts. (Id.). Then, while Annie was naked, Maxwell rubbed Annie's breasts. (Tr.2085-86).\n\nDuring this same New Mexico trip, Epstein later got into Annie's bed, cuddled with her, pressed his body into her, and rubbed against her. (Tr.2086-87, 2224). But when Annie managed to extricate herself from the situation by running to the bathroom, thereby denying Epstein further sexual contact, Maxwell seemed \"very disinterested\" in Annie for the remainder of the trip. (Tr.2086-88).\n\n4. Sexual Abuse of Virginia Roberts\n\nBeginning in or about the summer of 2000, Maxwell and Epstein entered a new phase of their scheme to sexually abuse teenage girls. That summer, Maxwell recruited a 17-year-old girl named Virginia Roberts from the parking lot of Mar-a-Lago to provide Epstein with massages. (Tr.840-46). Over the next several months, Virginia was paid to provide Epstein with sexualized massages at his Palm Beach residence, in\n\nDOJ-OGR-00021669",
