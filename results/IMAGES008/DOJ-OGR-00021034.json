But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really\n8 didn't know what her role was, and his best recollection was\n9 that she was an assistant for Epstein.\n10 And again, just look again at Kimberley Espinosa's\n11 testimony who was the actual assistant for Ms. Maxwell, and she\n12 says unequivocally, \"I was her assistant. Kellen was Epstein's\n13 assistant.\" So there is no fair inference that Ms. Maxwell was\n14 supervising Sarah Kellen. The inference is exactly the\n15 opposite, and it can't provide a basis for that leadership\n16 enhancement.\n17 THE COURT: All right. Anything further on the\n18 enhancements for the government's objection?\n19 MS. MOE: Your Honor, just very briefly with respect\n20 to the leadership question, I just want to direct the Court's\n21 attention, we noted this on page 27 of our brief, but the\n22 testimony at trial was that Carolyn recalled that even after\n23 Sarah Kellen took over calling to schedule massages, Maxwell\n24 was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn\n25 arrived for massage appointments.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00021034",
