Rule 404(b) material\nMaxwell's final discovery request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government seeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). Under Rule 404(b), if the prosecutor in a criminal case intends to use \"evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act\" against a defendant, the prosecutor must \"provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial\" and must \"do so in writing before trial—or in any form during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.\" The Government represents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 404(b) evidence at least 45 days in advance of trial to allow Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final pretrial conference. The Government's proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge admission of that evidence and to bring to the Court's attention any issues that require resolution before trial. \"This is all that Rule 404(b) requires.\" United States v. Thompson, No. 13-cr-378 (AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013). The Court concludes this schedule is generally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of trial is strongly encouraged.\nThe Court's denial of Maxwell's requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude the parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account for Maxwell's specific concerns. \"[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to the benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court.\" United States v. Percevault, 490 F.2d 126, 132 (2d Cir. 1974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus schedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the disclosure of all of the above materials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient.\n32\nDOJ-OGR-00020791",
