Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for the MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants in part the Government's redaction and sealing requests. Its conclusion is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court concludes that these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access attach. Id. at 11920. In balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forward in this letter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrowly tailored redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995). Similarly, the Court concludes that the Government has shown that Exhibits E, F, G, H, and I should be filed under seal. With respect to Exhibit C, however, the Court concludes that narrowly tailored redactions are sufficient to advance the privacy interests the Government has identified. Accordingly, the Government is ORDERED to confer with defense counsel and submit proposed redactions to Exhibit C by May 20, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
