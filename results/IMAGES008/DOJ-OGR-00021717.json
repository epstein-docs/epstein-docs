Second, the party must show \"that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\" Id. To satisfy this prong, a court must determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would have granted a hypothetical strike for cause. United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 304 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on \"narrowly specified, provable and legally cognizable bases.\" United States v. Torres, 128 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. 1997). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three \"limited\" categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Id. \"Actual bias is bias in fact—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.\" Id. Implied bias, also called \"presumed bias,\" is \"bias conclusively presumed as a matter of law.\" Id. at 45. This Court has emphasized that this category is \"narrow,\" and \"reserved for 'exceptional situations,'\" generally meaning circumstances in which jurors \"are related to the parties\" or \"were victims of the alleged crime itself.\" Id. at 45-46.
