Attempting to undermine the clear legislative intent, Maxwell argues that the amendment did not apply to her case because her crimes both pre-dated the amendment and did not involve sexual abuse. These arguments fly in the face of the statutory text, legislative history, this Court's own decisions, and the persuasive authority of other Circuits. The charges fell squarely within the amended statute of limitations, and this Court should affirm Judge Nathan's well-reasoned decisions denying Maxwell's motions to dismiss the charges as untimely.\n\nA.
