Because Congress has expressly extended the statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, Judge Nathan correctly resolved this analysis at Landgraf step one.

Landgraf Step Two\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf, \"[e]ven absent specific legislative authorization,\" applying a statute to pre-enactment conduct \"is unquestionably proper in many situations.\" 511 U.S. at 273. \"A statute does not operate 'retrospectively' merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute's enactment, or upsets expectations based in prior law.\" Id. at 269. Instead, the question is whether the statute \"would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\" Id. at 280. Importantly, \"the fact that a new procedural rule was instituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does not make application of the rule at trial retroactive,\" because parties have \"diminished reliance interests in matters of procedure\" and \"[b]ecause rules of procedure regulate secondary rather than primary conduct.\" Id. at 275.\n\nIn Vernon v.
