STERNHEIM: Your Honor, I would just like to make\n3 one statement, if I may. With regard to the fine, the Court\n4 indicated the bequest in the will. I just want the record to\n5 reflect that that is an unactualized bequest, as Ms. Maxwell\n6 has received nothing, and it is the expectation that she will\n7 receive nothing.\n8 THE COURT: I understand. And to be clear, I am not\n9 finding and accept that she hasn't received anything, but there\n10 have only been nonspecific claims that she won't receive\n11 anything and there are additional assets that lead me to the\n12 conclusion that she is able to pay the fine.\n13 MS.
