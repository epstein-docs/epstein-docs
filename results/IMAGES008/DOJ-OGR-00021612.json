Just hours\n12 later, you and he abused me together for the first time.\n13 Together you damaged me physically, mentally, sexually and\n14 emotionally. Together you did unthinkable things that still\n15 have a corrosive impact on me to this day.\n16 I want to be clear about one thing: Without question,\n17 Jeffrey Epstein was a terrible pedophile, but I never would\n18 have met Jeffrey Epstein if not for you. For me, and for so\n19 many others, you opened the door to hell, and then, Ghislaine,\n20 like a wolf in sheep's clothing, you used your femininity to\n21 betray us and you led us all through it. When you did that,\n22 you changed the course of our lives forever. You joked that\n23 you were like a new mother to us. As a woman, I think you\n24 understood the damage that you were causing, the price you were\n25 making us victims pay. You could have put an end to the rapes,\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
