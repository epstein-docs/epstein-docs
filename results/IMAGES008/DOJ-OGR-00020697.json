The Court will send the temporarily sealed Memorandum Opinions and Orders to the parties. By November 24, 2021, the parties are ORDERED to inform the Court whether either seeks sealing or limited redactions of the Memorandum Opinions and Orders, justifying any such request by reference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). In addition, by that date, the parties are FURTHER ORDERED to file any proposed redactions to the moving papers and/or supporting exhibits on the public docket, again justifying any such request by reference to the Lugosch test.

Nathan from AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated November 22, 2021 re: Proposed Redactions. The Court is in receipt of the Government's Administrator Feldman's, and two anticipated witnesses' motions to quash the Defendant's Rule 17(c)(3) subpoena. Dkt. No. 486. The motions to quash are DENIED. The Court hereby ORDERS the Administrator of the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program to produce to the Court via electronic thumb drive any materials responsive to the subpoena as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 p.m. on November 24, 2021. Accordingly, the parties shall negotiate a protective order and submit the proposal for approval by the Court no later than 12:00 p.m. on November 24, 2021 (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Br., Ex. 1 (\"Notice\"). Two of those experts, Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, are expected to offer opinions that rebut opinions of the Government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio. The Government on November 8, 2021, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony of Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that motion. On November 15, 2021, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude the testimony of the remaining six experts. The Defense filed a response on November 19, 2021. The Court addressed the admissibility of Dr. Ryan Hall in a separate written opinion. In this opinion, the Court addresses the preliminary admissibility of Bennett Gershman based on the parties' current proffers...[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... III. Conclusion. The Court therefore grants the Government's motion to preclude Gershman's expert testimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and circumstances at trial would alter the Court's analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-raise its request to admit Gershman as an expert witness. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
