In the early phase of the conspiracy, between 1994 and 2001, Maxwell and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (Tr.295, 1178, 2051-52). Maxwell and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99, 1175-82, 2069-70, 2077-79). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them gifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (Tr.298-303, 348, 2079-81). Maxwell and Epstein then normalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (Tr.300-01, 2081-84). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse, often through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage.
