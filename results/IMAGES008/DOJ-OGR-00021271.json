I was hoping to work only a half day tomorrow to save my voice for Tuesday's hearing . . . , if necessary, but maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet \"off campus\" somewhere, that is fine. I will make sure that I have all the necessary decision makers present or \"on call,\" as well.115\nVillafaña told OPR that she offered to meet Lefkowitz away from the USAO because conducting negotiations via email was inefficient, and Villafaña wanted \"to have a meeting where we sat down and just finalized things.

Villafaña told the manager, \"As you can see . . . there are a number of things in their last draft that were unacceptable.
