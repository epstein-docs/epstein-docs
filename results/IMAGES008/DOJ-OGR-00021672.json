Sexual Abuse of Melissa\nOne of the minor girls Carolyn brought to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein was a 16-year-old named Melissa. (Tr.1753, 1758-61). Melissa went to Epstein's residence to provide Epstein with massages on multiple occasions when she was under the age of 18. (Id.). When Melissa and Carolyn went to the Palm Beach house, they remained in the home for about an hour and then returned with hundreds of dollars in cash. (Id.).\nB. The Defense Case, Verdict, and Sentencing\nMaxwell called nine witnesses in her defense case, including former employees and associates, as well as an expert on memory. (Tr.2327-2531, 2595-2684).\nOn December 29, 2021, the jury found Maxwell guilty of Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six. (A.86).\nOn April 1, 2022, Judge Nathan denied Maxwell's motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 based on a juror's provision of inaccurate information during jury selection, as discussed in greater deal in Point III, infra. (A.318-57). On April 29, 2022, Judge Nathan denied all but one of Maxwell's remaining post-trial motions. (A.358-402). Judge Nathan found that the three conspiracy counts (Counts One, Three, and Five) were multiplicious and that she would, therefore, enter judgment on Count Three alone among the conspiracy counts.
