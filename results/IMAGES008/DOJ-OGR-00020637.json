The Government has indicated that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8 weeks in advance of trial is insufficient.
