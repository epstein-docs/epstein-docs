(See Exhibit C.)\n\nThis motion concerns the defense requests for production of documents regarding important and essential issues in this case. Moreover, the public sphere is replete with information that the Inspector General of the United States opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein. (See article attached as Exhibit D.)\n\nAdditionally, it is undisputed that the Inspector General also conducted an extensive investigation into inner workings of the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\"). The United States Attorney General, William Barr and the Acting Bureau of Prisons commissioner, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer both made numerous public statements that the Inspector General was undertaking an in-depth investigation into the Bureau of Prisons' policies, procedures, staffing and criminal conduct as a direct result of the death of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC on August 10, 2019. (See Exhibit D.) This report is important because the defendant believes that this report will contain information that is material and relevant to his defense. Moreover, it is the defendant's assertion that staffing issues, staffing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP procedures go to the heart of his defense to the government's criminal allegations.\n\nThe government's response to Mr. Thomas' discovery request was not detailed and simply made a blanket denial without giving Mr. Thomas the respect to state any legal justification for the denial. Defendant, Thomas, therefore, brings this Motion to Compel, as to the items originally requested by his counsel.\n\nC.
