He made a conscious decision to share the fact of his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed the questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his interviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would not be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not followed the trial up to that point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in his interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had occurred. Juror 50's wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to his post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended to deceive.
