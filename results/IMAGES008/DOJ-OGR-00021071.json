In a trial about child sexual abuse, a juror's material misstatements on a juror Questionnaire, which allowed him to conceal the fact that he was a victim of child sexual abuse, and his post-verdict public statements about the effect of that traumatic experience on his participation as a juror in this case, satisfied the two prong test under McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v.
