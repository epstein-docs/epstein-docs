The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the jury on the core of criminality.\nSecond, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled in the Indictment and instructed by the Court. Jane testified that after she met the Defendant and Epstein at a summer camp, Epstein began engaging in sexual activity with her at his residence in Florida. Trial Tr. at 293–95, 305–06. Jane then began traveling with Epstein and the Defendant when she was fourteen years old. Id. at 315. As the Defendant notes, the majority of Jane's testimony discussing travel pertained to trips to New York and sexual activity that took place in New York. Maxwell Br. at 13. In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein's New York residence and the sexual acts that occurred there. See Trial Tr. at 316–20. She explained that while she “mainly” traveled to New York on Epstein's private plane, she also took commercial flights. Id. at 316. She further testified that the Defendant assisted in making these travel arrangements. Id. at 316–17. Corroborating evidence included flight records to New York and photos of Epstein's New York residence matching Jane's description. See id. at 320.\nIn addition to the New York trips, Jane testified about a trip she took to New Mexico with the Defendant and Epstein when she was fifteen or sixteen years old. Id. at 321. In her testimony regarding this trip, which spanned only three transcript pages, Jane explained that during the trip Epstein engaged in sexual activity with her similar to what took place in New York. See id. at 321–23. As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states, including Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant's intent. The testimony was part and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein's scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein's various properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New York for sexual activity illegal under New York law. Accordingly, this particular testimony was\n27\nDOJ-OGR-00021010",
