FIGGINS: Yes, your Honor.\n3 With respect to Mr. Thomas, last week, we asked for a\n4 week to get two additional cosigners. I would just ask the\n5 Court to give us another seven days. I've submitted the\n6 information to the U.S. Attorney's Office, but they still need\n7 to conduct their interview. I just don't want there to be any\n8 issues with respect to having it completed by tomorrow, so I\n9 would just ask the Court to extend it another seven days with\n10 respect to getting those signers and getting it approved.\n11 MS. DONALESKI: We have no objection to that, your\n12 Honor.\n13 THE COURT: All right. That deadline is extended by a\n14 week. And I certainly have no objection to the Middle District\n15 of Pennsylvania being included in those areas where Ms. Noel is\n16 permitted to travel.\n17 Is there anything further?\n18 MS. DONALESKI: We'll just request a ruling on our\n19 application to exclude time, your Honor.\n20 THE COURT: Yes. The application is granted. Time is\n21 excluded.\n22 Is that without objection?\n23 MR.
