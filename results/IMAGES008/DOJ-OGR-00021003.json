The Government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that two or more persons entered into the unlawful agreement charged; (2) the Defendant knowingly and willfully became a member of that conspiracy; (3) one of the members of the conspiracy knowingly committed at least one overt act; and (4) the overt act that the jury found to have been committed was committed in furtherance of that conspiracy. Jury Charge at 41.\n\nThe Court concludes that the trial evidence supported a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for each element of Count Three. The Government presented evidence that could lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the Defendant worked with Epstein between 1994 and 2004 to groom minor victims in an effort to transport them to New York to engage in sexual activity illegal under New York law. As noted above, Jane testified in detail about her travel to New York with the Defendant and Epstein where she was sexually abused. Trial Tr. at 319–20. Jane also testified about the steps taken by the Defendant and Epstein to make her feel comfortable before they began engaging in sexual activity with her and inviting her to travel. Id. 299–303; see also id. at 348 (Jane testifying that their behavior toward her made her \"feel special\").\n\nOther witnesses testified to similar conduct. Annie testified that after she met Epstein in New York, she was invited to travel with the Defendant and Epstein to New Mexico when she was sixteen. Id. at 2068-69, 2075–77. She testified that on this trip, the Defendant and Epstein took her shopping and to the movies. Id. at 2080–81. She also testified that the Defendant Epstein in exchange for money. Trial Tr. 1518–24. The Court concludes that the evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia was sufficient for the jury to convict the Defendant on Count Five.\n\n20\nDOJ-OGR-00021003",
