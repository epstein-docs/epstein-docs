Discussion\n\nJudge Nathan conducted a thorough inquiry and determined that Juror 50's inadvertent errors on the jury questionnaire did not undermine Maxwell's right to a fair trial. Maxwell does not meaningfully engage with Judge Nathan's careful opinion, instead suggesting that Juror 50's testimony at the hearing was \"patently absurd.\" (Br.63).

Juror 50 testified as much at the hearing, providing a detailed narrative of why his errors were a failure of diligence as he rushed through the questionnaire while distracted. (A.333-34).
