He told OPR that when he saw the provision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed \"co-conspirators\" as \"a message to any victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.\"\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told OPR that Epstein was always the \"focus\" of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed the federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face \"meaningful consequences\" for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, \"[t]o the extent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been the focus is on Epstein[ ] . . . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other, lesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.\" Acosta also told OPR that he assumed Villafaña and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate.

Villafaña precipitously revised a more narrow provision sought by the defense, it appears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the time, the subjects believed that was the purpose. However, the USAO had not indicated interest in prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record indicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecute fate of anyone other than the four assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the evidence does not show that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaña agreed to the non-prosecution provision to protect any of Epstein's political, celebrity, or other influential associates.242\n\nH.
