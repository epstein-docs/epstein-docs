ROOS: A week is appropriate, your Honor, for the two cosigners. THE COURT: Any objection from defendants? MR. FIGGINS: No, your Honor. MR. FOY: There is one. THE COURT: Okay. MR. FOY: Before today's proceedings, we did have an agreement on the terms of release. And, of course, as part of that process, pretrial services is involved and they're not necessarily privy to the terms of our agreement.
