DONALESKI: That's fine for the government, your\n2 Honor.\n3 THE COURT: How long do you expect the trial to last?\n4 MR. FOY: Your Honor, I would say it's fine. I mean,\n5 as it looks right now, but based on some of the things I'm\n6 anticipating, I don't know if that would be enough time and\n7 maybe we want to wait and see, because I need to see the\n8 discovery before I can say definitively that, yes, April 20 is\n9 an appropriate date. But for now certainly that would be fair.\n10 THE COURT: We're told that the discovery consists of\n11 video and documents. I don't understand why you can't\n12 anticipate whether you can go forward on the 20th.\n13 MR. FOY: Because I haven't seen what those documents\n14 are and what impact it might have on the defense of the case as\n15 well as my thoughts on some additional documents that may go\n16 beyond what they believe Rule 16 requires. I can imagine a\n17 situation where we feel that there's more to be provided than\n18 what the government provides. We're not there yet, so I'm not\n19 suggesting that it's definitely going to be an issue, but I did\n20 want to alert the Court early on of the possibility. But once\n21 I get the discovery, I'll be in a position to say more\n22 affirmatively.\n23 THE COURT: What else are you expecting?\n24 MR. FOY: You mean as far as discovery?\n25 THE COURT: You're talking in vague terms about\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nDOJ-OGR-00021981",
