He specified that \"a two-year term of state imprisonment\" was the minimum sentence that would satisfy the federal interest in the case. (Emphasis added.)

Menchel forwarded the redraft to Acosta, suggesting that they speak about it the next morning, as well as to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafaña.\n\nThe final letter, as shown on the following pages, was identical to Menchel's redraft, except that it omitted all reference to a federal plea under Rule 11(c).91\n\n91 Menchel told OPR that he did not disfavor Rule 11(c) pleas but knew that the USAO believed the judges were generally averse to them.
