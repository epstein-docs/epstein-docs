PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Attorney's Office's Handling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation\nIn 2006, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer's attitude had changed and, according to Reiter's statements in his 2009 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were credible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein to appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer's objectivity and the State Attorney's Office's approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his deposition:\nThis was a case that I felt absolutely needed the attention of the State Attorney's Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It's not generally something that's prosecuted in a federal court. And I knew that it didn't really matter what the facts were in this case, it was pretty clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute this case.\nOn May 1, 2006, Reiter submitted to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing package relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein first victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmittal letter, which was later made public, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Attorney's Office's \"treatment of these cases [to be] highly unusual.\"16 Reiter urged Krischer \"to examine the unusual course that your office's handling of this matter has taken\" and to consider disqualifying himself from prosecuting Epstein.17\nIII.

The case agent told Villafaña that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Attorney's Office was considering either not charging the case or allowing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor\n15    Fla.
