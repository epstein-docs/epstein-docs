There is the\n5    record that you put in the letter this morning that came in\n6    late -- early this morning that I reviewed this morning that we\n7    just discussed.

EVERDELL: Understood, your Honor.\n20   And I think the second point is that they are looking\n21   at the instructions that they have been given thus far because\n22   they reference the second element of Count Four.
