Unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in the Eleventh Circuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and principles of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution canon of construction, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto a plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors in a circuit where the very opposite rule applies, i.e. that ambiguities in plea agreements are to be resolved against the government. Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, even if the reference to \"the United States\" were deemed ambiguous, the ambiguity \"must be read against the government.\" U.S. v. Jefferies, 908 F.2d 1520, 1523 (11th Cir. 1990) (citing In re Arnett, 804 F.2d 1200, 1203 (11th Cir. 1986)); see also Rowe v. Griffin, 676 F.2d 524, 526 n.4 (11th Cir. 1982). And this result would bring the Eleventh Circuit in line with every circuit that has directly confronted this question (other than the Second Circuit).
