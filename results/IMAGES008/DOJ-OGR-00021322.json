USAM § 9-2.031: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and federal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the Department has a long-standing policy, known as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions charged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar conduct.192 The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set forth in USAM § 9-2.031, \"Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy ('Petite Policy'),\" which contains guidelines for a federal prosecutor's exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring a federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or federal proceeding. The policy applies \"whenever there has been a prior state or federal prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, or a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has attached.\"\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new federal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follows:\n\n(1) The matter must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether a substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis.
