And when I asked you questions about this -- you said that you didn't think that\n2       your family or friends would learn that you were a victim of\n3       sexual abuse, despite the press interviews. Do I have that right?\n4   A. Yes, your Honor.\n5   Q. And why didn't you think that?\n6   A. Well, I wasn't using my full name, and it's not ashamed -- I'm also not ashamed\n7       that it happened and it's something that multiple people\n8       that is relatively common that happened throughout the world.\n9   Q. And we talked about this, but you understood that there was\n10      a high level of press and public attention to the case.\n11      Correct?\n12  A. Yes, your Honor.\n13  Q. Help me reconcile that you didn't think your friends and family\n14      would learn about your sexual abuse with the fact that you were\n15      speaking publicly about it.\n16  A. The one thing that I can point to is that when my friends\n17      commented on my post, texted me, even harassing me about\n18      it, they didn't even know that this trauma was giving a little article about a juror\n19      or really in the news at all.\n20  Q. So I figured that I would find out about it?\n21  A. So you couldn't see how they would find out about it?\n22  Q. That wasn't something that I was --\n23  A. Yes, your Honor.\n24      \n25      \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\n\n41\nM3RYMAX2\n1   Q. And when I asked you questions, those one-on-one questions,\n2       did you pay attention to the instructions at that time?\n3   A. Yes, your Honor.\n4   Q. Did you listen carefully to my questions?\n5   A. Yes, your Honor.\n6   Q. Do you have any doubt that you answered those questions accurately?\n7   A. I answered every single one of those questions accurately.\n8   Q. Might you have failed to pay attention to the specifics of\n9       the questions in any way?\n10  A. Not at all, your Honor.\n11  Q. And do you know what, given how you approached the\n12      questionnaire?\n13  A. Because it was a different situation. I wasn't distracted.\n14      There weren't things going on. I wasn't sitting there for\n15      hours. It was multiple weeks later. So, again, I wasn't at\n16      that point, I wasn't thinking about my ex.\n17  Q. Would you say that you're distracted easily?\n18  A. I can become distracted, but it had no effect on my ability\n19      to listen to all the evidence given during the trial,\n20      serving in the jury, and listening to all the points.\n21  Q. And what was your approach to my instructions at various\n22      points?\n23  A. It was to follow them.\n24  Q. When you were testifying earlier -- and I asked you some\n25      \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00020910",
