To the contrary, in one video interview with the media, Juror 50 \"appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the questionnaire\" asked about his history of sexual abuse. (Id.).\n\nMaxwell does not directly challenge Judge Nathan's factual findings on this point, much less demonstrate that they are clearly erroneous. Instead, relying on United States v. Langford, 990 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. 1993), Maxwell argues that McDonough's first step is satisfied by any falsehood, deliberate or otherwise. (Br.66).\n\nThis argument misses the mark. This prong requires a showing of deliberate dishonesty by the juror, rather than mere honest mistake. This Court has explained that, in McDonough, the Supreme Court \"found that the juror's good faith failure to respond, though mistaken, did not satisfy even the first prong of the test.\" United States v. Shaoul, 41 F.3d 811, 815 (2d Cir. 1994). The defendant in Shaoul also relied on Langford to contend that a new trial was appropriate \"even if he cannot establish the juror's dishonesty.\" Id. This Court rejected that argument, concluding that \"[s]uch a contorted reading of Langford is incorrect, because it would eliminate the threshold requirement of the McDonough test: juror dishonesty.\" Id. And this Court concluded that the defendant failed to satisfy the first prong of the test because \"defense counsel explicitly conceded the good faith of the juror.\" Id. at 816; see United States v.
