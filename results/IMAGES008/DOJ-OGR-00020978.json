This common occurrence is not necessarily nefarious. See Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 440.

Id. As noted above in this Court's finding that Juror 50 is not actually biased, Juror 50's statements regarding his post-trial view of the verdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror's view of a case and defendant would necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors of the Defendant's guilt. See Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 439-40.

The Defendant relies on Juror 50's statements in post-trial interviews and his hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 50 noted at the hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews \"in order to talk to a reporter about jury deliberations\" and to explain why he \"believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was provided during the trial.\" Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial matter, that these statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common sense and life experiences to adjudicate guilt.
