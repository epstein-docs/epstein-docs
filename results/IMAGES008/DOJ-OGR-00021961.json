Even if you have already made statements to the authorities, you need not make any further statements. Any statements that you do make can be used against you. You have the right to be released, either conditionally or unconditionally, pending trial unless I find that there are no conditions that would reasonably assure your presence in court or the safety of the community. You have the right to be represented by an attorney during all court proceedings, including this one and during all questioning by the authorities. If you cannot afford an attorney, I will appoint one to represent you. I understand that each of you has retained private counsel. If at any point in time you run out of money and you are unable to afford counsel, you can petition the Court to appoint counsel at the government's expense and at no cost to you. You both have been charged in a six-count indictment, and I will just state that I understand that Judge Torres has referred this not just for presentment but also for arraignment. MR. ROOS: That's correct, your Honor. THE COURT: The defendants have both been charged in a six-count indictment. SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 DOJ-OGR-00021961",
