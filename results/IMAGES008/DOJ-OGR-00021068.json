The Trial\n\nThe evidence at trial was based on the testimony of four women - Jane, Carolyn, Annie Farmer, and Kate.\n\nJane testified that she met Epstein and Maxwell in 1994 when she was 14 and that, shortly thereafter, Epstein began sexually abusing her. Jane testified that the sexual abuse occurred in Florida, New York, and New Mexico and that Maxwell was in the room \"more than twice.\" Tr. 308-311; 340. But in interviews with the Government, prior to trial, Jane stated that she had no memory of Maxwell being present when she and Epstein engaged in sexual contact (Tr. 477) and that she was not sure if Maxwell had ever touched her. Tr. 475-6, 479-80.\n\nCarolyn testified that she gave Epstein massages that involved sexual contact in exchange for money in Florida between 2001 and 2004. Carolyn testified that in 2001 when she was 14, Virginia Giuffre, then 18, introduced her to Epstein. Tr. 1574-5. Maxwell would sometimes call to set up appointments and pay Carolyn. Maxwell saw her naked in the massage room a few times and once touched her breasts and buttocks. Carolyn spoke to the FBI and the AUSA-SDFL in 2007 and never mentioned Maxwell. Tr. 1604-5, 1620 1679. In 2008, Carolyn sued Epstein and Kellen for the exact same conduct she ascribed to Maxwell at trial, but never mentioned Maxwell in her detailed complaint. Tr. 1571, 1617.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-00021068",
