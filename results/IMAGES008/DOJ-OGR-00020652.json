ENDORSEMENT: After conferring with the District Executive and the United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York, the Court denies the request. The U.S. Marshall has a generally applicable policy that prohibits inmates being held in the Courthouse cellblocks from possessing any materials or items. The circumstances do not warrant an exception to that policy. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/14/2021)(bw) (Entered: 04/14/2021)\n04/15/2021 | 202 | MOTION to Continue Trial Date. Document filed by Ghislaine Maxwell. (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 04/15/2021)\n04/16/2021 | 203 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the parties' joint letter responding to the Court's March 29, 2021 Order. The parties agree that the redactions to pages 118 and 119 are no longer necessary. The Defendant continues to press for the redactions on pages 129134. However, for the reasons stated in the Court's March 29, 2021 Order, the information is already part of the public record in this case and accordingly the proposed redactions are unnecessary and overbroad. Dkt. No. 189; see also United States v. Nejad, No. 18-CR-224 (AJN), 2021 WL 681427, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2021). For the reasons stated in the Court's March 18, 2021 and March 29, 2021 Orders, the Court approves the limited redactions to Exhibit 11 to the Government's brief, except for the language quoted in the Indictment, which is already part of the public record. The Government is therefore ORDERED to docket its omnibus memorandum of law, along with the corresponding exhibits, by 3:00 p.m. today, consistent with the Court's orders regarding redactions. The parties are further ORDERED to docket their April 1, 2021 joint letter; if either side believes that portions of that letter should be redacted, they shall propose redactions by April 19, 2021.
