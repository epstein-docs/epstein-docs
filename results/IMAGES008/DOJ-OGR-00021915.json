MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, started his shift in the SHU at 12 a.m. on August 10. From 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, NOEL and THOMAS were the only two officers on duty in the SHU. 16. During the time period from 4 p.m. on August 9 to 8 a.m. on August 10, the officers on duty in the SHU, including TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were responsible for conducting five institutional counts: 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 9; and 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. on August 10. NOEL, THOMAS and the other officers on duty were also responsible for completing paperwork attesting to each of those counts. While, as detailed herein, count slips were completed for each institutional count, in fact, not a single one of those institutional counts was done. 17. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-1 were responsible for conducting the 4 p.m. institutional count in the SHU. As video from the MCC's internal video surveillance system makes clear, NOEL and Officer-1 did not perform the 4 p.m. count. Nonetheless, NOEL and Officer-1 completed and signed a count slip that falsely stated that the 4 p.m. institutional count had been performed. In reliance on that falsified count slip, at approximately 5:03 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 4 p.m. count. 8 DOJ-OGR-00021915",
