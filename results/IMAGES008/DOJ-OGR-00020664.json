(Pomerantz, Lara) (Entered: 05/10/2021)\n05/11/2021 276 LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Bobbi C. Sternheim dated 05/10/2021 re: Request for November 8th trial start date (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 05/11/2021)\n05/11/2021 277 ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court has considered the parties' proposals regarding the commencement of trial. Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the Government's letter, the Court will request November 29, 2021 from the Clerk's Office as the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office consistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to the jury. However, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury selection occur during the week of November 15. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The Court grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2021. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2021, outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allow adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2021. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in advance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose adjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 30 minutes by phone regarding the overall pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint letter by May 14, 2021. The Court will accept only a joint letter with a joint proposal or with each sides views briefly stated. The letter must attest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed letters will be struck. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/11/2021) (lnl) (Entered: 05/11/2021)\nhttps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?210870152221896-L_1_0-1 42/113 DOJ-OGR-00020664",
