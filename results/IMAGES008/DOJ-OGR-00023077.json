[a] judge's tolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation on the part of victims . . . . 63\n\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning a sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district court in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence that differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range. 64\n\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\n\nThe way the matter came to the office was, the state wasn't doing enough. It didn't provide for prison time. It didn't provide for registration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal issues . . . . There were witness issues. And . . . we could go to trial . . . and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at a pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went back and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a state pre-indictment resolution.\n\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, \"there was a preference for deferring to the state\" because, in part, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution rather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be \"uncharted territory.\" Acosta explained that he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the Epstein case played out, the federal role became \"more intrusive\" than he had anticipated, because the defense tried to get the state to \"circumvent and undermine\" the outcome.\n\nAttorney's Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand jury because the State Attorney's Office \"didn't like the case\" and wanted \"political cover\" for declining the case or proceeding on a lesser charge.\n\n63    Menchel told OPR, however, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were generally viewed as \"pro-prosecution.\"\n\n64    Acosta said that \"dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule 11 is not something that [South Florida federal district] judges tend to do.\" Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District of Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as \"Rule 11(c) pleas.\"\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) allows the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of a plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court does not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafaña told OPR that Rule 11(c) pleas were \"uncommon\" in the Southern District of Florida, as the \"judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to impose.\" Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as averse to Rule 11(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafaña told OPR that she had never offered a Rule 11(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-00023077",
