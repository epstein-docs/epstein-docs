  "full_text": "Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page207 of 217\nSA-461\nM6s2Max2\n92\n1    The sentence I impose must reflect the gravity of\n2    Ms. Maxwell's conduct, of Ms. Maxwell's offense, the pivotal\n3    role she played in facilitating the offense, and the\n4    significant and lasting harm it inflicted. So, too, must the\n5    sentence promote respect for the law, provide just punishment,\n6    and afford adequate deterrence.\n7\n8    As I have described, this scheme was long-lasting, it\n9    was far-reaching, it was horribly damaging to the victims.\n10   Just punishment and promotion of respect for the law, it\n11   demands a substantial sentence that meets the scope of the\n12   conduct and the scope of the harm.\n13   Moreover, general deterrence is critically important\n14   to the sentence I will impose. A substantial sentence will\n15   send an unmistakable message that those who engage in and\n16   facilitate the sexual abuse and trafficking of underaged\n17   victims will be held accountable by the law.\n18   As the probation department stated, a significant\n19   sentence should promote general deterrence against the\n20   exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this\n21   offense, and I fully agree. But let me be clear that\n22   Ms. Maxwell is wealthy or that this case is high profile is not\n23   a basis for increasing punishment in any regard, but the rule\n24   of law demands, and this Court must ensure that, whether you\n25   are rich or poor, powerful or entirely unknown, nobody is above\n26   the law. That message serves the important interest in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00021637",
