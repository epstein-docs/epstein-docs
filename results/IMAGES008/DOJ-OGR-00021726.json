That is the issue Judge Nathan instructed the jury to resolve, and that is the criminal conduct charged in Counts Three and Four of the Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive amendment or variance occurred.\n\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nCounts Three and Four charged Maxwell with arranging for Jane's transportation to New York with the intent that Jane would engage in sex acts with Epstein, in violation of New York state law, and with a conspiracy to transport minors to New York for the same purpose. (A.127-30). At trial, the Government marshalled evidence that Maxwell transported Jane to New York, and aided and abetted Epstein in doing so, with the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity there. That evidence included detailed testimony from Jane about Epstein's New York residence (Tr.316-19)\n\nDOJ-OGR-00021726",
