With regard to the content of the telephone calls, Villafaña proposed the following language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein investigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him to register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of 18 months imprisonment followed by one year of home confinement. Mr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of restitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a letter that AUSA Villafaña is going to send out. Do you have a lawyer? Get name or address. If not[,] where do you want [the] letter sent? If you have questions when you receive the letter, please understand that we cannot provide legal advice but the lawyers at the following victim rights organizations are able to help you at no cost to you. (Provide names and phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them know that counseling is still available even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 21, 2008, Villafaña sent the letter to the 11 unrepresented victims whose addresses the FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafaña provided Epstein's defense counsel with a copy of the letter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July - August 2008: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Letter to Victims Residing Outside of the United States\n\nWhile attempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact information for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2008, respectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmitted an automated VNS form notification letter to each victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n\n371 A month later, in an August 18, 2008 letter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government's victim list to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2007 execution of the NPA. Villafaña also raised with Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to include new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2008 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously given a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafaña sent the defense a letter confirming that the government's July 10, 2008 victim list was \"the final list.\"\n238\nDOJ-OGR-00021440",
