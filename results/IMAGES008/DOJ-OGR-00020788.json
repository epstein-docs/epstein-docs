The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (1) records of witness interviews in connection with an ex parte declaration in support of a response to a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a personal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued for Maxwell's records as part of its investigation in this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has reviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents includes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the Government's representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are covered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the terms of the statute. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3500; Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145. Next, the Government represents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and so that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third party, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them. See United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Finally, Maxwell's request for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal basis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and Giglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady and that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-00020788",
