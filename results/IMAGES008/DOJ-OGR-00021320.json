APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Attorneys' Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Attorneys' Manual (USAM) includes general statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and desirable practices to be followed, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial responsibilities.189 The goal of the USAM is to promote \"the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,\" and to promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made \"rationally and objectively on the merits of each case.\" USAM § 9-27.001.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of government attorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing guidance rather than mandating results. Id.; see also USAM § 9-27.120, comment (\"It is expected that each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law enforcement responsibilities . . . However, it is not intended that reference to these principles will require a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.\"); USAM § 9-27.110, comment (\"Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when, whom, how, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.\"). However, USAM § 9-27.130 provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal prosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM § 9-27.130 states that each U.S. Attorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that prosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with the principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles set forth in the USAM are followed by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary sanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Attorneys have \"plenary authority with regard to federal criminal matters\" and may modify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.001, 9.27-140. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department's Criminal Resource Manual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal prosecutions.\n\n1. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a Federal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every matter referred to them. USAM § 9-2.020 explicitly authorizes a U.S. Attorney \"to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n189 In 2018, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects' conduct, OPR relies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue.
