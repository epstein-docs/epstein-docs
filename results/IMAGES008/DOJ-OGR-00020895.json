I never thought that I was chosen to sit on this jury. I -- I honestly never thought I would be super early, and I get here early and it took 45 minutes just to get through the security line. And we get ushered into a room --\nQ. I will come back and ask you some questions about the process for filling it out --\nA. Got it.\nQ. -- for this question, just with respect to this question,\nA. Got it.\nQ. At this point I was super distracted because I was sat literally within four feet of the table where everybody was dropping off of their questionnaires. People were asking questions, there was papers being ripped off the questionnaire packets, and there's a lot of talking going on, and there's super distracting. I'm like: I want to finish. So I just went through and marking it. I didn't spend a whole lot of time thinking about the questions as I'm going through and marking it.\nQ.

So the incident that you described in response to 48 in which, as I understand it, you informed your mother when you were in high school that when you were nine or ten a family member had engaged in sexual abuse with you, is that correct?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So why is that not responsive to question 497\nA. Because I don't consider them part of my family. I never considered them part of my family even when they lived with us for a few years, when you got to\nQ. And when you filled out the questionnaire, when you got to this question were you thinking about what happened to you but you didn't respond yet because you didn't consider them a family member, or you didn't consider it at all.\nA.
