FOY: Well, your Honor, based on our view of the case, I believe there are outside circumstances that are driving this prosecution that may impact certain information that's available to us in the regular discovery.\nIt's hard for me to say without seeing anything, so right now it's just kind of in my mind, and I don't want to mislead the Court to suggest it's all going to be finished in time for April 20. It may be, and that may be fine, but it's hard for me to say having not received or reviewed the discovery. I've only seen the indictment.\nI'm just alerting the Court. I'm not saying we can't do it, but I don't want to not say it when it's something that could potentially be an issue. I'm not saying we're trying to hold it up or slow down the pace unnecessarily, but I can see getting information that may impact on the defense in particular, Brady material in particular.\nTHE COURT: Brady material?\nMR. FOY: Correct, but it's hard to say specifically without seeing the discovery.\nTHE COURT: All right. You have not persuaded me. I'm setting the trial for April 20.\nHow long do you expect the trial to go?\nMS. DONALESKI: Approximately a week, your Honor, for the government's case.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
