  "full_text": "Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page27 of 113\n\nThe Government announced its arrest of Maxwell on July 2, 2020, the anniversary of Epstein's indictment. From that day, Maxwell was held in solitary confinement in the Brooklyn Detention Center. As COVID raged, the District Court denied four bail applications and dozens of applications to ameliorate Maxwell's deplorable conditions of confinement. By the time of trial, Maxwell was so disoriented and diminished that she was unable meaningfully to assist in her own defense, much less to testify.\n\nAs trial approached, the vilification of Maxwell was unprecedented in both scale and severity. The bipartisan political pressure to obtain a conviction was enormous. Judge Nathan refused to apply the NPA to Maxwell in accordance with its terms and refused to dismiss the case as time-barred. She precluded Maxwell from presenting a meaningful defense by excluding evidence and argument that was central to her defense, such as the NPA, the 2006 FBI investigation, the terms of the VCP, and the direct involvement of the complainants' civil attorneys in both the VCP and the Government's investigation.\n\nThe trial itself involved the testimony of four women, three of whom (Jane, Kate, and Carolyn), were permitted to testify under pseudonyms. The result transformed the trial into a form of Kabuki theater designed to remind the jury at every turn that these adult women were being protected because their privacy interests, and not Maxwell's constitutional right to a public trial, were paramount.\n12\nDOJ-OGR-00021074",
