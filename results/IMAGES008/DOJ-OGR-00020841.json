And so the question is about the element;\n2 the charge is about that particular element. I think more\n3 guesswork here makes this more confusing and not less\n4 confusing. I think, as the Court pointed out, some aspects of\n5 this note are about aiding and abetting. And so even referring\n6 the jury just to instruction number 21 leaves out that aspect\n7 of the jury's deliberations and their determination on this\n8 particular issue. And so we think the safest course is to\n9 provide the jury with applicable law in this area, and they can\n10 find the facts as they see fit and as they apply to these\n11 particular instructions.\n12 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't think this is a\n13 question about aid and abetting, broadly speaking. I think\n14 they are talking about the flights to and from New Mexico. I\n15 think that much is pretty clear from the note. And whether or\n16 not Ms. Maxwell had anything to do with arranging that\n17 travel --\n18 THE COURT: But your legal contention is she can't be\n19 found guilty of this count unless the jury concludes that she\n20 aided in the transportation to New Mexico.\n21 That's not legally accurate, is it?\n22 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the instruction itself says\n23 it has to be a significant or motivating purpose for the travel\n24 across state lines.\n25 THE COURT: Right.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\nDOJ-OGR-00020841",
