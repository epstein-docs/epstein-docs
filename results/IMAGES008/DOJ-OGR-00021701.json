But Richardson, which was decided before Landgraf, is \"inconsistent with Landgraf.\" United States v. Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d 619, 630 (E.D. Va. 2019). Specifically, Richardson focused on whether Congress expressed a \"clear intention\" to overcome the presumption against retroactivity, 512 F.2d at 106, without engaging in Landgraf's second step, i.e., considering whether the statute \"would have retroactive effect,\" Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280. Moreover, unlike the 2003 amendment, the statute at issue in Richardson did not expressly provide that \"[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution\" of the relevant offense \"shall preclude\" prosecution under the terms of the amended statute.\nIn sum, the statute of limitations for the charges in the Indictment had not yet expired when the 2003 amendment to Section 3283 extended the limitations period, and Judge Nathan correctly determined that applying the 2003 amendment in this case does not create impermissible retroactive effects. Therefore,\nDOJ-OGR-00021701",
