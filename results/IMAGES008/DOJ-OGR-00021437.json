The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.364 Moreover, the attorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in the PBPD's investigation and had been deposed by Epstein's attorneys in the state case (with the Assistant State Attorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 30, 2008 plea hearing from the State Attorney's Office.365 Similarly, another of the victims the state had subpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her attorney that she received subpoenas from the State Attorney's Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing.
