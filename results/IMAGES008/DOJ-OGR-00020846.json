MOE: Your Honor, I think that's exactly why we\n12 proposed directing the jurors to the entirety of the\n13 instruction, which says just that. The second paragraph of\n14 that same instruction reminds the jury, as the instruction does\n15 throughout, that we're talking about New York Penal Law,\n16 Section 130.55.
