She testified that she confided in\n2 the defendant that her mother was an alcohol and that she had\n3 been raped and molested by her grandfather starting at a very\n4 young age. The defendant, aware of this knowledge, used it to\n5 subject Carolyn to a continuing cycle of sexual abuse.

For\n8 years, Carolyn was paid for the sexualized massages, including\n9 personally paid by the defendant.\n10 Similar patterns of conduct were described by other\n11 witnesses. Indeed, the criminal conduct established at trial\n12 was extensive and it was far-reaching. Ms. Maxwell and Epstein\n13 victimized multiple underaged girls using this pattern, this\n14 playbook, over the span of many years and in a variety of\n15 locations. And the damage done to these young girls was\n16 incalculable. They did bravely testify at trial about what\n17 happened to them despite the extraordinary difficulty that\n18 entailed.
