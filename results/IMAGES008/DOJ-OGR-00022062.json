Apr. 20, 2020).\nThe Chief Judge further ordered that time be excluded for all criminal trials under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), from April 27, 2020 to June 15, 2020, noting that \"[t]he [c]ourt may further extend the period of exclusion as circumstances may warrant.\" In re: Coronavirus/COVID-19 Pandemic (Extension of Time Under the Speedy Trial Act), 20 Misc. 196, ECF No. 1 ¶ 6 (S.D.N.Y.
