Statutes of Limitations for Offenses Against Children (18 U.S.C. § 3283) and Child Abduction and Sex Offenses (18 U.S.C. § 3299)\n\nMost federal noncapital offenses carry a five-year statute of limitations. See 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a). In 1990, Congress enacted a provision titled, \"Extension of Child Statute of Limitations,\" which provided that \"[n]o statute of limitation that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of 18 years shall preclude such a prosecution before the child reaches the age of 25 years.\" Crime Control Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-647, tit. II, § 225(a), 104 Stat. 4789, 4798 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (1990)). This provision \"extended the federal criminal limitations period for child sex abuse offenses, making it easier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that may be difficult to detect quickly.\" Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2017). In 1994, Congress re-codified this provision, moving it to 18 U.S.C. § 3283 with identical language. Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, tit. XXXIII, § 330018(a), 108 Stat. 1796, 2149 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (1994)).\n\nWithin a decade, \"Congress began to view even the extended statute of limitations period in the 1994 version of § 3283 as 'inadequate in many cases' because it released from criminal liability sex abusers whose crimes were not brought to the attention of federal authorities until after their victims turned twenty-five.\" Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54 (citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No.\n\nDOJ-OGR-00021689",
